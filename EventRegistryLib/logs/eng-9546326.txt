Spencer Cox, per the press release. \"We lead the nation in volunteering and charitable giving every year and this spirit of community leads to a collaborative approach to problem solving, an ecosystem that supports innovation, and a culture that strengthens families and individuals. I'm proud of the Beehive State and appreciate the validation that Utah really is the best state in the nation.\"\n\nUtah ranked in the top 20 of seven of the eight categories and top three in three of them:\n\nOther categories involved in the ranking of the states included crime, health care, natural environment, fiscal stability, infrastructure and opportunity.\n\nRegarding economic rankings, Utah fell from the top of the list to third overall. \"It's important to acknowledge that a No. 3 ranking isn't a bad ranking,\" Phil Dean, chief economist at the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute, told the Deseret News.\n\nOne aspect of this is \"we have seen some moderation in our job growth rates. I think some of that is related to the tech sector or some of the financial service sector, where we have a stronger presence than the rest of the U.S. economy,\" Dean added. \"Those sectors are sensitive to interest rates, and with higher interest rates, we see impacts there. That being said, that's not true for the entire economy. So we're seeing portions of our economy where we're seeing flatter growth, or even a little bit of decline, where most of the economy is still growing quite well.\"\n\nDean said Utah's large population of young people is also a big benefit to Utah's economy. \"We're feeling the impacts of baby boomer retirements here in Utah, but it impacts us less than other states. Our diverse economy certainly helps us.\"\n\nSomething that Dean emphasized is unique to Utah is the ability to think about the greater good rather than allowing a political divide to influence decisions.\n\n\"You know, looking at an NHL announcement downtown and looking at people from a bunch of different groups throughout the state that were represented, that kind of shows this ability that we have, as a state, to come together still,\" he said. \"We may disagree, but if possible, we'll try to work toward a win-win solution.\"\n\nAlthough Utah has the second-most national parks, behind only California, its worst ranking was in the natural environment category. Sitting in 46th place, the state does not prioritize government policies geared toward environmental initiatives related to public health, according to U.S. News.\n\n\"As many as 131.2 million people in the U.S. live where the air quality gets failing grades due to too-high levels of ozone or particle pollution,\" the Deseret News previously reported, and Utah is no exception.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beehive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beehive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Cox_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Cox (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_&_World_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. News & World Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baby boomers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ozone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deseret News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/e27ce3b7d3011a71c2bcc4322e9225f1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546326", "eventUri": "eng-9546326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Spencer Cox said in a statement. \"We lead the nation in volunteering and charitable giving every year and this spirit of community leads to a collaborative approach to problem solving, an ecosystem that supports innovation, and a culture that strengthens families and individuals.\"\n\nStates were evaluated in eight categories: health care, education, economy, infrastructure, opportunity, fiscal stability, crime and corrections, and natural environment. More than 70 metrics and tens of thousands of data points were considered, including things like employment, internet access, affordability, and public safety. (Washington, DC, was not included in the analysis.)\n\nIn recent years, Utah has become a hub for startups and tech entrepreneurs. The state also had a low unemployment rate of just 2.8% in March, which was less than the national rate of 3.8% that same month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"It's just a fantastic place to live and work,\" says real estate broker Joel Carson, at Utah Real Estate based in Salt Lake City.

Notably, Utah received the top ranking in the country for broadband subscriptions.\n\nThe Beehive State also saw improvement in the crime and corrections category, jumping from spot no. 15 in 2023 to no. nine this year.\n\nNow, Utah didn't totally sweep the board and a few categories saw worse performance compared to 2023.\n\nUtah's \"Environment\" ranking was 46, the same as last year. The report states Utah's air quality, pollution health risk and industrial toxins are among the worst in the country.\n\nWhile Utah jumped ahead in the \"opportunity\" category, securing spot no. 18 compared to 20 in 2023, researchers highlighted that Utah is ranked 49 out of all 50 states for equality. Metrics such as pay gap by gender, labor force participation gap by gender, income and education gaps by race and employment gaps were analyzed.\n\nCost of living is also included in the \"opportunity\" category, which has been a common complaint for Utahns in recent years. While Utah's affordability was ranked overall at no. 27 nationwide, housing affordability specifically was slightly lower at 35.\n\nOther categories that also saw decreases in 2024 compared to 2023 include economy, falling from the top spot in 2023 to no. 3 this year, fiscal stability, falling from no. 1 to no. 6 and health care, which ranked at no. 14 this year and no. 7 in 2023.\n\nIn response to Utah's repeat top state ranking, Utah Governor Spencer Cox released his thoughts on social media, saying he was proud of the accomplishment.\n\n\"Utah has a vibrant, diverse economy and unsurpassed natural beauty, but what truly sets our state apart is our people,\" Cox said in part. \"Our people are charitable, collaborative, innovative and work together to strengthen families and individuals.

They can charitably be called interesting.\n\nRyan Smith, the owner of the Utah Jazz and MLS's Real Salt Lake who recently purchased the Arizona Coyotes franchise, posted a survey on social media Wednesday. \"Utah! Our NHL team is here. Help us choose a name,\" he wrote, along with a link to Qualtrics, the survey software company that made him billions.\n\nThe team will wear jerseys with \"Utah\" across the chest during the 2024-25 season, similar to the interim branding employed by the PWHL and Washington Football Team. In the meantime, fans can vote for up to four teams out of 20 compiled from an earlier Qualtrics survey asking for suggestions. The following round and next steps will be announced this summer, the survey said.\n\nSome of the names on the list paid homage to the region's weather, like the Utah Blizzard, or its skiing culture, like the Utah Black Diamonds. Others connected to the \"Beehive State\" nickname: Utah Swarm and Utah Hive. One took a page from the Kraken's book with a mythological creature, the Utah Yeti, while another proved an attempt to copy from soccer with Utah HC. One suggestion, the Utah Caribou, could lead to some marketing efforts around the holidays.\n\nMany of the options sound more like minor league baseball teams than an NHL franchise, and a large portion of them take on the collective noun often found in teams outside of the men's four major professional leagues, like the San Diego Wave or the LA Galaxy. A few of them simply fall flat; no offense, Utah Ice.\n\nWhen Smith bought the team from Alex Meruelo, the Arizonan kept the rights to the Coyotes branding with hopes of restarting the franchise as an expansion team. The Utah cohort has to implement several changes in addition to getting a new team name, including making upgrades to the Delta Center, securing a practice facility, and selling tickets. Luckily for Smith, fans have already embraced the team -- Smith announced they'd received more than 20,000 season-ticket deposits less than 24 hours after the relocation became official.\n\nNow the fans get a rare say in their team name in voting open until May 22.

No more hassle. According to a lot of people, this is the most important issue in Utah sports today.\n\nAnd as former Jazz player Greg Foster once famously put it when talking about the team that had to hit the gas hard when the NBA playoffs arrived, when the Jazz actually made the playoffs: It's time to cut nuts. That reference, I was told, had nothing to do with castrating sheep or other critters, or cutting the bolts from the sides of a ship's hull in the final stages of construction, and everything to do with collecting nuts at the end of the autumn season. , before the animals wandered off with them all or before they were buried in the first layer of winter ice.\n\nWhere were we?\n\nAh, yes, ice, and Utah's name for the team that skates on it. We've all come up with about a hundred ideas, thousands of them, some serious, some mediocre, some bordering on madness. Although the Utah Lunatics aren't really on the lists I've seen. Now end the madness and go straight to the largest number of candidates, the ones who have recently been trademarked by a certain power center for what the name durn should be.\n\nUtah ice cream Utah may be the winter sports capital of the world, or at least of the United States, and while Ice gives a nice icy feeling, it's too redundant. The team skates on ice, so it seems a bit redundant to name the team after the surface it plays on. It would be like naming a football team Turf or Gridiron, or a basketball team Hardwood, or a baseball team Diamond. No one would do that because it just doesn't work.\n\nUtah Yetis This seems to be popular, but there are only a few hang-ups. The first is that this was once the mascot name for the Colorado Avalanche, and that's a no-go. Second, if my research is correct, Yeti refers to the hairy mountain beast that hangs out in the Himalayas, better known in this country as the Abominable Snowman. What exactly does a legend from Tibet have to do with the Beehive State? Nothing.\n\nUtah Outlaws Admittedly, that's a cool name and the possibilities for a logo might be pretty cool. But does Utah's hockey team really want to be named after criminals? People known for ignoring and violating the rule of law? You might as well call the team the Politicians.\n\nUtah gif Yes, there are seven different species of rattlesnakes in the state, and that scares the bejeebers out of me when I take the family dog for a walk in the mountains or even around the block. I saw a dead rattlesnake in the middle of a neighborhood road last summer. I saw two on a crazy golf course. They say you can get your dog trained to avoid being bitten, but when people have trouble staying away from such venomous snakes, you're not sure how Rags and Fido, even if trained, would stay safe comment. Does Utah really want the image of a snake on its hockey team, on its team flags, pennants, blankets, T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets and pajamas? Who wants your sleep or the sleep of your children to be disturbed by nightmares because of images of sidewinders sliding across your face after hockey games? Not me.\n\nUtah rage What are Utahns angry about? I looked up the strict definition of anger and it was: intense, disordered, and often destructive anger. Really, is that what we want? Secondary meanings were: one of the avenging gods in Greek mythology who torments criminals, oh, like Outlaws? and cause plagues. We've had enough plagues around here lately. No one wants to conjure up images of, say, Utah COVID. Also: a vengeful spirit, especially a hateful woman, folks, was better than that, or extreme fierceness or violence. How about the Utah Brutality or the Utah Slaughterers. No and no.\n\nUtah Mammoth It's clumsy and awkward. An extinct hairy elephant.\n\nUtah Hockey Club or Utah HC This hammers home the idea that no one in Utah is smart or creative enough to come up with a real name. That doesn't make the state unique, it makes it look stupid, the way the pioneers and then their descendants ran out of ideas when they crossed the plains to get here.\n\nSnowstorm in Utah I understand that this ties into the idea of snow, which is something we need to live and survive here, water being the source of life in the desert and all, no matter how difficult it can be for driving conditions. from November to May, and it perpetuates the double-Z theme initiated with the Jazz, call them the Blizz and that can be a good or a bad thing. I still haven't been able to fully embrace the idea of another team name that a) goes all in on the kitsch of the two Z's, and b) is singular, not plural. I'll take lions and tigers and bears, oh my, over the heat and the thunder and, yes, the jazz.\n\nFill-in-the-blank exercises in Utah Since we still don't know what the name will end up being, and since trademarked names may still be a bit of a ruse, guess and guess quickly, because you know what time it is? Yes, you take his time collecting all the nuts. The Utah nuts?

However, they should have one sooner than later.\n\nRyan Smith, the leader of Utah's NHL ownership group (SEG), asked fans to help come up with name ideas back in April via a survey. With plenty of submissions in the bank, Smith launched another survey on Wednesday night, allowing voters to choose among the most popular ideas.\n\nThe first round of voting, which is open until May 22, invites fans to vote for up to four preferred NHL team names from an initial list of 20 options\n\nAccording to the ownership group, \"Once the team name has been selected, SEG will work diligently to craft the team identity - logo, mascot, colours, and other branding elements - which will debut for the 2025-26 NHL season.\"\n\nLike any brainstorming session, Utah's name pool has a handful of duds. From the not-so-catchy to the bizarre, here's our ranking of each submission still in the running.\n\n20. Utah Powder\n\nWe can only assume this is a synonym for snow. In any case, powder is neither intimidating nor unique, and would likely spark countless memes for the wrong reasons.\n\nUtah Ice doesn't have a terrible ring to it, but it's pretty generic to model your club's identity around the surface a sport is played on.\n\nWhen it comes to names and mascots, people like to rally around something specific related to the region (e.g. The St. Louis Blues or Edmonton Oilers). Blast is not that.\n\nPlus, the state already has a youth soccer organization bearing the same name.\n\n17. Utah HC\n\nNaming your club after the city is quite common in soccer and even European hockey, but not so much in the NHL.\n\nWhile it's better than having a bad name, it lacks flavour and distinction. Plus, Utah will already play out their inaugural season without a name anyway.\n\n16. Utah Squall\n\nA squall is defined as a sudden strong wind or short storm signalling the approach of a hurricane.\n\nAlong with the Carolina Hurricanes, the NHL already has plenty of weather-related team names such as Lightning and Avalanche.\n\nThe Utah Black Diamonds is a premier-level Major League Pickleball team. Additionally, a women's hockey team in Salt Lake City also operates under the name.\n\nThat doesn't mean the NHL can't use it, but there are far better options on the board.\n\n11. Utah Hive\n\nThis one makes a lot of sense as the official state insect of Utah is the honeybee. A beehive also appears on Utah's state flag.\n\nHowever, Hive sounds more like a nickname for an arena or fan base in Salt Lake City than a team itself.\n\nPaying respect to the region's beautiful nature, Glaciers is a pretty majestic name.\n\nBut if they wanted something big and slowly moving, maybe the modern game of hockey isn't the best place for it.\n\n9. Utah Mountaineers\n\nMountains are another signature part of Utah's identity, appearing prominently on the state's flag.\n\nBut while the name does evoke some strong imagery, it's just not that catchy.\n\n8. Utah Fury\n\nWith two syllables and alliteration with the letter \"U,\" overall, Fury is a pretty solid choice if they want to play it safe.\n\n7. Utah Swarm\n\nUnlike the Hive, the Swarm exudes the toughness of a flying, stinging insect like the bee.\n\n6. Utah Caribou\n\nYou have to admit, antlers would look phenomenal on a hockey jersey.\n\n5. Utah Canyons\n\nAnother regional option, but Canyons might be too close to home.\n\nThe world's most famous canyon is located next door, with the Grand Canyon spanning across much of Arizona.\n\nDespite having teams in Texas and Tennessee, the NHL has never really gone all-in on a Western theme. This would be their chance.\n\n3. Utah Mammoth\n\nThe Mammoth would be a dream name for commentators and merchandisers alike, with the mascot probably quickly becoming a fan fave across the NHL.\n\nHowever, if SEG is searching for originality, the Mammoth wouldn't even be the only team in the area with the name, with the Denver-based Colorado Mammoth competing in the National Lacrosse League.\n\n2.

Which is best?", "body": "(Rick Egan | The Salt Lake Tribune) Fans fill the Delta Center for an event introducing the Utah NHL team on Wednesday, April 24, 2024.\n\nOK, let's get serious about this serious business of seriously naming Utah's serious new NHL team. No more fooling around. According to a whole lot of folks, this is the most important matter in Utah sports these days.\n\nAnd as former Jazz player Greg Foster once so famously put it when talking about the team needing to hit the throttle hard when the NBA playoffs came around, back when the Jazz actually made the playoffs: \"It's nut-cutting time.\" That reference, I'm told, had nothing to do with castrating sheep or any other critters, or cutting the bolts off the sides of a ship's hull in the final stages of construction, and everything to do with collecting nuts at the end of the fall season, before the animals wandered off with them all or before they were buried in the first layer of winter ice.\n\nWhere were we?\n\nAh, yes, ice, and Utah's name for its team that skates on it. We've all bandied about a hundred ideas, thousands of them, some serious, some middling, some on the far edge of lunacy. Although the Utah Lunatics hasn't really shown up on any lists that I've seen. We'll do away with the goofiness now and get right down to the leading number of candidates, the ones that have been trademarked recently by a certain power center, for what the durn name should be.\n\nUtah Ice -- Utah might be the winter sports capital of the world, or at least of the United States, and while Ice has a nice frigid feel to it, it's too redundant. The team skates on ice, so naming the team after the surface upon which it plays seems a bit redundant. It'd be like naming a football team \"Turf\" or \"Gridiron,\" or a basketball team \"Hardwood,\" or a baseball team \"Diamond.\" Nobody would do that because it just doesn't work.\n\nUtah Yetis -- This seems to be a popular one, but there are just a couple of hangups. The first is, this was once the mascot's name for the Colorado Avalanche, and that's a no-go. Second, if my research is correct, Yeti refers to the hairy mountain beast that hangs out in the Himalayas, better known in this country as an Abominable Snowman. What exactly does a legend from Tibet have to do with the Beehive State? Nothing.\n\nUtah Outlaws -- Granted, that's a tough name and the possibilities for a logo might be pretty darn cool. But does Utah's hockey team really want to be named after criminals? People known for ignoring and breaking the rule of law? You might as well name the team the Politicians.\n\nUtah Venom -- Yes, there are seven different kinds of rattlesnakes living in the state, and that scares the bejeebers out of me when I go for a hike in the mountains with the family dog or even for a walk around the block. Saw a dead rattler in the middle of a neighborhood road just last summer. Saw two on a freaking golf course. They say you can have your dog trained to avoid getting bit, but if people struggle to stay away from such poisonous serpents, not sure how Rags and Fido, even if trained, would safely react. Does Utah really want the image of a snake on its hockey team, on its team gear -- flags, pennants, blankets, T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, pajamas? Who wants your sleep or your kids' sleep disrupted by night terrors on account of images of sidewinders slithering all over your face after hockey games? Not me.\n\nUtah Fury -- What are Utahns furious about? Looked up the strict definition of fury and it read: \"Intense, disordered, and often destructive rage.\" Really, is that what we want? Secondary meanings were: \"any of the avenging deities in Greek mythology who torment criminals\" -- oh, like Outlaws? -- \"and inflict plagues.\" We've had enough plagues around here lately. Nobody wants to stir images of, say, the Utah COVID. Also: \"an avenging spirit, especially a spiteful woman\" -- c'mon, folks, we're better than that -- or \"extreme fierceness or violence.\" How about the Utah Brutality or the Utah Slaughterers. No and no.\n\nUtah Mammoth -- It's awkward and clumsy. An extinct hairy elephant.\n\nUtah Hockey Club or Utah HC -- This hammers the idea that nobody in Utah is smart or creative enough to come up with a real name. That doesn't make the state look unique, it makes it look dumb, like the pioneers -- and subsequently their offspring -- ran out of ideas as they crossed the plains to get here.\n\nUtah Blizzard -- I understand that this ties in with the idea of snow, something we need in order to, you know, live and survive around here, water being the wellspring of life in the desert and all, regardless of how inconvenient it can be for driving conditions from November to May, and it perpetuates the double-Z theme initiated with the Jazz -- call 'em the Blizz -- and that could be a good thing or a bad. Still haven't been able to fully embrace the idea of another team name that a) goes all in on the kitsch of the two Z's, and b) is in the singular, not the plural. I'll take Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh, my, over the Heat and the Thunder and, yes, the Jazz.\n\nUtah Fill-In-the-Blanks -- Since we still don't know what the name will really end up being, and since the names that have been trademarked might yet be a bit of a ruse, guess and guess quickly because you know what time it is? Yeah, you do ... it's time to collect all the nuts. The Utah Nuts?

Many also have some sort of connection to Utah's winter sports scene, which seems like an appropriate choice for the new hockey team.\n\nStill, there are some terms within the list with which all might not be familiar.\n\nNHL MOCK DRAFT: Sharks land Macklin Celebrini after winning 2024 draft lottery\n\nA squall has several different definitions, according to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.

A study from the university revealed Utah women's biggest perceived challenges. (Photo by raclro via Getty Images)\n\nLack of recognition, sexism, bias, discrimination, gendered expectations, economic insecurity and a deeply ingrained religious culture are among Utah women's biggest perceived challenges, a survey from Utah State University's Utah Women and Leadership Project found.\n\nThe major challenge, according to 42% of respondents of a perceived challenge survey, is a lack of recognition for women and girls' skills, talents and expertise. The study received comments expressing the perception that women are often not viewed as equals with men in the state and are also seen as being in a lower status.\n\n\"Women and girls from a very early age are taught in this state that their very existence is substandard to men,\" one of the commenters wrote.\n\nOthers shared that sentiment, adding there is gender bias in the state and beliefs that reinforce gender stereotypes.\n\n\"Until we are seen as equal partners in the home, at work, and on the steps of the legislature, change will be slow and arduous,\" another respondent said.\n\nThe survey was conducted in the fall of 2023 with over 3,500 participants, including 2,433 who offered more detailed thoughts on the greatest challenges women and girls face in Utah.\n\nUtah women and girls are not thriving in critical areas, according to the Utah Women and Leadership Project study. The Beehive state continues to have high levels of domestic violence, sexual assault, child sexual abuse and gender-based discrimination, the study reads, citing Utah State University research exploring the status of women and girls in the state.\n\n\"Utah also is ranked as the worst state for women's equality and has low levels of women's leadership representation in nearly all domains, including politics and business,\" the study reads. \"Although the needle has moved slightly in a few areas, the current trajectory will require three to four more decades to make notable progress.\"\n\nAbout 42% of respondents said that gendered expectations were a common challenge. There's social pressure for women to have a \"sense of duty to their families or religion to do what men say and to succumb to male domination,\" according to the study. \"Some participants referenced the 'purity culture' within the state.\"\n\nMany women are raised to marry young and raise children while their husband works, a respondent commented. Those expectations lead to economic repercussions and financial dependence.\n\n\"I believe the greatest challenges for women and girls in Utah is lack of preparedness to be self-sustaining. Women often marry and sacrifice education to be a mother, which is noble, but leaves them unprepared in the event of financial hardship through illness, death, or divorce,\" one respondent wrote.\n\nOther top challenges include religious influence where gender role expectations are linked with religious beliefs or practices -- which 27% of respondents shared -- balancing career and home -- mentioned by 25% of respondents -- and work-related inequities -- an issue reported by 23% of the study participants.\n\nAlmost 18% reported difficulty with self-worth, and about 15% said lack of support, opportunities, education or training were challenges.\n\nAlmost 15% of participants also described concerns about experiencing abuse, assault and harassment. Additionally, about 13% worry about medical and health resources -- including reproductive health care and mental health -- and 11% consider a lack of women in leadership a notable issue.\n\nBesides those larger shared concerns, others worry these issues may present more hardship in a changing economy.\n\n\"Housing affordability may force women into the workforce in higher percentages than ever before, and I'm not sure workplace readiness is keeping up with the percentage needing to work full time, so many will be trying to contribute to household income with limited skills/education,\" a commenter wrote.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender role"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Logan, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-esteem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Organizations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/utah_news_dispatch_articles_862/d6d87c2e3002a93c240984fd3ca42644", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546326", "eventUri": "eng-9546326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

What should be done?", "body": "A forum on election trust takes place at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah on Tuesday, May 7, 2024. (Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)\n\nOnly 40% of Republicans are very or somewhat confident in the accuracy of U.S. elections -- down from a peak of nearly 90% in 2006. Meanwhile 80% of Democrats and 67% of independent voters say they have confidence in U.S. elections.\n\nThat's according to a poll of 2,012 Americans conducted by Gallup and Johns Hopkins University's Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute in October.\n\nEven Utah -- a red state that adopted voting by mail well before COVID-19 and where polls historically have shown Utahns have high confidence in their local elections -- isn't immune to that trend, at least when it comes to presidential elections.\n\nConsider these results from a new poll conducted by Gallup of 502 Utah adults between March 13 and March 22. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.83 percentage points:\n\nThat Gallup poll was conducted as part of a partnership with the center-right think tank R Street and Johns Hopkins University's Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute, which has been traveling across the U.S. to bring together election officials, scholars and others to build trust in elections.\n\nResults of a poll conducted by Gallup for R Street and Johns Hopkins University's Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute. The poll was of 502 Utah adults between March 13 and March 22, 2024. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.83 percentage points.\n\nThe Utah poll results were unveiled Tuesday during an \"election trust forum\" held at Utah Valley University and hosted by the Gary R. Herbert Institute of Public Policy, the SNF Agora Institute, and the Sutherland Institute, a conservative public policy think tank based in Salt Lake City.\n\nConcerns about those national and local poll results were at the forefront of the forum's three hours of panel discussions, which convened the state's top election officials and academic scholars to explore how to fix a problem they worried could spell trouble for the future of U.S. democracy if left unaddressed.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson and former Utah Gov. Gary Herbert both shared recorded video messages to kick off Tuesday's discussions, urging everyone to work together to increase trust.\n\n\"Voter access and ballot security are paramount, especially in the age of some saying elections are illegitimate or have been stolen,\" Herbert said. \"Unfortunately this has become an all too common feature of campaigns, and it undermines our system of self government.\"\n\nHowever, while moderating the first panel discussion Justin Jones, executive director of the Herbert institute, pointed to a December press release in which several top election officials, all Republicans, asserted growing distrust in elections was a \"bipartisan problem\" thanks to a \"toxic stew of disinformation, misinformation and deliberate lies for profit or political advantage.\"\n\n\"Both parties have helped weaken trust in our electoral system. Both must help restore it,\" states the release, which was issued by Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane along with Henderson, Kentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab.\n\n\"As conservatives, we recognize the damage caused by the drumbeat of falsehoods repeated about the 2020 elections,\" the joint statement said, not naming Trump but noting that even though the 2022 elections were \"largely undisputed and noncontroversial, there are still many voters who don't believe they can have confidence in the 2024 elections.\"\n\n\"This is a bipartisan problem, though. Democrats have also sown doubt about high-profile election results in 2000, 2004, 2016, and 2018,\" the statement said.\n\nIt included links to a 2012 New York Magazine commentary piece titled \"Yes, Bush v. Gore Did Steal the Election,\" a 2005 CNN story that reported a group of Democrats in Congress were challenging the counting of Ohio's electoral votes, a 2019 Washington Post article quoting Hillary Clinton saying Trump was an \"illegitimate president,\" and a 2021 CNN story about Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams defending herself from criticism that she never conceded her 2018 loss to Gov. Brian Kemp due to voter suppression allegations.\n\n\"While Republicans acknowledge our responsibility,\" the Republican election officials wrote, \"it will take both parties to break the cycle and restore voter trust.\"\n\nMcGrane came to Utah from Idaho to participate in Tuesday's discussion. When asked why, then, polls have been showing election distrust is more prominent among conservatives than it is among other political partisans, McGrane said it all depends on who won (or lost) at the time.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson shared a video recorded message to attendees at a forum on election trust at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah on May 7, 2024. (Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)\n\n\"The seeding of distrust has actually been bipartisan in our country, it's just come at different points in time,\" McGrane said, adding that includes \"calling for the removal of the electoral college because the popular vote had more people.\"\n\nToday, though, in the wake of Trump's 2020 loss, the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and now as Trump continues to sow doubt heading into the 2024 election, distrust in national U.S. elections among conservatives is reaching a concerning inflection point.\n\n\"We need to rally together and run our campaigns better,\" McGrane said. \"Better candidates. Better efforts. And that's where a lot of the focus needs to be, not on challenging the process itself.\"\n\nDuring his video recorded speech Tuesday, Herbert said \"election integrity\" was the first issue he asked the team at Utah Valley University's institute named after him to study, and he pointed to several research papers that have since been published on the topic.\n\nOne of those papers detailed a review of Utah's election laws and procedures, and the Herbert Institute researchers concluded Utah's current election processes \"make it highly unlikely that any appreciable level of election fraud could go undetected.\"\n\nHerbert said he and the Herbert Institute will continue to research and host forums on election integrity, \"and we will continue to do so until we have worked to restore confidence in our elections process in our state, and in America.\"\n\nTo advance that goal, Herbert encouraged attendees at Tuesday's forum to adopt the \"conservative principles for building trust in elections\" that the SNF Agora Institute and R Street created after holding off-the-record meetings last year in Washington, D.C., Utah, Indiana and Texas with election officials, advocates and democracy scholars to \"explore the contours of a pro-democracy movement for conservatives.\"\n\nThose conversations helped form the following principles meant to increase confidence in elections. They are:\n\n\"No system is perfect,\" Herbert said, \"but in Utah we not only do it well, but we're also one of the best in the nation.\"\n\nLike Herbert, Henderson also urged politicians to avoid casting doubt on elections through partisan rhetoric.\n\n\"Public discussions about how we elect our representatives should rise above polarized partisan talking points and be guided by sound principles and sound evidence,\" Henderson said.\n\nHenderson asserted Utah \"leads the nation in elections administration by protecting voters' constitutional right to the ballot in ways that reduce barriers, while also strengthening security measures to ensure each Utahn knows that their vote is counted securely, accurately and anonymously.\"\n\nUtah currently mails ballots to all active registered voters. The state began slowly implementing mail-in ballots starting back in 2012 to increase voter convenience and turnout, and didn't see the same drama around voting by mail like in other states that had to hurriedly implement it in 2020 amid the pandemic.\n\nThere have been some legislative efforts in recent years to restrict Utah's voting by mail system, with some Republicans wanting voters to have to request mail-in ballots rather than having them sent automatically, but they've been in the minority even among conservatives. This year, Utah's Republican-controlled Legislature rejected attempts to curb or alter voting by mail in Utah.\n\nHenderson said Utah's current vote by mail system \"contains more than 20 unique layers of security at the state and local levels, protecting against broad-based voter fraud or any attempts to affect the process improperly.\"\n\n\"As we move into the 2024 election, it's essential for all of us to continue to promote Utah's strong track record of election integrity while we strive to continue to improve (the system) so citizens can continue to have high levels of trust,\" she said.\n\nHenderson added it's important to remember elections are conducted locally -- not nationally -- and she encouraged everyone in the room to \"be a champion of our election system.\"\n\n\"Encourage every voter you interact with to educate themselves about the process and cast an informed vote,\" she said. \"I encourage everyone who has questions about how Utah's elections are done to visit their local county clerk or volunteer as an election worker.\"\n\nSome people who came to Tuesday's forum -- a couple of them identifying themselves as Republican delegates -- visibly scoffed or bristled at comments that Utah's election system should be lauded.\n\nOne man, Aaron Ritchey, a Republican delegate from Logan, raised his hand toward the end of the discussion and said, \"I think a lot of the issue is where ballots are going,\" leading him to ask, \"is it more important to have quantity of voters or is it more important to have a quality voter?\"\n\n\"That's a big philosophical question,\" said Josh Daniels, former Utah County clerk who was presenting about a new nonprofit called Trust Utah Elections, meant to create a platform that promotes election \"transparency, shares vital election information, and builds a coalition of individuals and organizations dedicated to the principles of fair and secure elections,\" according to its website.\n\nJosh Daniels, former Utah County clerk and co-founder a new nonprofit called Trust Utah Elections, speaks during a forum on election trust at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, on May 7, 2024. (Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)\n\n\"Fundamentally,\" Daniels told Ritchey, \"our country is founded on this idea of self-government, right? The people -- which is all people -- are governed by this government entity, and for self government to really matter we all have a responsibility to participate. And a big part of how we do that is through voting. But yeah, good philosophical question.\"\n\n\"It's individual responsibility,\" Ritchey said, \"not the responsibility of the government to make sure everybody votes.\"\n\nRitchey's question stabbed at a long-debated issue that has divided voters even within the Utah GOP -- and one that leads some to favor the caucus/convention system, arguing delegates are more informed and can best make decisions for their neighbors.\n\nWhile the convention system's critics say it attracts the party's most extreme and is not representative of most Republican voters, its supporters, including Ritchey, argue it gives an opportunity to candidates who might not have the money or resources to gather signatures to qualify for the ballot under Utah's alternative path to the primary thanks to a 2014 law, SB54.\n\nRitchey's question was also a dig at voting by mail. He told Utah News Dispatch he believes Utah is going too far by automatically sending by-mail ballots to all active registered voters. He prefers voting in person, and said he believes Utahns who want to vote by mail should have to request them yearly.\n\n\"If it's important to people, they'll vote. If it isn't important, they won't,\" Richey said, questioning the security of voting by mail.\n\nHowever, most Utahns continue to trust Utah's local elections and have favorable opinions of voting by mail, according to another poll.\n\nA Sutherland Institute poll conducted by Y2 Analytics in February found over 70% of the Utah poll respondents are confident that Utah's by-mail ballots are counted accurately, and that voting by mail elections are fair and secure.\n\nThe poll was conducted of 657 likely 2024 general election Utah voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nIn a 2022 report titled \"Examining the Evidence on Vote by Mail,\" Derek Monson with the Sutherland Institute wrote ever since the 2020 presidential election, voting by mail has faced \"criticism out of concern over election security and integrity,\" and yet \"the evidence for this criticism often boils down to anecdotes and hypotheticals.\"\n\nHe reported voting by mail is \"not associated with significant, widespread levels of voter fraud.\" Utah's voting by mail system, he wrote, has \"many layers of security,\" which includes voter registration processes to continually update the state's voter rolls, and controls to ensure secure ballot processing, including signature verification and unique barcodes to prevent duplicate votes, among other measures.\n\nA Sutherland Institute poll conducted by Y2 Analytics in February of 657 likely 2024 general election Utah voters. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.\n\nMonson also wrote voting by mail has long been in use in various forms since at least the Civil War, and historically political parties have switched between supporting or opposing voting by mail \"based, it seems, on electoral considerations.\"\n\n\"For instance,\" he wrote, \"the most straightforward historical explanation of a partisan's position on (voting by mail) comes down to which political party's presidential candidate is perceived as benefiting the most from voting by mail,\" he wrote.\n\nEven today, the Republican Party is finding itself in a dilemma when it comes to voting by mail.\n\nTrump recently changed his tune against voting by mail and urged his supporters to use absentee voting -- along with early voting and other forms of voting to increase turnout. The move came after senior advisers have been encouraging him to embrace votes \"no matter how they come,\" CBS News reported.\n\nAnd yet, while Republicans are trying to push their voters to embrace voting by mail, they're hitting resistance in wake of Trump's repeated attacks, NBC News reported.\n\nWhile Tuesday's forum discussed solutions to increase trust in Utah's election system, experts and academics urged election officials to avoid drastic changes that could result in confusion or chaos, because stability and uniformity help most people feel secure.\n\nInstead, they discussed finding ways to more broadly educate anyone with fears or questions to learn about the existing safeguards in place while staying open to suggestions to fine tune security.\n\n\"This is a difficult time to be in this line of work for a whole host of reasons,\" Scott Warren, a fellow at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said during the forum's closing remarks. \"But what was so great about this convening today, is it's about the process. Fundamentally, it's not about who wins and loses, but about how we make sure the process works.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It's an achievement that surely deserves celebration -- preferably with a toast of 3.2% beer, in true Utah fashion, given the state's famously tight grip on alcohol laws. After all, nothing quite says \"congratulations\" like a beverage that gently tickles rather than intoxicates.\n\nBefore we dive into the more sober details of why Utah's ranked first, it's worth acknowledging the elephant in the room -- an elephant-wearing pioneer garb and possibly juggling multiple wedding rings. Yes, polygamy. While it's a part of Utah's historical fabric, much like Brigham Young and the Salt Lake Temple, modern-day Utah is less about sister wives and more about silicon slopes and stellar education systems. But, hey, it makes for some spicy history lessons and the occasional quirky headline, right?\n\nUtah isn't just a pretty face with breathtaking landscapes and ski-worthy snow. Oh no, it's also brainy, boasting top rankings in education and coming in second in healthcare. The state shines like the North Star for businesses, thanks to its vibrant economy and infrastructure, making it a beacon for tech companies and startups looking for a place to call home.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Despite its rules around drinking that might leave out-of-towners scratching their heads (ever heard of a \"Zion Curtain\"?), Utah knows how to keep its residents happy and healthy. That's evident in its commendable healthcare system and an environment that encourages active lifestyles, from hiking up those red rocks to shredding down powdery slopes.", "source": {"uri": "kidotalkradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIDO Talk Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_matthews@kidotalkradio.com", "name": "Kyle Matthews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_&_World_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. News & World Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polygamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brigham Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wedding ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elephant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zion", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zion"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polaris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landscape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hiking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Camps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/657/files/2024/05/attachment-1.-San-Bernardino-California-7.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546326", "eventUri": "eng-9546326", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

In a new report published on Wednesday, the Public Accounts Committee warned that there have been claims those waiting are at risk of self-harm and suicide. The report said: \u201cThese people remain in limbo. Some people have now been waiting for over a year to be told what will happen to them. \u201cMany of them are living in temporary home office accommodation, where there have been numerous reports of self-harm and suicide.\u201d It notes that the home office is responsible for the safety and wellbeing of all the people in its care whether they are claiming asylum or about to be relocated. The home office told the committee it undertakes screening to check suitability for room-sharing and has a signposting system for if tensions arise between waiting asylum seekers \u2013 but it did not provide any further details. There is reportedly a migrant helpline for all asylum seekers, and the National Audit Office says room-sharing is primarily based around those who speak the same language. The MPs\u2019 report added: \u201cThere have been 283 incidents linked to self-harm and suicide which could in part be attributed to the home office\u2019s sharing policy.\u201d The committee called on the home office to explain how it is looking after the welfare of those people before the end of July. On the wider effectiveness of the Rwanda scheme, the report said the MPs had \u201clittle confidence\u201d. It said: \u201cWe are concerned that the home office does not have a credible plan for implementing the Rwanda partnership.\u201d The committee said cutting back on hotel use \u201cdrove up rental costs, increased homelessness and put unacceptable pressure on local councils\u201d. It even went on to question how the home office evaluates whether the policy is a success, saying it should explain how it intends to assess value for money. The committee asked for all the costings and impacts of the Rwanda plan \u201cno later than one month after the publication of this report\u201d \u2013 meaning it would come out before the general election on July 4. In fact, the report suggests the costly errors in setting up the scheme may have cost the taxpayer \u00a346million more than if the home office had just stayed with hotels instead. The MPs questioned the home office\u2019s reluctance to offer more granular details too, including any specifics around potential deals with other countries. And , though there are more than 50,000 people who are deemed to be in the UK illegally, the government has ben unable to say how many it will actually be able to relocate.", "summary": "<div><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66572a7a2400005100a286cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" alt=\"Migrants are brought ashore after being picked up in the English Channel by a Border Force vessel on November 16, 2023 in Dover, United Kingdom.\" data-caption=\"Migrants are brought ashore after being picked up in the English Channel by a Border Force vessel on November 16, 2023 in Dover, United Kingdom.\" data-credit-link-back=\"\" data-credit=\"Dan Kitwood via Getty Images\" />Migrants are brought ashore after being picked up in the English Channel by a Border Force vessel on November 16, 2023 in Dover, United Kingdom.</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>A crossbench committee of MPs has raised alarm bells over the <a href=\"news/rwanda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rwanda</a> scheme and the welfare of the asylum seekers currently \u201cin limbo\u201d in the UK.</p><p><a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5804/cmselect/cmpubacc/639/report.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener ", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mps-report-slams-impact-rwanda-plan-has-on-asylum-seekers-in-limbo_uk_665719e0e4b0169dc758d5fd", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66572a7a2400005100a286cd.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:36:07", "author": "Kate Nicholson", "authors": ["Kate Nicholson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.27}

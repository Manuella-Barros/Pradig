Bailey is calling on the Supreme Court to invoke its original jurisdiction under Article III, Section II of the Constitution to settle the legal battle between the two states, according to a press release.\n\n\"We're going to continue to fight against lawfare in all of its forms, not only by entering and filing briefs in the other illicit witch hunt prosecutions of President Trump, but also fighting to expose and make transparent the collusion between Biden's Department of Justice and the illicit witch hunt prosecutions at the state level, and fighting censorship and the silencing of not only President Trump's voice but of listeners in Missouri,\" Bailey told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nTrump was convicted on 34 accounts of falsification of business records stemming from a nondisclosure agreement with porn star Stormy Daniels. The Manhattan jury consisting of seven men and five women indicted Trump after almost 12 hours of deliberations. (RELATED: 'A Win For President Trump': Jonathan Turley Says Supreme Court Immunity Ruling Is Blow To Jack Smith)\n\nBailey hinted on June 20 that he would sue the State of New York for the attack on the democratic process through unconstitutional lawfare against former President Donald Trump, according to his statement on X.\n\n\"Trump's conviction is very likely to be overturned on appeal. But by then, the constraints New York has sought to impose on Trump to limit his ability to campaign will already have had their full effect. Missouri has a strong, judicially enforceable interest in its citizens and electors being able to hear Trump's campaigning free from any gag order or other interference imposed by the State of New York,\" Bailey stated in the suit.\n\nBailey filed a motion of preliminary injunction, asking the court to immediately halt any further action in the New York case until after the American people have had their say at the ballot box, according to the press release.\n\n\"Missourians are deeply concerned about the direction of this nation. In Missouri, we love freedom and we love the rights that are given to God and protected by the United States Constitution. We believe that the government exists to protect our rights, and so when we see the government weaponized against an individual to take those rights away, it is an affront to who we are as a people,\" Bailey told the DCNF.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It comes just one month after New York's Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, won a guilty verdict against Trump.\n\nTrump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years.

Bragg was previously involved in civil litigation against the former President while working for the New York Attorney General's Office and then campaigned for his current position by promising to use that experience to prosecute him. Additionally, Bragg hired the third highest ranking member from Biden's Department of Justice, Matthew Colangelo, to lead the prosecution against Biden's political opponent.\n\nHis lawsuit also notes how Judge Merchan violated state judicial ethics rules by donating to the Biden campaign. Further, Judge Merchan refused to recuse himself from the case despite having donated to Trump's general-election opponent and having a close family member who stood to gain financially from a conviction. He later imposed a gag order on President Trump when he pointed these facts out to the public.\n\nNoting this reprehensible lawfare, General Bailey states in the lawsuit, \"Trump's conviction is very likely to be overturned on appeal.

But by then, the constraints New York has sought to impose on Trump to limit his ability to campaign will already have had their full effect. Missouri has a strong, judicially enforceable interest in its citizens and electors being able to hear Trump's campaigning free from any gag order or other interference imposed by the State of New York.\"", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debra_heine@amgreatness.com", "name": "Debra Heine", "type": "author",

Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Trump faces a maximum sentence of 136 years.\n\n\"This lawfare is poisonous to American democracy. The American people ought to be able to participate in a presidential election free from New York's interference. Any gag order and sentence should be stayed until after the election,\" Bailey said.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bailey lays out the timeline of how Bragg brought charges against Trump, alleging he did it to boost President Biden's campaign and keep Trump out of the White House.\n\nBailey noted Bragg was previously involved in a lawsuit against Trump while working for the New York Attorney General's Office and then campaigned for his current position by promising to use that experience to prosecute Trump.\n\nBRAGG DOES 'NOT OPPOSE' TRUMP REQUEST TO DELAY SENTENCING; AWAITS JUDGE MERCHAN'S APPROVAL\n\nAdditionally, Bailey pointed out that Bragg hired the third highest-ranking member from Biden's Department of Justice, Matthew Colangelo, to lead the prosecution against Biden's political opponent.\n\nHis lawsuit also alleges Judge Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing Trump's New York criminal trial, violated state judicial ethics rules by donating to the Biden campaign.\n\nBailey called it \"reprehensible lawfare\" against the former president.\n\nBailey filed a motion of preliminary injunction, asking the court to immediately halt any further action in the New York case until after the American people have had their say at the ballot box.\n\n\"Radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election. We have to stand up and fight back,\" Bailey previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.\n\nTrump on Monday moved to overturn his criminal conviction in the Manhattan case after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a former president has substantial immunity for official acts committed while in office. He also requested to delay his sentencing, which was scheduled for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention, where he will be formally named as the 2024 GOP presidential nominee.\n\nBragg said Trump's request to toss the verdict was without merit, but he did not oppose the request to delay sentencing.\n\nMerchan on Tuesday afternoon delayed Trump's sentencing date to September 18 at 10 a.m.\n\nFox News Digital's Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bailey is calling on the Supreme Court to step in and rule that New York's restrictions on Trump's ability to campaign interfered with the election.\n\nThe suit specifically alleges that \"New York's actions impose a sovereign harm to the ability of Missouri's 10 electors to exercise their federal authority,\" with Bailey telling The Daily Wire that it is \"intended to protect Missourians' sovereign interest in participating in a national presidential election on equal footing with other states.\"\n\nBailey referenced Purcell, a federal case he described as the court deciding that \"the judiciary should refrain from issuing rulings close in times of an election that could interfere with an election.\"\n\n\"There's these open questions as to whether or not President Trump can appear on a ballot\" and \"whether or not he's eligible to run for public office,\" Bailey stated, adding that uncertainty has \"been injected by this rogue prosecutor,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, in a manner that \"violates the doctrine of Purcell and has the potential to undermine the credibility of the election.\"\n\nHe also addressed the gag order Judge Juan Merchan, the Acting Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, placed on Trump, arguing that the order and any sentencing \"should be stayed until after the election.\"\n\n\"Trump's conviction is very likely to be overturned on appeal. But by then, the constraints New York has sought to impose on Trump to limit his ability to campaign will already have had their full effect,\" Bailey explained. \"Missouri has a strong, judicially enforceable interest in its citizens and electors being able to hear Trump's campaigning free from any gag order.\"\n\n\"We used to live in a world where the rules of the game mattered about the players and the outcomes,\" Bailey told The Daily Wire, addressing the broader consequences of the prosecution of Trump for American politics. \"The Left has rejected that approach in favor of violating the rules in order to retain power because they're so desperate to be in control and have authority, and they're willing to sacrifice the rest of our rights on that altar.\"", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gag order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/07/Untitled-design-3-e1720017090438.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704225", "eventUri": "eng-9704225", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own merit, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,\" said Bailey.\n\nMISSOURI AG TO SUE NEW YORK OVER 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAWFARE' AGAINST TRUMP: 'TIME TO RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW'\n\n\"I will not sit idly by while Soros-backed prosecutors hold Missouri voters hostage in this presidential election. I am filing suit to ensure every Missourian can exercise their right to hear from and vote for their preferred presidential candidate.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe lawsuit alleges three specific violations, including interference with the presidential election in other states, violation of the First Amendment and the unlawful change of election rules in the months leading up to an election. It comes just one month after New York's Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, won a guilty verdict against Trump.\n\nGOP AG LAUNCHES NEW PROBE INTO COMMUNICATIONS FROM DOJ AND TRUMP PROSECUTORS\n\nTrump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Trump pleaded not guilty to all counts. Each count carries a maximum prison sentence of four years. Trump faces a maximum sentence of 136 years.\n\n\"This lawfare is poisonous to American democracy. The American people ought to be able to participate in a presidential election free from New York's interference. Any gag order and sentence should be stayed until after the election,\" Bailey said.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bailey lays out the timeline of how Bragg brought charges against Trump, alleging he did it to boost President Biden's campaign and keep Trump out of the White House.\n\nBailey noted Bragg was previously involved in a lawsuit against Trump while working for the New York Attorney General's Office and then campaigned for his current position by promising to use that experience to prosecute Trump.\n\nBRAGG DOES 'NOT OPPOSE' TRUMP REQUEST TO DELAY SENTENCING; AWAITS JUDGE MERCHAN'S APPROVAL\n\nAdditionally, Bailey pointed out that Bragg hired the third highest-ranking member from Biden's Department of Justice, Matthew Colangelo, to lead the prosecution against Biden's political opponent.\n\nHis lawsuit also alleges Judge Juan Merchan, the judge overseeing Trump's New York criminal trial, violated state judicial ethics rules by donating to the Biden campaign.\n\nBailey called it \"reprehensible lawfare\" against the former president.\n\nBailey filed a motion of preliminary injunction, asking the court to immediately halt any further action in the New York case until after the American people have had their say at the ballot box.\n\n\"Radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election. We have to stand up and fight back,\" Bailey previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.\n\nTrump on Monday moved to overturn his criminal conviction in the Manhattan case after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a former president has substantial immunity for official acts committed while in office. He also requested to delay his sentencing, which was scheduled for July 11, just days before the Republican National Convention, where he will be formally named as the 2024 GOP presidential nominee.\n\nBragg said Trump's request to toss the verdict was without merit, but he did not oppose the request to delay sentencing.\n\nMerchan on Tuesday afternoon delayed Trump's sentencing date to September 18 at 10 a.m.\n\nFox News Digital's Brooke Singman contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source: Missouri AG sues New York over 'reprehensible lawfare' against Trump: 'Poisonous to

Bailey goes further, claiming that sentencing Trump before the election would interfere with his ability to campaign for president.\n\n\"Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own merits, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,\" Bailey said in a statement.\n\nBailey and Scharf, a former federal prosecutor, have both taken aggressive steps to align themselves with Trump and cast themselves as the best defender of the former president. The race has increasingly centered on Trump as the legal developments surrounding the former president have accelerated in recent weeks.\n\nScharf declined to comment on Bailey's filing.\n\nElad Gross, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said in a statement that Bailey was \"desperate for attention.\"\n\n\"It's sad to see our money repeatedly flushed down the toilet while Andrew Bailey can't manage the basic functions of his office to sue scammers, protect families, and stop wasteful spending,\" said Gross, a St. Louis civil rights attorney.\n\nBailey's legal filing alleges that the state of New York violated federal laws in its prosecution and conviction of the former president. The 99-page filing includes a summary of the prosecution of Trump and echoes arguments from Republicans who have cast the charges as an attempt by the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden to weaken Trump's bid for president.\n\n\"The American people ought to be able to participate in a presidential election free from New York's interference,\" Bailey wrote in the filing. \"Any gag order and sentence should be stayed until after the election.\"\n\nChuck Hatfield, a Jefferson City-based attorney who previously worked in the attorney general's office, said the likelihood of the Supreme Court granting Bailey's motion was close to nothing. He pointed to the fact that Bailey's office also did not file a motion to expedite the case.\n\n\"I would question whether this is a serious effort to litigate the matter or whether this is just a press release styled as a lawsuit,\" he said.\n\nMark Johnson, a Kansas City attorney who has worked on election issues, said in an interview that Bailey and Missouri do not have legal standing to bring the filing.\n\n\"The allegations in these pleadings are woefully deficient ... to assert jurisdiction before the Supreme Court,\" he said. \"The same would be true if he had filed them in a trial court. If you don't have standing you don't have standing, period.\"\n\nRod Chapel, the president of the Missouri NAACP, said on Wednesday that the filing was \"all political.\"\n\n\"The number one question that is raised in my mind, aside from the moral impact and the misuse of government resources, is how is it that we're able to justify reaching outside the confines of Missouri's borders when there's so much injustice happening within the state?\" he said.\n\nTrump's grip on statewide politics is perhaps most visible in the Republican contest for Missouri attorney general. Very little separates Scharf and Bailey on policy, and both have tried to outmaneuver each other in their support for the former president.\n\nScharf has defended Trump in court and numerous TV show interviews, while Bailey has used his office to file briefs in support of the former president. In May, Bailey sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice demanding documents related to the prosecutions of Trump.\n\n--------\n\n(The Star's Katie Moore contributed reporting.)\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 The Kansas City Star.

Bailey goes further, claiming that sentencing Trump before the election would interfere with his ability to campaign for president.\n\n\"Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own merits, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,\" Bailey said in a statement.\n\nBailey and Scharf, a former federal prosecutor, have both taken aggressive steps to align themselves with Trump and cast themselves as the best defender of the former president. The race has increasingly centered on Trump as the legal developments surrounding the former president have accelerated in recent weeks.\n\nScharf declined to comment on Bailey's filing.\n\nElad Gross, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said in a statement that Bailey was \"desperate for attention.\"\n\n\"It's sad to see our money repeatedly flushed down the toilet while Andrew Bailey can't manage the basic functions of his office to sue scammers, protect families, and stop wasteful spending,\" said Gross, a St. Louis civil rights attorney.\n\nBailey's legal filing alleges that the state of New York violated federal laws in its prosecution and conviction of the former president. The 99-page filing includes a summary of the prosecution of Trump and echoes arguments from Republicans who have cast the charges as an attempt by the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden to weaken Trump's bid for president.\n\n\"The American people ought to be able to participate in a presidential election free from New York's interference,\" Bailey wrote in the filing. \"Any gag order and sentence should be stayed until after the election.\"\n\nChuck Hatfield, a Jefferson City-based attorney who previously worked in the attorney general's office, said the likelihood of the Supreme Court granting Bailey's motion was close to nothing. He pointed to the fact that Bailey's office also did not file a motion to expedite the case.\n\n\"I would question whether this is a serious effort to litigate the matter or whether this is just a press release styled as a lawsuit,\" he said.\n\nMark Johnson, a Kansas City attorney who has worked on election issues, said in an interview that Bailey and Missouri do not have legal standing to bring the filing.\n\n\"The allegations in these pleadings are woefully deficient ... to assert jurisdiction before the Supreme Court,\" he said. \"The same would be true if he had filed them in a trial court. If you don't have standing you don't have standing, period.\"\n\nRod Chapel, the president of the Missouri NAACP, said on Wednesday that the filing was \"all political.\"\n\n\"The number one question that is raised in my mind, aside from the moral impact and the misuse of government resources, is how is it that we're able to justify reaching outside the confines of Missouri's borders when there's so much injustice happening within the state?\" he said.\n\nTrump's grip on statewide politics is perhaps most visible in the Republican contest for Missouri attorney general. Very little separates Scharf and Bailey on policy, and both have tried to outmaneuver each other in their support for the former president.\n\nScharf has defended Trump in court and numerous TV show interviews, while Bailey has used his office to file briefs in support of the former president. In May, Bailey sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice demanding documents related to the prosecutions of Trump.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Bailey is calling on the Supreme Court to step in and rule that New York's restrictions on Trump's ability to campaign interfered with the election.\n\nThe suit specifically alleges that \"New York's actions impose a sovereign harm to the ability of Missouri's 10 electors to exercise their federal authority,\" with Bailey telling The Daily Wire that it is \"intended to protect Missourians' sovereign interest in participating in a national presidential election on equal footing with other states.\"\n\nBailey referenced Purcell, a federal case he described as the court deciding that \"the judiciary should refrain from issuing rulings close in times of an election that could interfere with an election.\"\n\n\"There's these open questions as to whether or not President Trump can appear on a ballot\" and \"whether or not he's eligible to run for public office,\" Bailey stated, adding that uncertainty has \"been injected by this rogue prosecutor,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, in a manner that \"violates the doctrine of Purcell and has the potential to undermine the credibility of the election.\"\n\nHe also addressed the gag order Judge Juan Merchan, the Acting Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, placed on Trump, arguing that the order and any sentencing \"should be stayed until after the election.\"\n\n\"Trump's conviction is very likely to be overturned on appeal.

Bailey goes further, claiming that sentencing Trump before the election would interfere with his ability to campaign for president.\n\n\"Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own merits, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,\" Bailey said in a statement.\n\nBailey and Scharf, a former federal prosecutor, have both taken aggressive steps to align themselves with Trump and cast themselves as the best defender of the former president. The race has increasingly centered on Trump as the legal developments surrounding the former president have accelerated in recent weeks.\n\nScharf declined to comment on Bailey's filing.\n\nElad Gross, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said in a statement that Bailey was \"desperate for attention.\"\n\n\"It's sad to see our money repeatedly flushed down the toilet while Andrew Bailey can't manage the basic functions of his office to sue scammers, protect families, and stop wasteful spending,\" said Gross, a St. Louis civil rights attorney.\n\nBailey's legal filing alleges that the state of New York violated federal laws in its prosecution and conviction of the former president. The 99-page filing includes a summary of the prosecution of Trump and echoes arguments from Republicans who have cast the charges as an attempt by the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden to weaken Trump's bid for president.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/296/29641/2964188.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704225", "eventUri": "eng-9704225", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Trump during the 2024 Presidential election season so Missourians can participate in the election free from New York's exercise of coercive power limiting the ability of Trump to campaign,\" he writes, adding that \"This modest request imposes no harm on the State of New York, but it ensures that voters in Missouri and across America are able to make their voices heard this November without one State interfering with the ability of everybody else to hear a major-party candidate campaign.\"\n\nHas Trump been halted from campaigning? We have just endured ten days of endless stories about how vigorous and manly his lies were compared to sickly Biden's frail truths. Who exactly is being deprived of the right to listen to Donald Trump, the king of unearned media?\n\nThe so-called motion is a tour de force of public self-gratification, spewing right-wing talking points as if they were established facts.\n\n\"Bragg's criminal charges are only the latest example in an eight-year pattern of lawfare brought against Trump. A full account is far too lengthy to include here, so a brief snapshot is provided instead,\" he intones ominously, before waxing lyrical about John Durham, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Robert Mueller, Crossfire Hurricane, and of course Hunter Biden's laptop. Then he repeats the lies about the very prosecutor Trump has been barred from targeting, as well as Justice Merchan's daughter.\n\nHow could there possibly be standing for the Missouri attorney general to interfere in a prosecution by the District Attorney in Manhattan?\n\nWell, see ...\n\nMissouri's electors will be chosen by the people of Missouri through a popular vote. These millions of citizens have the same interest in hearing campaign speech, and Missourians have submitted 17 affidavits in this case (attached to the motion to expedite) explaining their interest in listening to Trump's speech in Missouri. Their interests are harmed by New York's exercising its coercive authority to limit Trump's ability to speak and travel.\n\nMissouri can sue on behalf of these individuals as parens patriae.\n\nFinally, New York's actions interfere with the associational rights of both electors and individual citizens of Missouri.\n\nWhat does that mean? Try eating a bucket of paint chips while watching Newsmax for 27 hours straight, and it'll all make perfect sense!\n\nThis isn't Andy Bailey's first performative lawstunt. We're talking about a guy who sued Media Matters ... a DC entity ... in Missouri state court ... for aggravated MEAN TO ELON ... and then seemed surprised that a federal judge might consider him to have acceded to personal jurisdiction by using a process server in DC to serve a subpoena on Media Matters.\n\nBailey really has outdone himself this time.

United States already wreaking havoc on Donald Trump's hush-money sentencing in New York, pushing the proceeding back at least until mid-September, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) followed through on a vow to sue the Empire State, begging the highest court in the land to hand the Show Me State \"modest\" relief until after the 2024 election.\n\nBailey is asking the justices to grant him leave to file a bill of complaint that looks to stay an already loosened gag order on Trump in the Manhattan case and to stay the former president's \"impending sentence\" for 34 felony falsification of business records convictions.\n\nThe AG's \"one modest request,\" as his filing describes it, is that a stay of \"any\" Trump sentence in the hush-money case must \"last until after the 2024 election.\"\n\n\"This modest request imposes no harm on the State of New York, but it ensures that voters in Missouri and across America are able to make their voices heard this November without one State interfering with the ability of everybody else to hear a major-party candidate campaign,\" the filing says, before citing a recent criticism that former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) made on HBO of Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg's (D) criminal case against Trump.\n\n\"If his name was not Donald Trump and if he wasn't running for president -- I'm the former AG of in New York -- I'm telling you that case would've never been brought,\" Cuomo said on Real Time with Bill Maher last week.\n\nCalling the hush-money case an act of \"lawfare\" that is \"poisonous to American democracy,\" Bailey again insisted that \"[a]ny gag order and sentence should be stayed until after the election,\" even if that sentence is probation.\n\n\"Any sentence, even probation, is likely to interfere with Trump's ability to freely campaign across the country,\" the attached bill of complaint said.\n\nIn order for Bailey to convince the Supreme Court to grant him leave to file his complaint, he will have to pass a three-part standing test:\n\n1) The plaintiff must have suffered an \"injury in fact,\" meaning that the injury is of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent\n\n2) There must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct brought before the court\n\n3) It must be likely, rather than speculative, that a favorable decision by the court will redress the injury\n\nThis is Missouri's claimed \"injury\":\n\nMissouri is injured by New York's attempt to use its coercive state power to interfere with the ability of Missouri electors to fulfill their federal function and of Missourians to receive relevant election-related information.\n\nIn a thread of posts on X, Bailey further stated that \"Right now, Missouri has a huge problem with New York\" and \"I will not sit idly by while Soros-backed prosecutors in New York hold Missouri voters hostage in this presidential election.\"\n\nGeorgetown University law professor and noted Supreme Court watcher Steve Vladeck reacted to the move by saying \"There's a 0.0% chance even *this* Court goes along with this nonsense,\" which was the general (and ultimately correct consensus) of legal experts when Texas AG Ken Paxton (R) asked for and did not receive leave to file his bill of complaint to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss.\n\nStill, we know that there are at least two justices who believe that the Supreme Court has no choice but to grant leave to file a bill of complaint in an original (state v. state) action at the high court: Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.\n\nWhen the high court rejected Paxton's gambit, Alito issued a statement that was joined by Thomas. That statement said: \"In my view, we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction.\"\n\nThomas and Alito said they wouldn't do anything more than that for Paxton, however.\n\n\"I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Supreme Court as a whole wrote that Texas was denied leave for \"lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution\" because it had \"not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\"\n\nVladeck expects the same end result in Bailey's case: denial of leave.\n\nBut at least one other SCOTUS expert is calling for a more severe smackdown.\n\n\"The Supreme Court should issue an order requiring @AGAndrewBailey and SG [Joshua] Divine to show cause why they should not be sanctioned for filing this

The state is also interfering with electors doing their jobs.\n\nRecounting the long years of Democratic lawfare against Trump, the motion asks SCOTUS to stop Trump's sentencing in September and lift the gag order that prevents him from speaking about the case.\n\nAnd, indeed, it cites no less an authority than former New York Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo to argue that Bragg never should have prosecuted the \"hush money\" case.\n\nThree Counts\n\nThe \"gag order and impending sentence against Trump interfere with his ability to freely travel and campaign and interfere with the right of Americans everywhere -- and members of the Electoral College in particular -- to hear Trump's political speech,\" the motion argues:\n\nNothing is more destructive to the health of a democracy than distrust in the outcome of an election. And yet New York has brought transparently weak charges for the transparent purpose of trying to impose political damage against Trump and trying to restrain his ability to campaign in advance of an election forecasted by the polls to be very close.\n\nThat, and Bragg's \"weak\" charges invited legal experts left and right to say they were and are outrageous.\n\n\"Boston University law professor Jed Handelsman Shugerman, a vehement critic of Trump, wrote an article in The New York Times castigating the charges as 'a disaster,' 'a setback for the rule of law,' and 'a dangerous precedent,'\" the motion argues.\n\nDespite Shugerman, Harvard law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, and others, Bragg forged ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, the judge, Juan Merchan, trespassed \"state judicial ethics rules by donating to the Biden campaign and to a group called 'Stop Republicans,'\" the motion notes. And his daughter is a leftist political consultant who will gain financially given that Trump was convicted.\n\nBut instead of recusing himself, the motion continues, Merchan imposed a gag order on Trump to stop him from criticizing the daughter.\n\nBragg's \"weak\" case involved misdemeanor \"bookkeeping offenses\" for which the statute of limitations had expired. But to skirt that legal difficulty, he boosted the charge to felonies by claiming they were committed \"with intent to commit another crime.\"\n\nAmusingly, and as Shugerman and others observed, \"Bragg refused to specifically identify what conduct other than bookkeeping offenses Trump was accused of committing.\"\n\nThe motion observes that Bragg chased Trump the way Inspector Javert chased Jean Valjean. Bragg was \"involved in more than 100 cases against President Trump while working at the New York Attorney General's Office.\"\n\nAnd, of course, he promised during his campaign for Manhattan DA to prosecute Trump.\n\nBragg \"resurrected\" the case \"under a legal theory that his predecessor had previously sent 'back into the grave,' out of concerns that the felony charges would not hold up in court.\"\n\nYet Bragg didn't go after Trump until after he announced his run for the White House.\n\nThat timing shows political motivation, the motion argues, particularly given that Biden wanted Trump prosecuted, and again, Bragg hired a prosecutor from Biden's Justice Department:\n\nFor example, after the FBI and DOJ declined to prosecute Trump for more than a year, word \"leaked\" to The New York Times that President Biden thought President Trump \"should be prosecuted.\" ...\n\nOne month after Trump announced he was running for President in 2024, Bragg hired [Matthew] Colangelo, the former number-three at the DOJ, to \"jump-start\" his office's investigation of President Trump. Colangelo had a \"history of taking on Donald J. Trump and his family business\" and was purportedly hired for this reason.\n\nThe Counts\n\nThe first count of the motion alleges \"interference with the Presidential Election in Other States.\" The gag order and forthcoming sentence \"impede the ability of Missouri's electors to become fully informed before casting their ballots.\"\n\nIndeed, prospective Missouri electors, the motion argues, \"have filed affidavits expressing their prospects of becoming an elector and their interest in being able to hear Trump's campaign free from the coercive constraints imposed by New York.\"\n\nNew York \"has no authority\" to interfere with Missouri electors doing their job.\n\nNor may New York's criminal proceedings affect the presidency or a campaign, the motion argues, without substantial justification. And that it does not have.\n\nThe second count says New York is violating a federal ruling that forbids court orders that affect elections or confuse voters. Both will occur if the gag order and sentencing stand as they are.\n\nLast, the gag order and sentencing violate the First Amendment to the federal Constitution because voters cannot hear Trump's campaign speech. He \"was specifically targeted for the purpose of trying to impose political damage and interfere in Trump's political campaign,\" the motion argues:\n\nAnd there is no reason for New York to impose a gag order and sentence now rather than waiting and permitting the Presidential election to proceed unimpeded.\n\nLawfare and Cuomo\n\nThe motion also details the long history of leftist lawfare against Trump. It reminds the justices that the FBI \"criminally fabricated evidence to obtain a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.\"\n\nAnd after that, \"political opponents then harassed President Trump by pressing a baseless conspiracy theory that Trump was a 'Russian asset.'\"\n\nThat, of course, was the notorious Russian Collusion hoax that Hillary Clinton and her campaign button men conceived to ruin Trump.\n\nBut seemingly worse for New York in the motion is what Cuomo told Bill Maher on his Overtime program:\n\nIf his name was not Donald Trump and if he wasn't running for president ... I'm telling you that case would've never been brought.\n\n\"I will not sit idly by while Soros-backed prosecutors hold Missouri voters hostage in this presidential election,\" Bailey said in an X thread. \"I am filing suit to ensure every Missourian can exercise their right to hear from and vote for their preferred presidential candidate.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenewamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_cort_kirkwood@thenewamerican.com", "name": "R.

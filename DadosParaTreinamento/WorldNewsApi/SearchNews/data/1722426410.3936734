Bahamas economy minister Michael Halkitis told Reuters that a so-called \u201cdebt-for-nature\u201d swap would launch in the next two to four months and focus on improving the country\u2019s network of marine parks and protected areas. The country\u2019s prime minister had signalled a deal was on the cards earlier this year \u2013 nearby Barbados, Belize and Ecuador have all completed debt-for-nature swaps in recent years \u2013 but Halkitis\u2019 comments are the first firm outline of The Bahamas\u2019 plan. The swap will involve less than $500 million of debt. The country has $2.9 billion of international bonds USP06518AG23=, USP06518AK35=TE outstanding in total, meaning it could still involve well over 10% of it. \u201cWe already have a lot of marine protected areas. So the focus (of the debt swap) is not so much on additional areas, but on improving the management of some of the areas that we have,\u201d he said during an interview in London. \u201cAround the fall, you\u2019ll hear some more about it\u201d. The Bahamas has a strong incentive. It established the world\u2019s first protected land and sea park, Exuma Cays, in 1958 which spans more than 100,000 acres of ocean and is home to the Western Hemisphere\u2019s second largest coral barrier reef. While market sensitivity meant Halkitis was not able to provide a more precise timing of the swap, his guidance suggests somewhere between late August and Oct. 21, when both the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Samoa and the United Nations\u2019 Biodiversity COP in Colombia begin, looks most likely. The swap would be made possible by an Inter-American Development Bank credit guarantee to cut the debt, Halkitis said. The first debt-for-nature swap was struck in 1987 and more than 100 deals have since followed, although using them to reduce international bond market debt has only taken off in recent years. At their simplest, they see part of a country\u2019s debt bought up by a bank or specialist investor and replaced, usually helped by a multilateral development bank credit guarantee, with a new lower-cost \u201cnature\u201d bond. Some of the savings they generate then fund conservation or projects, such as water sanitation, deemed environmentally beneficial. A separate source involved in The Bahamas plan told Reuters that non-profit The Nature Conservancy (TNC) \u2013 which has played a role in other debt swaps \u2013 was undertaking design work for the deal. The Bahamas\u2019 debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 75%, from just over 50%, after the COVID-19 pandemic slammed its vital tourism industry. It now spends around 18% of its revenues just paying the interest on its borrowings, credit rating S&P Global estimates.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/news/regional/bahamas-readies-caribbeans-next-debt-for-nature-swap/\" title=\"Bahamas readies Caribbean\u2019s next \u2018debt-for-nature\u2019 swap\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img width=\"845\" height=\"574\" src=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Michael-Halkitis.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 15px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Michael-Halkitis.jpg 845w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Michael-Halkitis-736x500.jpg 736w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Michael-Halkitis-768x522.jpg 768w, https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Michael-Halkitis-147x100.jpg 147w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" /></a><p>LONDON,&#xA0; (Reuters)&#xA0;&#8211;&#xA0;The Bahamas is to join a growing trend where countries promise better protection of precious ecosystems in return for having their debts reduced.<", "url": "https://www.stabroeknews.com/2024/06/29/news/regional/bahamas-readies-caribbeans-next-debt-for-nature-swap/", "image": "https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2024/06/Michael-Halkitis.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:03:23", "author": "Stabroek News", "authors": ["Stabroek News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gy", "sentiment": 0.031}

Before the end of this week, the Commission will publish the final figures of new voters in the two States as well as their distribution by gender, age, occupation and disability. Thereafter, the timetable for the collection of uncollected Permanent Voters' Cards (PVCs) from previous registration and new registrants from the latest CVR will be published.\n\n\"The Commission is aware that going by our Timetable and Schedule of Activities, the register of voters will be published not later than 30 days before the date fixed for the election. We wish to reassure the Chairmen of political parties that each party fielding candidates in the forthcoming Governorship election in Edo State will receive the softcopy of the register on 20th August 2024 while that of Ondo State will take place on 15th October 2024.\"\n\nThe Commission Chairman who gave Tuesday as deadline for parties to submit list of agents expressed strong reservations about the indifference on part of political parties to meet up with the deadline.\n\n\"As the Edo State Governorship approaches, I wish to remind leaders of political parties of your obligation to submit the list of your agents by uploading the required information, including photographs, to the dedicated portal. This requirement is listed as item 9 on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the election released by the Commission nearly a year ago on 26th September 2023.\n\n\"As at yesterday, Sunday 28th July 2024, 14 political parties have uploaded the details of 38,354 polling agents and 819 collation agents for the Edo State Governorship election. Three parties are yet to upload a single polling agent while five parties have not uploaded a single agent for Ward, Local Government and State collation centers. The deadline is tomorrow Tuesday 30th July 2024 when the portal automatically shuts down at midnight. I urge you to ensure that you meet the deadline so that the Commission can produce the accreditation tags and deliver them to you for distribution to your agents in good time.\"\n\nIn his remarks, National Chairman of the Inter party Advisory Council, Yusuf Mamman Dantalle, called for the scrapping of the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) urging the National Assembly to transfer the responsibility to INEC.\n\nThe IPAC National Chairman dismissed local government elections conducted by SIECs as mockery of democratic ethos and practises.\n\nHe frowned at move by the National Assembly to create Local Government Independent Electoral Commission.\n\nHe said: \"To further deepen democracy at the grassroots level, IPAC demands the immediate scrapping of the States Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs). The charade called elections they conduct is an aberration, dent and mockery of our emerging democracy; a waste of tax payers' money that ought to have been channeled to developmental projects.\n\n\"SIECS do not have voter registers, BVAS, IReV portals, ballot boxes and trained personnel to conduct credible elections. The polls they pretend to conduct contribute to voters' apathy and distrust in the electoral process.\n\n\"To restore confidence in the electoral system, INEC should be empowered to conduct all Local Government elections. Politics is local, citizens should be encouraged to actively participate in grassroots politics and contribute in building a better society.\n\n\"In this vein, IPAC calls for the amendment of the Constitution and the Electoral Act to empower INEC to conduct all Local Governments polls. Council rejects the proposed bill by the Senate to create the so-called Local Government Independent Electoral Commission, bearing in mind that it would be another SIEC in disguise. It is unacceptable, ill-conceived, another electoral jamboree that will impede the nation's democracy and waste public funds at a time when citizens demand a smaller government to reduce the cost of governance.\n\n\"Addressing the Senate and House of Representatives Joint Committee on Electoral Matters last week, INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu said the commission had the capacity to conduct all Local Government elections as it did for FCT Area Councils generally adjudged to be free and fair and without rancour. IPAC supports this and urges the National Assembly to amend the relevant electoral laws to accommodate it. \"\n\nALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taiwo_amodu@tribuneonlineng.com", "name": "Taiwo Amodu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_National_Electoral_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent National Electoral Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ondo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ondo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakubu_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yakubu (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmood_Yakubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmood Yakubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/INEC-3-e1721667827315.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772938", "eventUri": "eng-9772938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Vehicles have been repaired while other movable and immovable facilities have been serviced, refurbished or are being gradually replaced.\n\n\"We have delivered additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines to Edo State for the training of election duty personnel as well as contingency for Election Day support,'' Yakubu said.\n\nHe also disclosed that INEC had amended the list to the published final list of candidates for the state election following recent Court Order mandating INEC commission to replace the running mate of the Labour Party's candidate.\n\nYakubu also urged political parties participating in the election to ensure to meet up with the deadline in uploading the details of their agents for Edo election to enable the commission to produce their accreditation tags on time.\n\n\"As at yesterday, Sunday July 28, fourteen political parties have uploaded the details of 38,354 polling agents and 819 collation agents for the Edo State Governorship election.\n\n\"Three parties are yet to upload a single polling agent while five parties have not uploaded a single agent for Ward, Local Government and State collation centres.\n\n\"The deadline is tomorrow Tuesday July 30 when the portal automatically shuts down at midnight,'' he said.\n\nYakubu advised party leaders to demonstrate compliance with the commission's Regulations and Guidelines for Political Parties 2022, in their campaigns for Edo and Ondo governorship election.\n\n\"The campaign period has often been characterised by acrimony and tension. Sadly, it is also a period of verbal abuse and physical confrontation among parties, candidates and their supporters.\n\n\"The Commission finds the recent event in Edo State resulting in the death of a security personnel worrisome. Happily, there has been no incident known to the Commission since then.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the Commission will meet with the security agencies under the auspices of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES).\n\n\" I want to assure you that security in Edo and Ondo will be a major issue for discussion at the meeting.\n\n\"We are as concerned about the safety of your

voter register for the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States being finalised would be published before the end of the week.\n\nHe said that thereafter, the timetable for the collection of uncollected Permanent Voters' Cards (PVCs) would be published.\n\nYakubu also said that date for the conduct of bye-elections in Oyo , Kaduna and four other states would soon be announced.\n\nIn his remarks, IPAC Chairman, Alhaji Yusuf Dantalle, pledged the council's commitment to work with INEC for voter sensitization and the conduct of credible polls in Edo and Ondo.\n\nDantalle said there was no substitute for free, fair, credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful poll.\n\n\"The success of this (Edo) election along with Ondo's will go a long way in restoring trust in the democratic process essential for enduring representative governance.\n\n\"Once we get our elections right and credible leaders emerge, there will be drastic reduction in elections petitions and litigations,\" he said.\n\nDantalle urged citizens to close ranks, and imbibe issue-based campaigns and participate in making Nigeria elections transparent and accept the will of the people expressed in their votes.\n\nHe said the era of do-or-die politics and vote trading was over.\n\n\"As INEC continues to improve on its various technologies that will enhance electoral integrity, Nigeria will regain its past glory as the great arsenal of democracy in Africa.\n\n\"To achieve this, IPAC strongly advocates for the establishment of the Electoral Offences Commission to prosecute electoral offenders to

There is no substitute for a free, fair, credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful poll.\n\n\"The success of this election along with Ondo's will go a long way in restoring trust in the democratic process essential for enduring representative governance. Flawed elections that produced incompetent leaders are the remote cause of economic stagnation, political upheavals and socio-religious disharmony in the polity as the imposed leaders seek personal

Vehicles have been repaired while other movable and immovable facilities have been serviced, refurbished or are being gradually replaced.\n\n\"We have delivered additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines to Edo State for the training of election duty personnel as well as contingency for Election Day support,'' Yakubu said.\n\nHe also disclosed that INEC had amended the list to the published final list of candidates for the state election following recent Court Order mandating INEC commission to replace the running mate of the Labour Party's candidate.\n\nYakubu also urged political parties participating in the election to ensure to meet up with the deadline in uploading the details of their agents for Edo election to enable the commission to produce their accreditation tags on time.\n\n\"As at yesterday, Sunday July 28, fourteen political parties have uploaded the details of 38,354 polling agents and 819 collation agents for the Edo State Governorship election.\n\n\"Three parties are yet to upload a single polling agent while five parties have not uploaded a single agent for Ward, Local Government and State collation centres.\n\n\"The deadline is tomorrow Tuesday July 30 when the portal automatically shuts down at midnight,'' he said.\n\nYakubu advised party leaders to demonstrate compliance with the commission's Regulations and Guidelines for Political Parties 2022, in their campaigns for Edo and Ondo governorship election.\n\n\"The campaign period has often been characterised by acrimony and tension. Sadly, it is also a period of verbal abuse and physical confrontation among parties, candidates and their supporters.\n\n\"The Commission finds the recent event in Edo State resulting in the death of a security personnel worrisome. Happily, there has been no incident known to the Commission since then.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the Commission will meet with the security agencies under the auspices of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES).\n\n\" I want to assure you that security in Edo and Ondo will be a major issue for discussion at the meeting.\n\n\"We are as concerned about the safety of your candidates, agents and supporters as well as about the security of our own officials, observers, journalists, service providers and, above all, the voters,'' he said.\n\nYakubu said that the final voter register for the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States being finalised would be published before the end of the week.\n\nHe said that thereafter, the timetable for the collection of uncollected Permanent Voters' Cards (PVCs) would be published.\n\nYakubu also said that date for the conduct of bye-elections in Oyo , Kaduna and four other states would soon be announced.\n\nIn his remarks, IPAC Chairman, Alhaji Yusuf Dantalle, pledged the council's commitment to work with INEC for voter sensitization and the conduct of credible polls in Edo and Ondo.\n\nDantalle said there was no substitute for free, fair, credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful poll.\n\n\"The success of this (Edo) election along with Ondo's will go a long way in restoring trust in the democratic process essential for enduring representative governance.\n\n\"Once we get our elections right and credible leaders emerge, there will be drastic reduction in elections petitions and litigations,\" he said.\n\nDantalle urged citizens to close ranks, and imbibe issue-based campaigns and participate in making Nigeria elections transparent and accept the will of the people expressed in their votes.\n\nHe said the era of do-or-die politics and vote trading was over.\n\n\"As INEC continues to improve on its various technologies that will enhance electoral integrity, Nigeria will regain its past glory as the great arsenal of democracy in Africa.\n\n\"To achieve this, IPAC strongly advocates for the establishment of the Electoral Offences Commission to prosecute electoral offenders to serve as a deterrent to others who may want to tow this path of dishonour,\" he said.\n\nDantalle reiterated the council's call for the scrapping of States Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) and the empowerment of INEC to conduct all local government elections.\n\n\"Politics is local, citizens should be encouraged to actively participate in grassroots politics and contribute in building a better society.\n\n\"In this vein, IPAC calls for the amendment of the Constitution and the Electoral Act to empower INEC to conduct all Local Governments polls.\n\n\"Council rejects the proposed bill by the Senate to create the so-called Local Government Independent Electoral Commission, bearing in mind that it would be another SIEC in disguise.\n\nAt the meeting were party national chairmen, including National Chairman, Ganduje, and APGA National Chairman, Chief Edozie Njoku, who was attending the meeting for the first time after his recognition by INEC.

The charade called elections they conduct is an aberration, dent and mockery of our emerging democracy; a waste of taxpayers' money that ought to have been channelled to developmental projects' ', Yusuf Mamman Dantalle, IPAC chairman, said.\n\nThe demand came as the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC described as worrisome, the recent killing of a policeman in Edo State ahead of the September 21 governorship election.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu revealed this on Tuesday at the 2024 third regular consultative meeting with political parties in Abuja.\n\nHe said; \"Campaign by political parties and candidates is in full swing in both Edo and Ondo states.

We have since published the final list of candidates but we are once again sharing the list with party leaders at this meeting in view of the recent Court Order mandating the Commission to replace the running mate of the candidate of the Labour Party. The amended list is already published on our website.\n\n\"Following the conclusion of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), the display of the register for claims and objections by citizens, and further data clean-up using the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS), the final register for the 2024 governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states are being finalised. Before the end of this week, the Commission will publish the final figures of new voters in the two states as well as their distribution by gender, age, occupation and disability.

It is unacceptable, ill-conceived, another electoral jamboree that will impede the nation's democracy and waste public funds at a time when citizens demand a smaller government to reduce the cost of governance,\" IPAC stated.\n\nDantalle stressed the need to scrap States Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs) to further deepen democracy at the grassroots level, describing elections conducted by SIECs as an aberration, dent and mockery of \"our emerging democracy; a waste of tax payers' money that ought to have been channeled to developmental projects.\"\n\nHe said: \"SIECS do not have voter registers, BVAS, IReV portals, ballot boxes and trained personnel to conduct credible elections. The polls they pretend to conduct contribute to voter apathy and distrust in the electoral process.\n\n\"To restore confidence in the electoral system, INEC should be empowered to conduct all local government elections.

MAHMOOD YAKUBU, AT THE THIRD REGULAR QUARTERLY CONSULTATIVE MEETING WITH POLITICAL PARTIES FOR 2024 HELD AT THE INEC CONFERENCE ROOM, ABUJA, ON MONDAY 29TH JULY 2024\n\nChairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC)\n\nChairmen and other Leaders of Political Parties\n\nNational Commissioners\n\nThe Acting Secretary to the Commission\n\nThe Director General of The Electoral Institute\n\nOther Senior Officials of the Commission\n\nMembers of the INEC Press Corps\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\n\n1. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the third regular quarterly consultative meeting for this year. You may recall that our first meeting for the year was held on Tuesday 19th March 2024 while the second took place two months ago on Monday 13th May 2024. You may also recall that the last meeting focused mainly on the forthcoming Edo State and Ondo State Governorship elections. Today, we will furthermore brief you on the bye-elections that occurred since our last meeting.\n\n2. It is now 53 days to the Edo State Governorship election coming up on Saturday 21st September 2024. Our preparations are going on in earnest. I am glad to report that we have recovered from the torrential rainfall that resulted in the severe flooding of our State Headquarters in Benin City two months ago. The damage to the physical infrastructure has been fixed. Vehicles have been repaired while other movable and immovable facilities have been serviced, refurbished or are being gradually replaced. We have delivered additional Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines to Edo State for the training of election duty personnel as well as contingency for Election Day support. We have since published the final list of candidates but we are once again sharing the list with party leaders at this meeting in view of the recent Court Order mandating the Commission to replace the running mate of the candidate of the Labour Party. The amended list is already published on our website.\n\n3. Following the conclusion of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), the display of the register for claims and objections by citizens, and further data clean-up using the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS), the final register for the 2024 Governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States are being finalised. Before the end of this week, the Commission will publish the final figures of new voters in the two States as well as their distribution by gender, age, occupation and disability. Thereafter, the timetable for the collection of uncollected Permanent Voters' Cards (PVCs) from previous registration and new registrants from the latest CVR will be published.\n\n4. The Commission is aware that going by our Timetable and Schedule of Activities, the register of voters will be published not later than 30 days before the date fixed for the election. We wish to reassure the Chairmen of political parties that each party fielding candidates in the forthcoming Governorship election in Edo State will receive the softcopy of the register on 20th August 2024 while that of Ondo State will take place on 15th October 2024.\n\n5. As the Edo State Governorship approaches, I wish to remind leaders of political parties of your obligation to submit the list of your agents by uploading the required information, including photographs, to the dedicated portal. This requirement is listed as item 9 on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the election released by the Commission nearly a year ago on 26th September 2023.\n\n6. As at yesterday, Sunday 28th July 2024, 14 political parties have uploaded the details of 38,354 polling agents and 819 collation agents for the Edo State Governorship election. Three parties are yet to upload a single polling agent while five parties have not uploaded a single agent for Ward, Local Government and State collation centers. The deadline is tomorrow Tuesday 30th July 2024 when the portal automatically shuts down at midnight. I urge you to ensure that you meet the deadline so that the Commission can produce the accreditation tags and deliver them to you for distribution to your agents in good time.\n\n7. Campaign by political parties and candidates is in full swing in both Edo and Ondo States. This is the time for party leaders to demonstrate compliance with the Commission's Regulations and Guidelines for Political Parties 2022, especially the aspect dealing with rallies, processions and campaigns already available on our website. As a reminder, however, hard copies of the document have been included in your folders for this meeting.\n\n8. The campaign period has often been characterised by acrimony and tension. Sadly, it is also a period of verbal abuse and physical confrontation among parties, candidates and their supporters. The Commission finds the recent event in Edo State resulting in the death of a security personnel worrisome. Happily, there has been no incident known to the Commission since then. Nevertheless, the Commission will meet with the security agencies under the auspices of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES). I want to assure you that security in Edo and Ondo will be a major issue for discussion at the meeting. We are as concerned about the safety of your candidates, agents and supporters as we are about the security of our own officials, observers, journalists, service providers and, above all, the voters.\n\n9. Turning to the issue of bye-elections, you may recall that at our last meeting, I informed you of the existence of vacancies in four States, involving three State Constituencies and one Federal Constituency. Since then, two more vacancies have been declared by the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives following the death of the members representing Ibadan North Federal Constituency of Oyo State and the Chikun/Kajuru Federal Constituency of Kaduna State. The Commission will soon announce the dates for the bye-elections.\n\n10. Once again, I welcome you to this meeting. I thank you and God bless.", "source": {"uri": "nationaldailyng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Daily NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sunday_odibashi@nationaldailyng.com", "name": "Sunday Odibashi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakubu_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakubu (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_National_Electoral_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent National Electoral Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ondo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ondo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmood_Yakubu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahmood Yakubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benin City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Benin City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_(electoral_subdivision)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ward (electoral subdivision)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajuru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kajuru"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kajuru"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikun", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chikun"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chikun"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadan_North", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ibadan North"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibadan North"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaduna_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaduna State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kaduna State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oyo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oyo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nationaldailyng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/INEC-chairman.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772938", "eventUri": "eng-9772938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-21", "textStart": 98, "textEnd": 110}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

It also means that governments at all levels must be held accountable as power resides in the people.\n\n\"In this regard, IPAC commends the recent financial autonomy granted to the 774 Local Governments in Nigeria following the landmark judgement of the Supreme Court. It will go a long way in transforming the nation and providing basic social amenities to citizens at the third tier of government.\n\n\"To further deepen democracy at the grassroots level, IPAC demands the immediate scrapping of the States Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs).\n\n\"The charade called elections they conduct is an aberration, dent and mockery of our emerging democracy; a waste of tax payers' money that ought to have been channeled to developmental projects.\n\n\"SIECS do not have voter registers, BVAS, IReV portals, ballot boxes and trained personnel to conduct credible elections.\n\n\"The polls they pretend to conduct contribute to voters' apathy and distrust in the electoral process.\n\n\"To restore confidence in the electoral system, INEC should be empowered to conduct all Local Government elections. \"Politics is local, citizens should be encouraged to actively participate in grassroots politics and contribute in building a better society.\n\n\"In this vein, IPAC calls for the amendment of the Constitution and the Electoral Act to empower INEC to conduct all Local Governments polls. \"Council rejects the proposed bill by the Senate to create the so-called Local Government Independent Electoral Commission, bearing in mind that it would be another SIEC in disguise.\n\n\"It is unacceptable, ill-conceived, another electoral jamboree that will impede the nation's democracy and waste public funds at a time when citizens demand a smaller government to reduce the cost of governance\", the IPAC Chairman declared\n\nHe insisted that for the forthcoming Edo election, there is no substitute for credible election in order to restore the electoral integrity and mass participation.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, INEC chairman, reminded political parties on the need to upload details of their agents on the portal before it shuts down in the next 48hrs.\n\nThe commission said that it is ready for the Edo and Ondo polls despite the challenges it recently had in those locations, affirming that damages to the physical infrastructure has been fixed.

It will go a long way in transforming the nation and providing basic social amenities to citizens at the third tier of government.\n\n\"To further deepen democracy at the grassroots level, IPAC demands the immediate scrapping of the States Independent Electoral Commissions (SIECs).\n\n\"The charade called elections they conduct is an aberration, dent and mockery of our emerging democracy; a waste of tax payers' money that ought to have been channeled to developmental projects.\n\n\"SIECS do not have voter registers, BVAS, IReV portals, ballot boxes and trained personnel to conduct credible elections.\n\n\"The polls they pretend to conduct contribute to voters' apathy and distrust in the electoral process.\n\n\"To restore confidence in the electoral system, INEC should be empowered to conduct all Local Government elections. \"Politics is local, citizens should be encouraged to actively participate in grassroots politics and contribute in building a better society.\n\n\"In this vein, IPAC calls for the amendment of the Constitution and the Electoral Act to empower INEC to conduct all Local Governments polls. \"Council rejects the proposed bill by the Senate to create the so-called Local Government Independent Electoral Commission, bearing in mind that it would be another SIEC in disguise.\n\n\"It is unacceptable, ill-conceived, another electoral jamboree that will impede the nation's democracy and waste public funds at a time when citizens demand a smaller government to reduce the cost of governance\", the IPAC Chairman declared\n\nHe

observers in good time.\n\nThe INEC Chairman noted that some organisations have requested additional slots for observers to deploy in two elections but stated that the \"commission will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis depending on the organisation's previous experience, size, capacity and record of compliance with the guidelines and code of conduct for election observation.\"\n\nHe solicited the CSOs' support in the sensitisation of the electorate for the collection of their permanent voter's cards (PVCs), and for peaceful conduct during the election.\n\n\"Campaign by political parties and candidates is in full swing in both Edo and Ondo States.\n\n\"We urge you to intensify your advocacy for peaceful elections, including engagement with stakeholders,\" he added and condemned the attack recently in Edo State that resulted in the death of security personnel.\n\nProf. Yakubu who disclosed that INEC will meet with members of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES), said security in the Edo and Ondo elections would be a major issue for discussion at the meeting.\n\n\"We are as concerned about the safety of candidates, agents and supporters as we are about the security of our own officials, observers, journalists, service providers and, above all, the voters,\" he assured.\n\nHe enjoined the accredited observers to\n\ncomply with the objectives of election observation and the code of conduct contained in INEC's rules of engagement for accredited election observers.\n\nProf. Yakubu reiterated that the commission reserves the right to revoke the accreditation of any individual observer or observer group that violates the code of conduct for election observation.", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType":

This landmark ruling is a major stride towards strengthening our democracy at the grassroots level. Local governments are the closest tier of government to the people, and their autonomy is crucial for effective governance and development.\n\n\"However, for this autonomy to be truly conclusive and impactful, there is a need for constitutional amendments by the National Assembly. Specifically, the relevant sections of the constitution should be amended to empower INEC to conduct elections for local governments across the country. Currently, INEC enjoys constitutional authority to conduct national and sub-national elections. Extending this authority to include the third tier of government will ensure uniformity, credibility, and efficiency in the electoral process.\n\n'In light of this, the proposal to create an Independent Local Government Electoral Commission is, in my view, unnecessary. Establishing a separate body for local government elections could lead to redundancy, increased bureaucracy, and potential conflicts of interest. Instead, leveraging INEC's established framework, experience, and resources would be a more efficient and effective approach to managing local government elections.\"\n\nIn his opening remarks, INEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu, who assured the gathering of senior journalists of adequate security for media personnel ahead of the off-season governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states, restated his admonition that journalists should be factual in their reportage of election coverage.\n\nHe said, \"We are as concerned about the safety of your personnel and equipment as we are about the security of our own officials, observers, service providers, and, above all, the voters.\n\n\"We will also work with the security agencies to ensure that accredited journalists are granted unimpeded access to all voting and collation locations.\n\n\"At the same time, I wish to remind you of your obligation as journalists to report factually and accurately about the election and electoral activities in compliance with the ethics of your noble profession. You should continue to be a bulwark against fake news, misinformation and disinformation. I urge you to fully comply with the Nigerian Media Code of Election Coverage.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taiwo_amodu@tribuneonlineng.com", "name": "Taiwo Amodu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_National_Electoral_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent National Electoral Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria_Union_of_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria Union of Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union_of_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Union of Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmood_Yakubu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahmood Yakubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ondo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ondo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tribuneonlineng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NUJ-President-Chief-Chris-Isiguzo-e1722440544987.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772938", "eventUri": "eng-9772938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

against fake news, misinformation and disinformation.\n\nProf. Yakubu who stated that the media are partners in election management, urged journalists to always comply with the Nigerian media code of election coverage, as well as the INEC guidelines for media accreditation.\n\nHe reminded them that accreditation for media organisations wishing to cover the Edo State election is still open, and will close on September 5.\n\nThe INEC Chairman disclosed that only details of 227 media personnel have been uploaded on the commission's portal for media accreditation, and urged interested media organisations to expedite action by ensuring that they submit their applications before the deadline.\n\n\"This will enable the commission to produce and deliver the accreditation tags for your reporters, camera operators, technical and other support staff in good time for the election,\" he stated.\n\nHe assured that INEC will work with the security agencies to ensure that accredited journalists are granted unimpeded access to all voting and collation locations.\n\nNational President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Chris Isiguzo, said the media collaboration with INEC is essential in achieving accurate and objective reporting of electoral activities.\n\nHe however appealed to the security agencies to extend the necessary support and partnership with the media in order to check incessant harassment and intimidation of journalists on election duties.\n\nIsiguzo who welcomed the Supreme Court judgement on financial autonomy for local government councils, argued that for \"this autonomy to be truly conclusive and impactful, there is a need for constitutional amendments by the National Assembly\" to empower INEC to conduct elections into local government councils across the country.\n\nHe stated that extending INEC's power to conduct local government elections \"will ensure uniformity, credibility, and efficiency in the electoral process.\"\n\nHe therefore called for the creation of an Independent Local Government Electoral Commission, stating that \"establishing a separate body for local government elections could lead to redundancy, increased bureaucracy, and potential conflicts of interest.\n\n\"Instead, leveraging INEC's established framework, experience, and resources would be a more efficient and effective approach to managing local government elections.\"", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_telegraph@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "New Telegraph",

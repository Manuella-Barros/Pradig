{"id": 231945716, "title": "27 Wild And Heartbreaking Friend Group Breakup Stories", "text": "27. And finally, we'll end with a longer story: \"Our friend group was a group of three. ... There was me, Derek, and Rob. Rob was ... usually the life of the party. Derek was a lot more laid back; just a good man but not really good with the ladies. I was kind of just there as the youngest and most immature. ... Rob graduated way before the rest of us. Derek was next, and I was the last one left in high school. We all kind of drifted apart after high school. Derek joined the military.\" \"Rob just kind of kept doing the same shit he always did in high school: cheating on girls, drugs, selling drugs, etc...I just kept working since I was the poverty-stricken one. Around 2009, my sister called me, hysterical, saying that our friend Derek had passed away. It kind of hit me like a splash of cold water. I was stunned and in denial. There was no way...Anyway, I reached out to our old friend group (Rob and some others who joined the group after they'd graduated). They weren't good people, so consequently, I'd stopped hanging out with the group. Rob just attracted that sort of crowd, and Derek was just one of those see-good-in-everyone types. The story I was able to piece together was this: One of the newly-joined friends to the group was getting married, so this night was his bachelor party. They started at a strip club, but another in the group suggested that they should end the night in the next state over so they could gamble at a casino. Derek went and withdrew... a couple thousand in cash so he could pay for the groom-to-be to gamble and maybe some others in the group who may have been struggling at the time so everyone could be part of the celebration. While at the strip club, one of the dancers noticed that Derek had a lot of cash. ... She started to be extra clingy with him and eventually asked what he was doing when they were done. He told her the plan. Well, she wanted to tag along and just hang with him while everyone else was partying it up since he was more laid back. ... He agreed, and the plan was for her to leave work, go home, and change, and they could pick her up there. Once they got to her place, he knocked on the door. The dancer's boyfriend was waiting to ambush my buddy for his cash. He ran around the side of the house and hit him square in the face. My buddy was two sheets to the wind at this point, so there was no bracing for the hit or any expectation of anything other than picking up a cute girl. He went down like a sack of potatoes and landed straight on the back of his head. He was bleeding everywhere, and the 'friend group' all finally noticed what was going on, and they ran out to help him. They got him back into the car and drove him home. They had to drive past THREE hospitals to get to his house. He was unconscious and bleeding all over the back of the car. They got him home, a whole hour away from where this all happened. He didn't live in our hometown anymore, so they took him to his mother's house. They left him on the couch and told his mother that he just had a lot to drink. (They must have cleaned him up by this point.) She thanked them for bringing him home 'safely.' The next morning, it was getting late into the day, and Derek's mother got worried and tried to wake him up. He had passed away in his sleep. His mother and sister never really got over the whole thing. He really was a shining light in the lives of many, myself included. I wasn't there, so some of the information I was given I can't really take to heart, but a lot seem to believe that this was all a setup, and when they took him to his mother's house, they knew they shouldn't have. They just wanted a quick cash grab, I guess? I never thought a few thousand dollars was worth our friend's life. I still think about him today and how I haven't seen his mother or his sister in years. They don't live in the same house anymore. The funeral was the last time we were all together. ... I don't really speak to the group anymore. As a matter of fact, when someone from those early days in my life asks about our old group, I get kind of angry and upset inside and wish I knew what really happened and why the hell they decided to neglect medical care for someone who wouldn't have done the same to them.\" \u2014u/RedcrosKnight", "summary": "<h1>\"We literally grew up together.

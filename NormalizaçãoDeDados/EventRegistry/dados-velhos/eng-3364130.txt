He spent the second half of last season on loan at Spanish team Las Palmas.\n\nStoke, a team from central England that is a perennial mid-table finisher in the Premier League, has become a haven for former high-profile players or one-time prodigies whose careers have stalled.\n\nSince 2014, forwards Bojan Krkic and Ibrahim Afellay have joined from Barcelona while ex-Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Inter Milan. They all have Champions League winners' medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nMost were back-ups for their clubs in their Champions League-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.\n\n\"Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we're delighted he has chosen to join us,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said. \"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\"\n\nJese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.\n\nStoke announced the arrival of Jese in a tweet that included audio clips from pundits in the British media saying the club lacked ambition and would struggle in the Premier League this season.\n\nThe team managed by Mark Hughes lost 1-0 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday.\n\nJese was a highly rated youngster at Real Madrid and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real's reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.\n\nHe signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute.\n\nAlthough technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery's plans -- although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.\n\nJese is Stoke's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.", "id": "9750934", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "LIVE - Everton, AC

Image courtesy: Twitter @premierleague\n\nThe 24-year-old Spanish youth international only joined PSG from Real Madrid a year ago but failed to establish himself in the French capital and spent the second half of last season on loan at his native Las Palmas.\n\nHe won the Champions League twice with Real and was top scorer when Spain lifted the European Under-19 Championship in 2012.\n\nHe is Stoke manager Mark Hughes's sixth signing of the season joining the likes of Darren Fletcher, Kurt Zouma, Maxim Choupa-Moting, Bruno Martins Indi and Josh Tymon at The Potters.\n\nJese will replace fellow Spanish forward Joselu in the Stoke squad after the latter agreed on Wednesday to join Newcastle United for a reported \u00a35m.\n\nJese scored 12 goals in 63 La Liga appearances for Real before joining PSG for 25 million euros ($29 million) but his chances of forcing his way into the Parisian first team slimmed following the world record signing of Brazilian superstar Neymar.\n\nPSG insisted, though, that Jese could yet feature in their future plans and that the loan doesn't include a clause to make the move permanent.\n\n\"The loan to Stoke City doesn't include an option to buy. Jese is under contract with Paris Saint-Germain until 2021,\" said the Ligue 1 giants.\n\nThe signing of Neymar means several more players are likely to leave PSG before the transfer window shuts on 31 August.\n\nFrench international forward Hatem Ben Arfa and Polish international midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak, both signed a year ago, are rumoured to be on their way out after failing to impress PSG coach Unai Emery.\n\nFrance midfielder Blaise Matuidi is believed to be heading to Italian champions Juventus while controversial Ivory Coast full-back Serge Aurier could also be on his way.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 04:29 pm | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 04:29 pm\n\nTags :#Football#Jese rodriguez#Kickingaround#Ligue 1#Paris-saint germain#Premier league#Stoke city", "id":

(AP Photo/Kamil Zihnioglu, File)\n\nStoke, a team from central England that is a perennial mid-table finisher in the Premier League, has become a haven for former high-profile players or one-time prodigies whose careers have stalled.\n\nSince 2014, forwards Bojan Krkic and Ibrahim Afellay have joined from Barcelona while ex-Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Inter Milan. They all have Champions League winners' medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nMost were back-ups for their clubs in their Champions League-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.\n\n\"Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we're delighted he has chosen to join us,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said. \"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\"\n\nJese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.\n\nStoke announced the arrival of Jese in a tweet that included audio clips from pundits in the British media saying the club lacked ambition and would struggle in the Premier League this season.\n\nThe team managed by Mark Hughes lost 1-0 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday.\n\nJese was a highly rated youngster at Real Madrid and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real's reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.\n\nHe signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute.\n\nAlthough technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery's plans - although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.\n\nJese is Stoke's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Premier League coverage:

He spent the second half of last season on loan at Spanish team Las Palmas.\n\nStoke, a team from central England that is a perennial mid-table finisher in the Premier League, has become a haven for former high-profile players or one-time prodigies whose careers have dipped.\n\nSince 2014, forwards Bojan Krkic and Ibrahim Afellay have joined from Barcelona while ex-Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Inter Milan. They all have Champions League winners' medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nMost were back-ups for their clubs in their Champions League-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.\n\n\"Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we're delighted he has chosen to join us,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said. \"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\"\n\nJese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.\n\nStoke announced the arrival of Jese in a tweet that included audio clips from pundits in the British media saying the club lacked ambition and would struggle in the Premier League this season.\n\nThe team managed by Mark Hughes lost 1-0 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday.\n\nJese was a highly rated youngster at Real Madrid and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real's reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.\n\nHe signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute.\n\nAlthough technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery's plans - although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.\n\nJese is Stoke's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Premier League coverage:

He spent the second half of last season on loan at Spanish team Las Palmas.\n\nAlso, Swansea playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson sealed a drawn-out transfer to Everton after completing a medical examination. Everton is reportedly paying 45 million pounds (US$58 million) for the Iceland international, who would be a fourth attacking player to arrive at Goodison Park this summer after Wayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez and Davy Klaassen.\n\nStoke, a team from central England that is a perennial mid-table finisher in the English Premier League, has become a haven for former high-profile players or one-time prodigies whose careers have dipped.\n\nSince 2014, forwards Bojan Krkic and Ibrahim Afellay have joined from Barcelona while ex-Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Inter Milan. They all have UCL winners' medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nMost were back-ups for their clubs in their UCL-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.\n\n\"Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we're delighted he has chosen to join us,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said.\n\n\"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\"\n\nJese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham United. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle United for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.\n\nThe team managed by Mark Hughes lost 0-1 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday.\n\nJese was a highly rated youngster at Real and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real's reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.\n\nHe signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute.\n\nAlthough technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery's plans -- although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.\n\nJese is Stoke's sixth signing of the summer transfer window, joining the likes of Fletcher, Kurt Zouma, Maxim Choupa-Moting, Bruno Martins Indi

The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\"\n\nSigurdsson said the prospect of working with Everton boss Ronald Koeman was one of the main reasons for switching to Goodison Park.\n\n\"He was a great player, one of the top players of his time,\" Sigurdsson added.\n\n\"Now he is a really good manager and his vision for Everton is clear. He has built up a really good squad here, with strong players, both young and experienced.\n\n\"This was a key factor for me. Ultimately, that is a dream of mine and everyone at this club. I know the supporters and players would agree with that.\"\n\nSigurdsson began his professional career in England with Reading and joined German side Hoffenheim in 2010.\n\nHe moved on loan to Swansea at the start of 2012 and joined Tottenham in a \u00a36.8 million (\u20ac8.65 million) deal six months later, before returning to Swansea in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, Swansea's player of the year for the past two seasons, has made 50 appearances for Iceland and played a key role in their run to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals.\n\nHis proposed move has dragged on for much of the summer, with Swansea initially valuing their star man at \u00a350 million (\u20ac54.75million).\n\nFinally securing him now, at a slightly lower price, takes Everton's spending since the end of last season to over \u00a3130 million (\u20ac142 million). Sigurdsson follows the likes of Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez as another multi-million-pound acquisition, while the club also secured the free transfer arrival of Wayne Rooney.\n\nSigurdsson, who scored nine goals and provided 13 assists in the league last term, pulled out of Swansea's pre-season tour to the United States after Everton's interest became clear.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training upon Swansea's return from the States but did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nSigurdsson will not feature in Thursday's Europa League play-off against Hajduk Split at Goodison Park, but Koeman indicated he could make his Everton debut in Monday's league clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\n\n\"He will not be involved tomorrow,\" Koeman said. \"Maybe for Monday, I do not know. I need to talk to him and know what his physical state is. Let's wait to see how the fitness is.\"\n\nKoeman said Everton are waiting to learn the severity of an apparent hamstring problem suffered by Ross Barkley.\n\nReports have suggested Barkley, whose future with the club remains unclear, is facing six weeks out due to a hamstring tear.\n\nAsked about that, Koeman said: \"He stopped training, I think it was last Monday. It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests . . . to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nMidfielder Barkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, appears destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a move to Tottenham, but Koeman said last week there had been no offers for the England international.\n\nKoeman, who has let midfielder Gareth Barry join West Brom, also signalled he would like to strengthen in the current transfer window beyond the capture of Sigurdsson.\n\nHe added on Wednesday: \"Still we are looking in two positions to make the squad even stronger than it is at this stage.\"", "id": "9559900", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Everton complete \u20ac49m swoop for Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson", "image":

They all have Champions League winners' medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nMost were back-ups for their clubs in their Champions League-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.\n\n\"Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we're delighted he has chosen to join us,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said. \"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\"\n\nJese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.\n\nStoke announced the arrival of Jese in a tweet that included audio clips from pundits in the British media saying the club lacked ambition and would struggle in the Premier League this season.\n\nThe team managed by Mark Hughes lost 1-0 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday.\n\nJese was a highly rated youngster at Real Madrid and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real's reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nHe signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute.\n\nAlthough technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery's plans -- although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.\n\nJese is Stoke's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Premier League coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/PremierLeague",

He spent the second half of last season on loan at Spanish team Las Palmas.\n\nStoke, a team from central England that is a perennial mid-table finisher in the Premier League, has become a haven for former high-profile players or one-time prodigies whose careers have dipped.\n\nSince 2014, forwards Bojan Krkic and Ibrahim Afellay have joined from Barcelona while ex-Bayern Munich winger Xherdan Shaqiri has arrived from Inter Milan. They all have Champions League winners' medals, as does ex-Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who was an offseason signing from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nMost were back-ups for their clubs in their Champions League-winning campaigns, with Jese an unused substitute for Real in its victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2016 final.\n\n\"Jese was a man in demand when PSG made it clear they would allow him to leave on loan and we're delighted he has chosen to join us,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes said. \"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\"\n\nJese will play out wide and is viewed as a replacement for Marko Arnautovic, who left Stoke this offseason to join West Ham. Stoke also sold Spanish striker Joselu to Newcastle for an undisclosed fee on Wednesday.\n\nStoke announced the arrival of Jese in a tweet that included audio clips from pundits in the British media saying the club lacked ambition and would struggle in the Premier League this season.\n\nThe team managed by Mark Hughes lost 1-0 at Everton in its opening league game of the season on Saturday.\n\nJese was a highly rated youngster at Real Madrid and made his La Liga debut under coach Jose Mourinho in 2012. He mostly played for Real's reserve team and sustained a serious knee injury in March 2014, ruling him out for nine months.\n\nHe signed a five-year deal with PSG last summer but started only one league game, with another eight appearances as substitute.\n\nAlthough technically skilled, Jese has not played so far this season and does not figure in coach Unai Emery's plans -- although the deal with Stoke does not include an option to buy him. At Las Palmas, Jese scored three goals in 13 games.\n\nJese is Stoke's sixth signing of the summer transfer window.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Premier League coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/PremierLeague\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\"\n\nSigurdsson said the prospect of working with Everton boss Ronald Koeman was one of the main reasons for switching to Goodison Park.\n\n\"He was a great player, one of the top players of his time,\" Sigurdsson added.\n\n\"Now he is a really good manager and his vision for Everton is clear. He has built up a really good squad here, with strong players, both young and experienced.\n\n\"This was a key factor for me. Ultimately, that is a dream of mine and everyone at this club. I know the supporters and players would agree with that.\"\n\nSigurdsson began his professional career in England with Reading and joined German side Hoffenheim in 2010.\n\nHe moved on loan to Swansea at the start of 2012 and joined Tottenham in a \u00c2\u00a36.8million deal six months later, before returning to south Wales in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, Swansea's player of the year for the past two seasons, has made 50 appearances for Iceland and played a key role in their run to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals.\n\nHis proposed move has dragged on for much of the summer, with Swansea initially valuing their star man at \u00c2\u00a350million.\n\nFinally securing him now, at a slightly lower price, takes Everton's spending since the end of last season to over \u00c2\u00a3130million.\n\nSigurdsson follows the likes of Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez as another multi-million-pound acquisition, while the club also secured the free transfer arrival of Wayne Rooney.\n\nSigurdsson, who scored nine goals and provided 13 assists in the league last term, pulled out of Swansea's pre-season tour to the United States after Everton's interest became clear.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training upon Swansea's return from the States but did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nSigurdsson will not feature in Thursday's Europa League play-off against Hajduk Split at Goodison Park, but Koeman indicated he could make his Everton debut in Monday's league clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\n\n\"He will not be involved (on Thursday),\" Koeman said. \"Maybe for Monday, I do not know. I need to talk to him and know what his physical state is. Let's wait to see how the fitness is.\"\n\nKoeman said Everton are waiting to learn the severity of an apparent hamstring problem suffered by Ross Barkley.\n\nReports have suggested Barkley, whose future with the club remains unclear, is facing six weeks out due to a hamstring tear.\n\nAsked about that, Koeman said: \"He stopped training, I think it was last Monday. It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests ... to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nMidfielder Barkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, appears destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a move to Tottenham, but Koeman said last week there had been no offers for the England international.\n\nKoeman, who has let midfielder Gareth Barry join West Brom, also signalled he would like to strengthen in the current transfer window beyond the capture of Sigurdsson.\n\nHe added on Wednesday: \"Still we are looking in two positions to make the squad even stronger than it is at this stage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hajduk boss Joan Carrillo has acknowledged Everton's strength ahead of Thursday's European clash, but feels there are weaknesses his team can take advantage of.\n\n\"All the games with this team, we play to win,\" Carrillo said at a pre-match press conference.\n\n\"I do not have another method or philosophy.\n\n\"I know Everton have a very good team. They are in the Premier League. And we are talking about signing one player for 50 million euros. But football is 11 against 11.\n\n\"We know the good things of Everton but also the bad things, and we have worked on this.\n\n\"I am an optimist.

Still we are looking in two positions to make the squad even stronger than it is at this stage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Koeman said Everton are waiting to learn the severity of an apparent hamstring problem suffered by Ross Barkley .\n\nReports have suggested Barkley, whose future with the club remains unclear, is facing six weeks out due to a hamstring tear.\n\nAsked about that, Koeman said: \"He stopped training, I think it was last Monday. It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests ... to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nThe Dutchman added that there was \"no update\" in terms of the 23-year-old's \"situation\", and when asked if he was in his plans for the coming season, he said: \"I will wait until the end of August.\"\n\nBarkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, has appeared destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a

Everton did not reveal the transfer details, saying only that it was a club record. Its previous highest fee was 31.8 million pounds, spent on Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the club,\" Sigurdsson told Everton's website.\n\nWayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez and Davy Klaassen are other attacking players to have joined Everton since the end of last season, as part of an outlay of around 135 million pounds ($175 million) on new players.

I know the supporters and players would agree with that.\"\n\nSigurdsson began his professional career in England with Reading and joined German side Hoffenheim in 2010.\n\nHe moved on loan to Swansea at the start of 2012 and joined Tottenham in a \u00a36.8million deal six months later, before returning to south Wales in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, Swansea's player of the year for the past two seasons, has made 50 appearances for Iceland and played a key role in their run to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals.\n\nHis proposed move has dragged on for much of the summer, with Swansea initially valuing their star man at \u00a350million.\n\nFinally securing him now, at a slightly lower price, takes Everton's spending since the end of last season to over \u00a3130million.\n\nSigurdsson follows the likes of Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez as another multi-million-pound acquisition, while the club also secured the free transfer arrival of Wayne Rooney.\n\nSigurdsson, who scored nine goals and provided 13 assists in the league last term, pulled out of Swansea's pre-season tour to the United States after Everton's interest became clear.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training upon Swansea's return from the States but did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nSigurdsson will not feature in Thursday's Europa League play-off against Hajduk Split at Goodison Park, but Koeman indicated he could make his Everton debut in Monday's league clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\n\n\"He will not be involved (on Thursday),\" Koeman said. \"Maybe for Monday, I do not know. I need to talk to him and know what his physical state is. Let's wait to see how the fitness is.\"\n\nKoeman said Everton are waiting to learn the severity of an apparent hamstring problem suffered by Ross Barkley.\n\nReports have suggested Barkley, whose future with the club remains unclear, is facing six weeks out due to a hamstring tear.\n\nAsked about that, Koeman said: \"He stopped training, I think it was last Monday. It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests ... to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nMidfielder Barkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, appears destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a move to Tottenham, but Koeman said last week there had been no offers for the England international.\n\nKoeman, who has let midfielder Gareth Barry join West Brom, also signalled he would like to strengthen in the current transfer window beyond the capture of Sigurdsson.\n\nHe added on Wednesday: \"Still we are looking in two positions to make the squad even stronger than it is at this stage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hajduk boss Joan Carrillo has acknowledged Everton's strength ahead of Thursday's European clash, but feels there are weaknesses his team can take advantage of.\n\n\"All the games with this team, we play to win,\" Carrillo said at a pre-match press conference.\n\n\"I do not have another method or philosophy.\n\n\"I know Everton have a very good team. They are in the Premier League. And we are talking about signing one player for 50 million euros. But football is 11 against 11.\n\n\"We know the good things of Everton but also the bad things, and we have worked on this.\n\n\"I am an optimist.

Everton did not reveal the transfer details, saying only that it was a club record. Its previous highest fee was 31.8 million pounds, spent on Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the club,\" Sigurdsson told Everton's website.\n\nWayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez and Davy Klaassen are other attacking players to have joined Everton since the end of last season, as part of an outlay of around 135 million pounds ($175 million) on new players. The club recouped 75 million pounds ($97 million) in selling Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\n\"We lost with Lukaku 25 goals and we need more players than one to get that number of goals,\" Everton manager Ronaldo Koeman said. \"He (Sigurdsson) is that type of player. He knows the Premier League. He had really good seasons in Swansea, and he is in my opinion in his position one of the best in the Premier League.\"\n\nKoeman said Sigurdsson could feature for Everton in its league game at Manchester City on Monday.\n\nSince 2012, when he first moved to the Premier League, no player has scored more goals from direct free kicks than Sigurdsson (seven). He scored nine goals, and set up 13 more, for Swansea last season and scored a total of 30 in three seasons since returning to the Welsh club in 2014.\n\nHe was on loan at Swansea for the second half of the 2011-12 season before playing for Everton from 2012-14.\n\nGoalkeeper Jordan Pickford and defender Michael Keane have also moved to Everton in the offseason as the club looks to improve on its seventh-place finish from last season.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

In my opinion he is, in his position, one of the best in the Premier League.\"\n\nSigurdsson scored nine goals and provided 13 assists in the league last term for Swansea.\n\n\"Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the club,\" Sigurdsson told evertontv.\n\n\"This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction. The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\"\n\nKoeman, who has let midfielder Gareth Barry join West Brom, indicated he would still like to strengthen in the current transfer window beyond the capture of Sigurdsson.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Thursday's Europa League qualifying play-off first leg against Hajduk Split at Goodison Park, Koeman said: \"It isn't done. Still we are looking in two positions to make the squad even stronger than it is at this stage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Koeman said Everton are waiting to learn the severity of an apparent hamstring problem suffered by Ross Barkley.\n\nReports have suggested Barkley, whose future with the club remains unclear, is facing six weeks out due to a hamstring tear.\n\nAsked about that, Koeman said: \"He stopped training, I think it was last Monday. It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests ... to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nThe Dutchman added that there was \"no update\" in terms of the 23-year-old's \"situation\", and when asked if he was in his plans for the coming season, he said: ''I will wait until the end of August.''\n\nBarkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, has appeared destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a move to Tottenham, but Koeman said last week there had been no offers for the England midfielder.", "id": "9606396", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Ronald Koeman rates Everton new boy Gylfi Sigurdsson among Premier League elite", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/article36040686.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-becb2e25-6c3f-4967-b75b-8dc4c43b5a42_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 47, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "03:55:00"}

He spent the second half of last season back in La Liga at his home-town club Las Palmas scoring three times in 13 starts and three appearances off the bench.\n\nPSG were in talks with Serie A side Fiorentina over a two-year loan with an option to buy and they left the final decision to the player. But the 24-year-old has suspended talks with Fiorentina and entered into negotiations with Stoke. The Potters are expected to announce a deal over a season-long loan with the option to buy next summer.\n\nJese was once regarded as one of Real Madrid's brightest young prospects. But he was squeezed out of the side by the emergence of the so-called BBC - Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. He scored 13 goals in 64 La Liga games although only 14 of those appearances came as a member of the starting line-up. He averaged a goal for every 150 minutes on the pitch.\n\nIt was a similar story at PSG. Jese started only one league game for the French side last season and made eight appearances off the bench as he suffered from illness and injury.\n\nStoke boss Mark Hughes has come under fire for his transfer dealings so far with the \u00a37million spent on bringing Porto defender Bruno Martins Indi back to the club being the only money spent so far.\n\nThe Potters got off to a disappointing start on Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at Everton in their opening game of the new Premier League season.", "id": "9049297", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Jese Set To Complete Stoke City Transfer", "image": "http://www.footballgossip.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Stoke-City-badge-e1502704085173.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-14", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "245172", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Palmas", "label": {"eng": "Las Palmas de Gran Canaria"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "ACF Fiorentina"}, "id": "303117", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}, "id": "305102", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo"}, {"label": {"eng": "La Liga"}, "id": "305674", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga"}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}, "id": "309177", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "F.C.

Reuters\n\nThe former Tottenham player missed Swansea's pre-season tour of the United States while the talks dragged on.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training after Swansea's return from the States, but he did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nEverton were keen to tie up the swoop before the transfer window closes at the end of August and it is believed Swansea have at last agreed to sell their prize asset.\n\nThe 27-year-old is set to undergo a medical on Wednesday prior to joining Everton for what will be the Merseyside club's record transfer fee.\n\nEverton's previous highest fee was \u00a331 million for Romelu Lukaku, who was sold to Manchester United for a British record \u00a375 million during the close-season.\n\nKoeman has used the Lukaku windfall to fund a spending spree that will surpass \u00a3100 million once Sigurdsson signs.\n\nThe Dutchman re-signed Wayne Rooney from Manchester United, while also bringing in Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nSigurdsson scored nine goals and contributed 13 assists last season as Swansea climbed out of the relegation zone to ensure their survival.\n\nHis arrival may herald the imminent departure of England midfielder Ross Barkley, who has refused to sign a new contract at Everton and is keen to leave, with Tottenham among the clubs interested in his signature.\n\nSwansea boss Paul Clement will use the Sigurdsson cash to strengthen his squad with two or three new signings.\n\nManchester City striker Wilfried Bony, West Brom forward Nacer Chadli and Stoke midfielder Joe Allen have all been linked with Swansea.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 09:52 am | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 09:52 am\n\nTags :#Everton#Football#Gylfi

fact he scored nine league goals and had 13 assists as the club just avoided relegation from the Premier League last season.\n\nSigurdsson helped Swansea avoid relegation last season (Getty )\n\nOnly two other players, Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen, brought more goals and assists to their teams and Everton quickly targeted Sigurdsson as a key signing during a transfer window in which they have spent heavily.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen, Michael Keane, Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nBut that figure will now significantly rise with the capture of Sigurdsson, who can fill a variety of forward positions.\n\nSwansea hope to use the Sigurdsson cash by strengthening their squad with two or three players before the window closes.\n\nWilfried Bony, their former striker who appears surplus to requirements at Manchester City, and West Brom forward Nacer Chadli are both on Swansea's radar.\n\nAnd Swansea have also made an enquiry for their former midfielder Joe Allen, although Stoke insist the Wales international is not for sale.\n\nPA\n\nMore about: Gylfi Sigurdsson Swansea City Premier League Everton Reuse content", "id": "9365267", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Gylfi

Everton. Sigurdsson. Swansea. Koeman. Absolutely everyone. This has taken over six weeks to sort out but the end game is near and Swansea will at least get a huge profit as they bought Sigurdsson for Spurs in 2014 for $11.5 million, but did send Ben Davies and Michel Vorm in the opposite direction. Spurs also have a 10 percent sell-on clause in this deal.\n\nThe Icelandic playmaker scored nine goals and added 13 assists in the Premier League last season as he kept Swansea in the Premier League but the former Reading, Hoffenheim and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder will now link up with Koeman at Goodison Park.\n\nSigurdsson, Wayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez and Davy Klaassen will all be tasked with chipping in with double figures in terms of goals this season to counteract the departure of Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United for $96.5 million earlier this summer.\n\nIn his prime and ready to be a key piece of Everton's attacking unit for the foreseeable future, it appears that Sigurdsson has landed in the right place. This is a massive blow for Swansea but for Everton it's magnificent news.\n\nSigurdsson will have a large transfer fee hanging over his head and some suggest he prefers being a bigger fish in a smaller pond a la Swansea compared to his time at Tottenham.\n\nWe are about to find out if he can handle the pressure of leading a top four charge for the Toffees.

according to reports on Tuesday.\n\nSigurdsson has been high on Everton manager Ronald Koeman's wanted list for several months, but protracted negotiations over the transfer fee had delayed the Iceland international's move.\n\nThe former Tottenham player missed Swansea's pre-season tour of the United States while the talks dragged on.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training after Swansea's return from the States, but he did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nEverton were keen to tie up the swoop before the transfer window closes at the end of August and it is believed Swansea have at last agreed to sell their prize asset.\n\nThe 27-year-old is set to undergo a medical on Wednesday prior to joining Everton for what will be the Merseyside club's record transfer fee.\n\nEverton's previous highest fee was \u00a331 million for Romelu Lukaku, who was sold to Manchester United for a British record \u00a375 million during the close-season.\n\nKoeman has used the Lukaku windfall to fund a spending spree that will surpass \u00a3100 million once Sigurdsson signs.\n\nThe Dutchman re-signed Wayne Rooney from Manchester United, while also bringing in Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nSigurdsson scored nine goals and contributed 13 assists last season as Swansea climbed out of the relegation zone to ensure their survival.\n\nHis arrival may herald the imminent departure of England midfielder Ross Barkley, who has refused to sign a new contract at Everton and is keen to leave, with Tottenham among the clubs interested in his signature.\n\nSwansea boss Paul Clement will use the Sigurdsson cash to strengthen his squad with two or three new signings.\n\nManchester City striker Wilfried Bony, West Brom

I'm looking forward to getting to know my team-mates, the city, the training ground, the stadium and all the supporters.\"\n\nJoselu headed for Tyneside on Monday to discuss personal terms and undergo a medical as a protracted pursuit drew to a close, and he has now become compatriot Benitez's sixth summer signing.\n\nHe arrives at St James Park perhaps with something to prove after managing just four goals in 27 appearances in his first season in the Potteries following a \u00c2\u00a35.75million switch from Hannover during the summer of 2015.\n\nThe frontman was sent out on loan to Deportivo la Coruna last season and found the back of the net on six occasions while playing slightly fewer games.\n\nBenitez will hope he improves significantly on his return while on Tyneside, with Dwight Gayle and Aleksandar Mitrovic his only out-and-out strikers.\n\nHe has made recruitment on that front a priority since securing promotion back to the Premier League, but missed out on a loan deal for Chelsea's Tammy Abraham and has so far been thwarted with other targets - among them Arsenal's Lucas Perez - because of inflated asking prices and wages.\n\nBenitez said: \"We have known Joselu since his days at the Real Madrid academy, and we know that he has the potential to do well for us.\n\n\"Obviously he has experience of English football and the Premier League and that was another thing we took into consideration. We think if we can exploit his full potential he will be a good signing for us.\n\n\"He knows and accepts the challenge we've given him at Newcastle United and he's keen to come and fight for a position in the team.\"\n\nThe Newcastle boss and club owner Mike Ashley have each had their say on transfers in recent days to leave fans fearing a schism has developed, although with more than two weeks of the transfer window remaining, there is still room for manoeuvre.\n\nJoselu, who began his career with Celta Vigo and has also played for Real Madrid, Hoffenheim and Eintracht Frankfurt, joins Christian Atsu, Florian Lejeune, Jacob Murphy, Javier Manquillo and Mikel Merino in moving to St James' Park this summer.\n\nNewcastle face Huddersfield, with whom they emerged from the Sky Bet Championship last season, on Sunday.\n\nAP", "id": "9436909", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Joselu completes move to Newcastle from Stoke", "image":

The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\"\n\nSigurdsson said the prospect of working with Everton boss Ronald Koeman was one of the main reasons for switching to Goodison Park.\n\n\"He was a great player, one of the top players of his time,\" Sigurdsson added.\n\n\"Now he is a really good manager and his vision for Everton is clear. He has built up a really good squad here, with strong players, both young and experienced.\n\n\"This was a key factor for me. Ultimately, that is a dream of mine and everyone at this club. I know the supporters and players would agree with that.\"\n\nSigurdsson began his professional career in England with Reading and joined German side Hoffenheim in 2010.\n\nHe moved on loan to Swansea at the start of 2012 and joined Tottenham in a \u00a36.8million deal six months later, before returning to Swansea in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, Swansea's player of the year for the past two seasons, has made 50 appearances for Iceland and played a key role in their run to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals.\n\nHis proposed move has dragged on for much of the summer, with Swansea initially valuing their star man at \u00a350million.\n\nFinally securing him, at a lower price, takes Everton's spending since the end of last season to more than \u00a3130million. Sigurdsson follows Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez as another multi-million-pound acquisition, while the club also secured the free transfer of Wayne Rooney.", "id": "9661597", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Toffees break bank to sign Sigurdsson", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36039975.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Sigurdsson.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 14, "label": "dmoz/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 751, "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 822, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules"}], "time": "10:19:00"}

That is very often how a deal is made.\n\n\"We are at a critical stage of this situation and hope it's going to be resolved very quickly.\"\n\nSigurdsson's importance to Swansea was underlined by the fact he scored nine league goals and had 13 assists as the club just avoided relegation from the Premier League last season.\n\nOnly two other players, Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen, brought more goals and assists to their teams and Everton quickly targeted Sigurdsson as a key signing during a transfer window in which they have spent heavily.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00c2\u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen, Michael Keane, Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nBut that figure will now significantly rise with the capture of Sigurdsson, who can fill a variety of forward positions.\n\nSwansea hope to use the Sigurdsson cash by strengthening their squad with two or three players before the window closes.\n\nWilfried Bony, their former striker who appears surplus to requirements at Manchester City, and West Brom forward Nacer Chadli are both on Swansea's radar.\n\nAnd Swansea have also made an enquiry for their former midfielder Joe Allen, although Stoke insist the Wales international is not for sale.", "id": "9352645",

That is very often how a deal is made.\n\n\"We are at a critical stage of this situation and hope it's going to be resolved very quickly.\"\n\nSigurdsson's importance to Swansea was underlined by the fact he scored nine league goals and had 13 assists as the club just avoided relegation from the Premier League last season.\n\nOnly two other players, Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen, brought more goals and assists to their teams and Everton quickly targeted Sigurdsson as a key signing during a transfer window in which they have spent heavily.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen, Michael Keane, Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nBut that figure will now significantly rise with the capture of Sigurdsson, who can fill a variety of forward positions.\n\nSwansea hope to use the Sigurdsson cash by strengthening their squad with two or three players before the window closes.\n\nWilfried Bony, their former striker who appears surplus to requirements at Manchester City, and West Brom forward Nacer Chadli are both on Swansea's radar.\n\nAnd Swansea have also made an enquiry for their former midfielder Joe Allen, although Stoke insist the Wales international is not for sale.\n\nThe

Reuters picLONDON, Aug 16 -- Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson is due to complete a \u00a345 million (RM248.7 million) move to Everton from Premier League rivals Swansea City later today after he passed a medical, Everton manager Ronaldo Koeman announced.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8 million they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"I have seen the doctor and there is no problem,\" said Koeman at a press conference on the eve of their Europa League match with Hakjduk Split.\n\n\"Still he needs to sign, but I saw him in the blue!\"\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350 million.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340 million offer from 2016 champions Leicester City at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340 million with another \u00a35 million to follow, taking their summer spending under Koeman to over \u00a3140 million.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100 million so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375 million sale of Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out until October.\n\nKoeman was not very forthcoming when asked about Barkley's situation and his long-term future at the club.\n\n\"He stopped

Iceland international's move.\n\nLONDON: Everton have finally agreed a deal to sign Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson for around \u00a345 million ($57 million), according to reports on Tuesday.\n\nSigurdsson has been high on Everton manager Ronald Koeman's wanted list for several months, but protracted negotiations over the transfer fee had delayed the Iceland international's move.\n\nThe former Tottenham player missed Swansea's pre-season tour of the United States while the talks dragged on.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training after Swansea's return from the States, but he did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nEverton were keen to tie up the swoop before the transfer window closes at the end of August and it is believed Swansea have at last agreed to sell their prize asset.\n\nThe 27-year-old is set to undergo a medical on Wednesday prior to joining Everton for what will be the Merseyside club's record transfer fee.\n\nEverton's previous highest fee was \u00a331 million for Romelu Lukaku, who was sold to Manchester United for a British record \u00a375 million during the close-season.\n\nKoeman has used the Lukaku windfall to fund a spending spree that will surpass \u00a3100 million once Sigurdsson signs.\n\nThe Dutchman re-signed Wayne Rooney from Manchester United, while also bringing in Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nSigurdsson scored nine goals and contributed 13 assists last season as Swansea climbed out of the relegation zone to ensure their survival.\n\nHis arrival may herald the imminent departure of England midfielder Ross Barkley, who has refused to sign a new contract at Everton and is keen to leave, with Tottenham among the clubs interested in his signature.\n\nSwansea boss Paul Clement will use the Sigurdsson cash to strengthen his squad with two or three new signings.\n\nManchester City striker Wilfried Bony, West Brom forward Nacer Chadli and Stoke midfielder Joe Allen have all been linked with Swansea.", "id": "9375867", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Everton set to seal Sigurdsson swoop, reports", "image":

"Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson is due to complete a \u00a345 million ($58m, 49.4m euros) move to Everton from Premier League rivals Swansea City later on Wednesday after he passed a medical, Everton manager Ronald Koeman announced.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8 million they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"I have seen the doctor and there is no problem,\" said Koeman at a press conference on the eve of their Europa League match with Hakjduk Split.\n\n\"Still he needs to sign, but I saw him in the blue!\"\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350 million.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340 million offer from 2016 champions Leicester City at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340 million with another \u00a35 million to follow, taking their summer spending under Koeman to over \u00a3140 million.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100 million so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375 million sale of Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\n\"We worked a long time to get this deal in and he was one of the key players to bring in,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"We knew we would lose (Romelu) Lukaku for this season, with that we lost 25 goals, and we need players who will bring in productivity to the team.\n\n\"He is that type of player, with a lot of productivity.\"\n\nEverton could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is currently injured and likely to be out until October.\n\nKoeman was not very forthcoming when asked about Barkley's situation and his long-term future at the club.\n\n\"He stopped training last Monday,\" said Koeman.\n\n\"It looks like a hamstring injury but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.\n\n\"I will wait until the end of August,\" he added when asked about Barkley's future at the club.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson

Ronald Koeman's side will pay an initial fee of \u00a340m and two \u00a32.5m add-ons.\n\nSigurdsson's arrival on Merseyside means Koeman's side has now spent \u00a3144m this summer, as the club look to challenge for a Champions League place in the Dutchman's second season.\n\nEverton have completed the signing of Gylfi Sigurdsson for a club-record \u00a345million\n\n\u1f440 | Look who's here... pic.twitter.com/iAcnN5SSn4 -- Everton (@Everton)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nAfter completing his move, he said: 'Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the club.\n\n'This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction. The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\n\n'For myself, I would like to score as many goals as possible and create as many goals for my team-mates as I can. These are my targets.\n\n'But it is always the same thing: as long as the team is winning I will be more than happy.'\n\nSigurdsson has been named Swansea's player of the year in each of the previous two seasons\n\nSix of Everton's top seven biggest ever transfer fees have now been paid by Farhad Moshiri\n\nLeicester City also made a \u00a340m offer but Sigurdsson had his heart set on a move to Goodison.\n\nHe refused to travel to the USA for Swansea's pre-season tour and missed their friendly with Birmingham after declaring he was not in the right frame of mind.\n\nSigurdsson scored nine goals and created 13 more last season, and has been named Swansea's player of the year in each of the previous two seasons.\n\nIndeed, he swept the board last campaign winning players' player of the year for the second season running, supporters' player of the year and away supporters' player of the year.\n\nThough Swansea had publicly declared they wanted \u00a350million for him, discussions had centred around the \u00a340m mark with two proposals rejected before Tuesday's breakthrough.\n\nThe Iceland midfielder will undergo a medical on Wednesday at the Merseyside club\n\nSigurdsson replaces Romelu Lukaku as Everton's record signing following his move in 2014\n\nSigurdsson - who covered more ground than any other Premier League player last season (433km) - is expected to be unveiled to the Goodison crowd ahead of Thursday's Europa League tie with Hajduk Split.\n\nThe former Tottenham midfielder has not played a match of any description since he captained Swansea in a friendly defeat at Barnet on 12 July, so it will take some time for the player to gain match fitness.\n\nSigurdsson has maintained a dignified silence during the lengthy transfer negotiations between the two clubs but he is now finally Everton's record signing, beating the \u00a331.8m they paid Chelsea for striker Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\nThey have enjoyed a productive transfer window, re-signing Wayne Rooney from Manchester United and spending a potential \u00a330m each on centre back Michael Keane and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\n\nMidfielder Davy Klaassen also arrived from Ajax for \u00a323.6m and striker Sandro Ramirez from Malaga for \u00a35.2m.\n\nEverton midfielder Ross Barkley is facing the prospect of six weeks out with a torn hamstring\n\nThe player is widely expected to leave Goodison Park this summer, with Tottenham interested\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE'S MOST CREATIVE MIDFIELDERS SINCE 2014-15 SEASON Rank Player Goals Assists Goals + Assists 1 Christian Eriksen 24 32 56 2 Gylfi Sigurdsson 27 26 53 3 Eden Hazard 34 17 51 3 Mesut Ozil 18 33 51 5 Cesc Fabregas 13 37 50 6 Sadio Mane 35 14 49 7 Riyad Mahrez 27 18 45 = Dele Alli 29 16 45 9 David Silva 18 26 44 10 Philippe Coutinho 26 17 43 11 Kevin De Bruyne 13 27 40 12 Dusan Tadic 14 24 38 13 Ross Barkley 15 18 33\n\nSigurdsson's arrival could hasten the departure of Ross Barkley, who has refused to sign a new contract with his boyhood club.\n\nThe England midfielder has been linked with a move to Tottenham but Everton are yet to receive an official offer and his exit has been complicated after scans revealed he tore a hamstring in training.\n\nBarkley is facing six weeks out with a Grade Three tear which could put paid to hopes of a move away this summer. But Everton can look forward to a more creative midfielder.\n\nSigurdsson has either scored or assisted 53 goals since the start of the 2014-15 season. Only Tottenham's Christian Eriksen boasts a high number in that time, with Barkley having been involved in 20 fewer goals than the Icelandic.\n\nEVERTON'S BUSY SUMMER TRANSFER WINDOW\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson has completed a \u00a345million move from Swansea to Everton - a deal that has added to what has been a considerably busy summer for the Toffees in terms of recruitment.\n\nHere, Sportsmail look at the significant signings manager Ronald Koeman has made - other than Sigurdsson - to reshape his squad since the end of last season.\n\nJORDAN PICKFORD\n\nPickford joined from Sunderland in June for an initial \u00a325million which could rise to \u00a330million with add-ons, a record fee for a British goalkeeper. Koeman will hope the 23-year-old solves the problem of inconsistent goalkeeping which dogged the Toffees last season.\n\nMICHAEL KEANE\n\nKoeman needed to freshen up an ageing defence and 24-year-old England centre-back Keane, signed from Burnley for a fee which could also rise to \u00a330million, was identified as the long-term leader at the back, with Ashley Williams and club captain Phil Jagielka turning 33 and 35 respectively in August.\n\nCUCO MARTINA\n\nAnother boost for Everton in terms of defensive options. Martina had been signed by Koeman for Southampton in 2015 and the Curacao right-back reunited with his old boss this summer following the expiry of his contract with the Saints.\n\nDAVY KLAASSEN\n\nThe Holland midfielder, previously Ajax captain, was brought in for \u00a323.5million to provide more creativity and goals from midfield, being touted as a replacement for Ross Barkley, whose future at Everton remains in doubt.\n\nSANDRO RAMIREZ\n\nThe former Barcelona striker was signed from Malaga after Everton triggered his release clause in July. Fourteen goals in LaLiga last season indicates he should add more firepower to a side who were heavily reliant on the now-departed Romelu Lukaku.\n\nWAYNE ROONEY\n\nRooney made an emotional return to his boyhood club in July, rejoining from Manchester United for an undisclosed fee 13 years after going the other way.\n\nThere will be great interest in how the 31-year-old, United and England's record goalscorer, fares back at his old side - and scoring the winner on Saturday in his first Premier League match since the move certainly made for a good start.", "id": "9546212", "details": {},

He (Sigurdsson) knows the Premier League and he had a few really good seasons at Swansea and in my opinion, in the Premier League he's one of the best in his position.\"\n\nSo it's clear to see Koeman wants more from his midfield men this season. A lot more.\n\nThe Blues have a wealth of midfield options in addition to their new recruits, with the likes of Morgan Schneiderlin, Idrissa Gueye and 19-year-old Tom Davies all impressing last term.\n\nBut with combined transfer fees of around \u00a370m, there will be huge pressure on Klaassen and Sigurdsson - more so the latter who is now the Toffees' record signing - to deliver the goods in their debut seasons on Merseyside.\n\nNot that Sigurdsson will be phased by that.\n\nAfter all, he helped guide Iceland into the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, and in the following season scored 10 goals in all competitions as well as registering 13 Premier League assists to drag the Swans to safety under Paul Clement.\n\nAnd those who have watched from the stands of the Liberty with the number 23 stamped on the back of their now probably discarded shirts will tell you, Sigurdsson is far more than a one-season wonder. He did the business in every campaign for the Swans.\n\nIn the last three Premier League seasons, Sigurdsson scored more free-kick goals (six) than any other player and was involved in 53 goals, with Christian Eriksen (54) being the only midfielder to better his tally over that period.\n\nHe has also chalked up 26 assists in England's top flight, with Cesc Fabregas, Mesut Ozil, Christian Eriksen and Kevin de Bruyne being the only other midfielders to achieve more.\n\nAnd when it comes to hitting the back of the net, Sigurdsson has averaged nine goals a season in the league since signing a permanent deal with Swansea in 2014, equal with Leicester man Riyad Mahrez while Tottenham's Dele Alli is the only midfield man to have managed more (28).\n\nIt's all music to the ears of the Everton faithful, and puts a huge tick in the productivity and creativity boxes on Koeman's wish list.\n\nOn top of all of those impressive stats, Sigurdsson also clocked up 433 kilometres (269 miles) in the Premier League last season, more than any other player, something that will be hugely pleasing for Koeman and Everton's fitness coach Jan Kluitenberg.\n\nAre there any concerns? Following his less successful spell at Tottenham, perhaps there are a few minor worries.\n\nBut while it didn't work as Sigurdsson would have hoped with Spurs, Mauricio Pochettino admitted his regret in allowing the \"perfect\" Iceman to leave White Hart Lane to sign a permanent deal with the Swans after having a loan spell with the club two years earlier.\n\nSo as far as the future is concerned, it's been some time since there was so much excitement at Everton given that they have splashed the cash this summer while a move to a new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock is also on the horizon.\n\nAnd in Sigurdsson, the Swansea faithful will testify that Everton have a real gem on their hands, and crucially, a player that can help take them to the next level under Koeman.", "id": "9723693",

We don't sign one player who will score 25 goals but we need several players around our striker to get that number.\n\n\"He is one of those productive players which he has shown at Swansea and also in the past.\n\n\"He can play in different positions.

temporary deal with the Potters after deciding to test himself in the Premier League.\n\nJese had already agreed to link up for Fiorentina for a two-year spell as a replacement for Juventus-bound Federico Bernardeschi.\n\nBut the Spain international apparently performed a dramatic U-turn at the last minute and is now determined to complete a move to Stoke as soon possible.\n\nJese only arrived at PSG a year ago from Real Madrid in a deal worth \u00a322.5million.\n\nBut he struggled to make an impression under Unai Emery and returned to Spain with minnows Las Palmas at the start of 2017.\n\nHowever, Jese's form at the Santiago Bernabeu has not been forgotten by a number of big European clubs.\n\nAnd Fiorentina reckoned they'd done enough to secure his signature before the player changed his mind at the final moment.\n\nIt now means Mark Hughes is set to add to his forward line after losing Marko Arnautovic to West Ham.\n\nJese's versatility means he can be deployed in a

"storyUri": "eng-3364130", "body": "Iceland midfielder is due to complete a \u00a345 million move to Everton\n\nIceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson is due to complete a \u00a345 million move to Everton from Premier League rivals Swansea City later on Wednesday after he passed a medical, Everton manager Ronaldo Koeman announced.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8 million they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"I have seen the doctor and there is no problem,\" said Koeman at a press conference on the eve of their Europa League match with Hakjduk Split.\n\n\"Still he needs to sign, but I saw him in the blue!\"\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350 million.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340 million offer from 2016 champions Leicester City at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340 million with another \u00a35 million to follow, taking their summer spending under Koeman to over \u00a3140 million.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100 million so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375 million sale of Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out until October.\n\nKoeman was not very forthcoming when asked about Barkley's situation and his long-term future at the club.\n\n\"He stopped training last Monday,\" said Koeman.\n\n\"It looks like a hamstring injury but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.\n\n\"I will wait until the end of August,\" he added when asked about Barkley's future at the club.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists amongst midfielders in the Premier League last season behind Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.", "id": "9532958", "details": {}, "date":

the forward publicly accusing his old club of a lack of ambition\n\n\"I wanted to join West Ham because for me it's a bigger, more ambitious club,\" he said upon arrival at the London Stadium.\n\nBut

bigger, more ambitious club than Stoke\", the Potters' social media account went on to define the word 'ambition' before detailing Jese's past clubs and honours, which include two Champions League titles.\n\nThe Spaniard follows Darren Fletcher, Kurt Zouma, Maxim Choupa-Moting, Bruno Martins Indi and Josh Tymon in checking-in at the bet365 Stadium this summer.\n\nHe spent nine seasons with Real Madrid, scoring 12 goals in 62 La Liga appearances, and was part of their Champions League winning squads in 2014 and 2016.\n\nHis progress was disrupted by a serious knee injury but last summer he

us.\n\n\"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League.\n\n\"His pedigree speaks for itself

Little did they know they would come 12 months later.\n\nAnd he didn't really deliver?\n\nHis presentation went well enough. His girlfriend Aurah Ruiz took centre-stage at the Parc des Princes unveiling.\n\nThe images of the couple, along with the video of the rap single 'Yo Sabia' that he had recorded under the alias Jey M made the headlines, but when the glitz and the glamour faded the goals never came in the first half of a very disappointing season.\n\nRuiz is frequently seen on Jese Instagrmam and she took centre-stage at the Parc des Princes\n\nAll his own fault or mitigating circumstances?\n\nPSG boss Unai Emery can be a difficult coach to get along with and he had his own problems adjusting to life in Ligue 1.\n\nThere was early friction between the two with the player feeling that as the big summer signing he should have been treated a little better.\n\nIf being giving a star-spangled welcome in Paris swelled his ego he will have been humbled by the subsequent loan move to Spanish mid-table side Las Palmas, so he will perhaps arrive a more level-headed individual at Stoke.\n\nJese will now test his qualities in the Premier League with a loan deal at Stoke City\n\nWhat happened at Las Palmas?\n\nHe was returning to his boyhood club. There was an over-eagerness to please on the pitch at the start and he had to endure a disastrous debut missing an open goal in the defeat to lowly Granada by actually turning a perfect cross away from goal instead of passing it into an empty net.\n\nThings improved, but not by much and he finished up with three goals in 16 games. Las Palmas were never going to have the money to keep him on loan for another season anyway.\n\nThe 24-year-old failed to make the grade at Real under Zinedine Zidane but he is still ambitious\n\nAnother bad move then?\n\nLas Palmas don't aspire to much more than mid-table safety and the club had already obtained that before he played his first game. Coach Quique Seti\u00e9n didn't really want another forward. He felt it was the defence that needed sorting out. He was also in a contract dispute with the club and poised to leave. All in all it wasn't the greatest environment for Jese to get back to his best.\n\nThe Spaniard has spent just one season at the French club following his Real Madrid exit\n\nWhen he was at his best, just how good was he?\n\nHe shone for Spain right from under-16 level, going on to win the Under-19 European Championship in 2012 finishing as top scorer. He was outstanding in Real Madrid's youth team too, first coming through as a winger but then scoring a record 22 goals for the B-team at a time when they were playing in Spain's highly competitive second division.\n\nDespite having Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale ahead of him in the first team he managed, against all the odds, to break through under Carlo Ancelotti in 2013-14. There were even calls for his inclusion in Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad for the 2014 World Cup.\n\nJese broke through at Real under Carlo Ancelotti but he soon found himself out of favour\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\nOn February 18, 2014, in the last-16 Champions League game against Schalke he tore cruciate ligaments in his right knee and had to kiss goodbye his World Cup dream and eight months of football. If he debuts on Saturday he will come up against the player involved in his awful injury, Arsenal's new signing Sead Kolasinac.\n\nTerrible injury, terrible timing\n\nHe was out for 258 days but his head never dropped and he was welcomed back by a Real Madrid dressing room who had nicknamed him 'Bichito' a diminutive version of 'Bicho' Ronaldo's moniker meaning 'bug' but suggesting something more along the lines of 'force of nature'.\n\nHe showed he had got over the injury when Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane picked him for a Champions League game against Roma in the Olympic Stadium. He scored and gave full-back Lucas Digne (now of Barcelona), a torrid time.\n\nBut the competition was tougher than ever at Madrid and PSG seemed like a good idea when they came calling last year.\n\nJese is likely to fill the void left by Marko Arnautovic as part of a three-pronged attack at Stoke\n\nWhere will he play for Stoke? And what should we call him?\n\nIn a three-pronged attack he would play as a wide forward. And because Rodriguez is as common as Smith in Spain he has always answered to Jes\u00e9. That's Jesay no Jessie. Stoke supporters will come up with something.\n\nOverall should they be positive?\n\nHe's got genuine talent and with Mark Hughes coaching him he can become a much more complete forward. The Stoke fans will no doubt get behind him and stick with him in a way that he will not have experienced in France or Spain. It's easy to dismiss him as an airhead busy wasting his talent.\n\nBut behind the rap videos and glamorous girlfriend he has shown that as well as being a character, he does also have character. If he came back from a career threatening injury then he can come back from some bad career choices.\n\nAnd if he concentrates solely on his football then linking up with Hughes could be the making of him. If thing go well we could see Peter Crouch in Jes\u00e9's next video.\n\nJese is a character who will bring a new dimension to a physical Stoke side this coming term", "id": "9439743", "details": {},

"eng-3364130", "body": "LONDON - Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson is due to complete a \u00a345 million move to Everton from Premier League rivals Swansea City later on Wednesday after he passed a medical, Everton manager Ronaldo Koeman announced.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five-year contract worth \u00a3100 000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8 million they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"I have seen the doctor and there is no problem,\" said Koeman at a press conference on the eve of their Europa League match with Hakjduk Split.\n\n\"Still he needs to sign, but I saw him in the blue!\"\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350m.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340m offer from 2016 champions Leicester City at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340m with another \u00a35m to follow, taking their summer spending under Koeman to over \u00a3140m.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375m sale of Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out until October.\n\nKoeman was not very forthcoming when asked about Barkley's situation and his long-term future at the club.\n\n\"He stopped training last Monday,\" said Koeman.\n\n\"It looks like a hamstring injury, but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.\n\n\"I will wait until the end of August,\" he added when asked about Barkley's future at the club.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists amongst midfielders in the Premier League last season behind Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.\n\nAFP", "id": "9522391", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Sigurdsson passes medical for Everton move | IOL Sport", "image":

Gylfi Sigurdsson is due to complete a \u00a345 million ($58m, \u20ac49.4m) move to Everton from Premier League rivals Swansea City on Wednesday after he passed a medical, Everton manager Ronaldo Koeman announced.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five-year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8 million they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\n\"I have seen the doctor and there is no problem,\" said Koeman at a press conference on the eve of their Europa League match with Hakjduk Split.\n\n\"Still he needs to sign, but I saw him in the blue!\"\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the US and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350 million.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340 million offer from 2016 champions Leicester City at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340 million with another \u00a35 million to follow, taking their summer spending under Koeman to over \u00a3140 million.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100 million so far in recruiting former favorite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375 million sale of Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out until October.\n\nKoeman was not very forthcoming when asked about Barkley's situation and his long-term future at the club. \"He stopped training last Monday,\" said Koeman.\n\n\"It looks like a hamstring injury but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.\n\n\"I will wait until the end of August,\" he added when asked about Barkley's future at the club.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists among midfielders in the Premier League last season behind Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.", "id": "9600598", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Sigurdsson passes medical, set for record move to Everton", "image":

I need to talk to him and know what his physical state is.

It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nThe Dutchman added that there was \"no update\" in terms of the 23-year-old's \"situation\", and when asked if he was in his plans for the coming season, he said: \"I will wait until the end of August.\"\n\nBarkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, appears destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a move

Premier League rivals Swansea later on Wednesday if he passes a medical, British media reported.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8m they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350m.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340m offer one from 2016 champions Leicester at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340m with another \u00a35m to follow, taking their close season spending under Ronald Koeman to over \u00a3140m.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375m sale of striker Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out till October.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists amongst midfielders in the Premier League last season behind

Reuters\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350 million.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340 million offer one from 2016 champions Leicester at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340 million with another \u00a35 million to follow, taking their close season spending under Ronald Koeman to over \u00a3140 million.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100 million so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330 million), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6 million), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330 million), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375 million sale of striker Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out till October.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists amongst midfielders in the Premier League last season behind Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 16, 2017 03:40 pm | Updated Date: Aug 16, 2017 03:40 pm\n\nTags :#Davy

In my opinion he is, in his position, one of the best in the Premier League.\"\n\nSigurdsson, who scored nine goals and provided 13 assists in the league last term, pulled out of Swansea's pre-season tour to the United States after Everton's interest became clear.\n\nHe rejoined first-team training upon Swansea's return from the States but he did not figure in their Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday.\n\nSigurdsson will not feature in Thursday's contest at Goodison Park, but Koeman has indicated he could make his Everton debut in Monday's league clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\n\n\"He will not be involved tomorrow,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"Maybe for Monday, I do not know. I need to talk to him and know what his physical state is. Let's wait to see how the fitness is.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Koeman has said Everton are waiting to learn the severity of an apparent hamstring problem suffered by Ross Barkley.\n\nReports have suggested Barkley, whose future with the club remains unclear, is facing six weeks out due to a hamstring tear.\n\nAsked about that, Koeman said: \"He stopped training, I think it was last Monday. It looks like a hamstring injury but we need to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is. We need to wait.\"\n\nThe Dutchman added that there was \"no update\" in terms of the 23-year-old's \"situation\", and when asked if he was in his plans for the coming season, he said: \"I will wait until the end of August.\"\n\nBarkley, who is entering the last year of his contract, appears destined to leave the club having turned down the offer of a new deal.\n\nHe has been linked with a move to Tottenham, but Koeman said last week there had been no offers for the England international.", "id": "9510741", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Gylfi Sigurdsson close to signing for Everton - Ronald Koeman", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/article36038613.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-69d0daa2-bd67-464f-ac0d-321810283cb4_I1.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 47, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "15:33:00"}

Ramirez\n\nIceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson is due to complete a \u00a345 million ($58m, 49.4m euros) move to Everton from Premier League rivals Swansea later on Wednesday if he passes a medical, British media reported.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five year contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the \u00a331.8m they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted \u00a350m.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported \u00a340m offer one from 2016 champions Leicester at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340m with another \u00a35m to follow, taking their close season spending under Ronald Koeman to over \u00a3140m.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375m sale of striker Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out till October.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists amongst midfielders in the Premier League last season behind Manchester City's Kevin de Bruyne and Tottenham's Christian

Swansea had initially placed a \u00a350m price tag on the talismanic playmaker during the embryonic stages of the summer transfer window, but Everton were reluctant to go so high for the former Tottenham attacker, who dragged Paul Clement's side away from the relegation mire last summer.\n\nClement said there was a \"difference of opinion\" over the fee last weekend but a deal was finally agreed on Tuesday, with Everton paying a set amount of \u00a340m with \u00a35m potentially to be worth in add-ons.\n\nKoeman has admired Sigurdsson for a long time and made him his top target this summer, and is delighted to have finally captured the former Reading academy product: \"I'm really happy because the Board and especially our Chairman, Bill Kenwright, did everything to get him. It took some time but finally we have signed the player,\" Koeman told evertontv.\n\n\"In my opinion, in his position he is one of the best in the Premier League. We have the player here and that's really good for the team.\"\n\nEverton supporters may have to wait to see Sigurdsson make his debut for the club. The talented forward played just 45 minutes of football during pre-season and was omitted from Swansea's pre-season tour of America due to the speculation that surrounded him.\n\nSigurdsson may play some part against Manchester City on Monday, but for now is just delighted to have finally joined Everton: \"Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the club,\" Sigurdsson told evertontv.\n\n\"This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction. The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\n\n\"For myself, I would like to score as many goals as possible and create as many goals for my teammates as I can. These are my targets. But it is always the same thing: as long as the team is winning I will be more than happy.\"\n\nSigurdsson is Everton twelfth signing of the summer, but Koeman is keen to bring a couple more players before the end of the transfer window.

And while the additions of Kurt Zouma on loan and Bruno Martins Indi on a permanent deal are nice ones, they're not the most glamorous.\n\nBut it appears that Stoke have been very aware of the talk surrounding them as the Premier League heads into its second week, and addressed it directly while announcing a very exciting new signing - Jese Rodriguez.\n\nWell that showed all those pundits, didn't it?

While Everton fans grew tired of waiting and, in some cases, started to question whether Sigurdsson was really worth all that hassle and money, the mood shifted in Swansea once it became clear that the Icelander wanted out and that any significant signings would not be made until the first instalment of the biggest transfer fee in their history had been handed over.\n\nAs for Sigurdsson, the man who covered more ground than any other Premier League player last season, 433km to be exact, watched the new season start without him and has not played a match of any description since he wore the captain's armband in a friendly defeat at Barnet on 12 July, when Swansea assumed that he would be boarding the flight to the United States the next day for the club's pre-season tour. Sigurdsson had other ideas and informed the club at the team hotel in London, shortly before they were due to depart for the airport, that he was staying at home.\n\nThat decision took Paul Clement by surprise and went down badly with Swansea's supporters. It would be naive to think that Sigurdsson's actions were all of his own doing - the mechanics behind a transfer are a bit more complicated than that - and it is also true that plenty of players have behaved in the same way to force through a move. With Sigurdsson, however, Swansea thought it would be different.\n\nA quiet man in the dressing room, Sigurdsson was always seen as a model professional, inspiring those around him with his performances and commanding the respect of players and staff with his dedication on the training ground. He was something of a reluctant hero at Swansea - an image stays in the mind of Sigurdsson on the final day of last season, during the players' lap of honour, being cajoled by a few of his team-mates to step forward and acknowledge the supporters that were singing his name to the tune of Give it Up by KC and The Sunshine Band.\n\nFour days earlier Sigurdsson had pretty much swept the board at the club's end-of-season awards dinner, winning players' player of the year for the second season running, supporters' player of the year and away supporters' player of the year. By the end of the evening he looked embarrassed to be spending so much time on the stage.\n\nKev Johns, the brilliant compere and a fanatical Swansea supporter, saw each on-stage interview as an opportunity to try - tongue-in-cheek - to talk Sigurdsson into staying, at one point jumping on the player's description of Swansea as a \"special club\". With a glint in his eye, Johns said: \"You do know it's not like that everywhere else.\" Sigurdsson laughed along with the rest of the guests, yet deep down most people at the Liberty Stadium that night would have suspected that his time in Wales was up.\n\nCertainly plenty of the players thought that was the case after another superb season from a man whose contribution over the past three years at Swansea shines through in the company that he has been keeping when it comes to the statistics that really matter. Sigurdsson has been directly involved in 53 Premier League goals since the start of the 2014-15 season, which as a midfielder is second only to Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.\n\nTo provide a bit of context, next on that list after Sigurdsson is Mesut \u00d6zil, then Eden Hazard, followed by Cesc F\u00e0bregas, Sadio Man\u00e9, Riyad Mahrez, Dele Alli, David Silva and Philippe Coutinho - you get the picture. Ross Barkley, for what it is worth, is down in 13th place. The Everton midfielder, and the man that Sigurdsson has effectively been bought to replace at Goodison Park, has been involved in 20 fewer league goals over the same period.\n\nNow take into consideration the fact that Sigurdsson has been scoring and creating all those goals in a team that has spent the last two seasons fighting relegation and it becomes a little easier to understand why Swansea put a \u00a350m valuation on his head, especially given the sort of transfer fees that have been paid elsewhere in the Premier League this summer and, in some cases, for players that are nothing like as influential.\n\nThere is a misconception about Sigurdsson that he is no more than a set-piece expert. Sigurdsson, without question, is brilliant in dead-ball situations. Every direct free-kick within shooting distance carried a huge sense of expectation at Swansea and the statistics covering the previous three seasons show that he is comfortably top of the pile for chances created from set-plays (106, more than twice as many as any Everton player), yet the 27-year-old has much more to his game.\n\nAn intelligent player who likes to roam and link play, Sigurdsson is at his best when he finds pockets of space to open teams up with a first-time pass or clever backheel. That bright football brain makes up for the fact that he lacks pace: he is, by his own admission, \"not the kind of player who is going to get the ball and run past the full-back\". For that reason Sigurdsson needs to play through the middle as a No10, where he can have the biggest impact on the game.\n\nAt Tottenham Hotspur, where Sigurdsson spent two seasons after joining from Hoffenheim in 2012, he was frustrated with how much time he spent on either the left wing or the bench. He made 58 Premier League appearances across two seasons with Spurs, yet was on the pitch from start to finish in only nine of those matches. Tottenham's loss ended up being Swansea's gain, as Mauricio Pochettino admitted last season. The Spurs manager said Sigurdsson would have been a \"perfect player\" for him at White Hart Lane, yet he never really got the chance to work with a midfielder who was in his starting lineup for a pre-season friendly against Seattle Sounders only to be sold 40 minutes before the game kicked off. Pochettino, who had only just taken over as manager, received a call from the Tottenham board to say that Ben Davies was joining from Swansea and Sigurdsson was going the other way.\n\nOn the back of an impressive loan spell a few seasons earlier, Swansea knew what they were getting with Sigurdsson in every sense. Managers, coaches and players came to admire his work ethic in training as much as his goals and assists on a match day. Team-mates would talk about the way the goalkeeper coach would look at Sigurdsson on a morning at the training ground and ask: \"Today?\" More often than not Sigurdsson would give a nod back, which meant that he wanted to do some extra shooting once the session had finished.\n\nSigurdsson preferred to do that work away from the rest of the outfield players so that there were no distractions. He would spend hours striking the ball from the edge of the area with both feet - naturally stronger on his right, he scored some terrific goals for Swansea with his left, and got his reward in those headline statistics. \"There is no luck involved,\" Jack Cork said at the end of last season, reflecting on the superb free-kick that Sigurdsson scored against Manchester United to earn Swansea a point in April. \"Gylfi spends ages practising. He works so hard.\"\n\nSigurdsson, in short, was a man who could do no wrong in the eyes of everyone at the club and few at the Liberty Stadium would have begrudged him a big move this summer. In truth, it was something of a surprise when Swansea managed to tie him down to a four-year contract 12 months earlier. Yet the way things were handled after the Barnet game last month left a bitter taste for some Swansea fans.\n\nIt is a shame in many ways, especially given the legacy that Sigurdsson could have left at Swansea, although there is nothing be gained by dwelling on the past. While Everton focus on getting their club-record signing match fit and integrated as soon as possible, Swansea need to move quickly to reinvest the money wisely. Time will tell whether all the haggling was worthwhile.", "id": "9455569", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Gylfi Sigurdsson: tireless perfectionist will be worth the wait for Everton |

The Sigurdsson deal will take Ronald Koeman's spending this summer to \u00a3131m, says the Daily Telegraph.\n\nAside from Sigurdsson and Pickford, the Toffees have made several other high profile signings this summer, including Michael Keane and Davy Klaassen, while Wayne Rooney has returned to his boyhood club on a free transfer.\n\nSwansea appeared resigned to the idea of selling Sigurdsson last week. Manager Paul Clement left him out of the squad that drew 0-0 with Southampton, says The Times.\n\nSigurdsson's arrival could spell the end for Ross Barkley at Everton but observers have mixed opinions about what he brings to the Toffees.\n\nThe transfer fee may at first seem like a \"stupid amount of money\", says Pat Nevin of the BBC. \"But if he goes and gets you into the Champions League, well that will not seem like a daft amount of money.\n\n\"There's a few of us out there who think this guy's extra special and can give you that one thing, that one piece of class that you need to make yourself different from the rest.\n\n\"Sigurdsson gets a game wherever he goes and looks perfectly good in any team you put him in. He's a fabulous player and I think he single-handedly kept his club up last season.\"\n\nBut Tom Ley of the US website Deadspin is less convinced.

The Toffees identified Gylfi Sigurdsson as their top transfer target early in the summer and never relented in that pursuit, despite Swansea City rejecting multiple bids. And on Wednesday, Everton finally got their man for an incredible \u00a345 million transfer fee -- by far a club record.\n\nSigurdsson is the player who has received the most credit for keeping Swansea City in the Premier League last season. He recorded nine goals and 13 assists in league play, with many of both coming from set pieces.\n\nEverton has some fantastic defenders, athletes, ball-retainers, and finishers, but is currently lacking in the quality service department. Ronald Koeman believes Sigurdsson is his team's missing piece, and will expect him to rack up assists for the next few years.\n\nIt's likely that Sigurdsson will slot into Everton's starting XI on the right wing, but he's a versatile player who will likely line up in multiple spots based on the form and fitness of other players. Sigurdsson is a very two-footed player, and he's played on both wings, as a No. 10, and in a three-man midfield for both Tottenham Hotspur and Swansea City.\n\nThat versatility makes Sigurdsson an especially useful pickup for Everton given their set of youngsters currently fighting for playing time. Tom Davies is a central midfielder, Dominic Calvert-Lewin has played as an attacking midfielder and winger, and Ademola Lookman has played as a winger and forward. None is clearly head and shoulders above the others, but any of them could make a big leap forward and cement their place in the starting XI sometime this season.\n\nNo matter which player makes that leap, Sigurdsson can fit into a lineup with them. He doesn't block anyone, and no one blocks him. Sigurdsson's future position might be defined by which one of those players makes the most progress in the first half of the season.\n\nAfter years of frugal spending by chairman Bill Kenwright, Evertonians will be thrilled that new owner Farhad Moshiri was willing to spend whatever it took to get his manager's top transfer target. So if you're an Everton supporter who can't be bothered with worrying about the club's finances, stop reading here and don't let me drag you down. Celebrate and be happy. This is an incredible day for you.\n\nAre they gone? OK -- this is a bad deal. Sigurdsson is a good player who will slot into Everton's starting XI right away and make them better, but he will not make them better enough to get into the top four. He is not the difference between seventh and fourth. Everton had the seventh-best squad in the Premier League before signing Sigurdsson, and after signing him they have ... the seventh-best squad in the Premier League.\n\nThis is the predicament that clubs outside of the rich top-six set face -- there is no one signing, or even half-dozen signings, they can realistically make to bridge the gap. The only way to do it is, as Tottenham has, slowly but surely increase your commercial revenue while hitting the lottery on some very cheap signings or academy products that turn into superstars.\n\nSigurdsson is turning 28 in less than a month, so he has very little resale value. He's signing a contract with wages big enough that no smaller club will want to match if he is anything less than a superstar for Everton. Players like this should only be signed if a team has reason to believe that they are one player away from a Champions League place/league title, or if their revenue is so high that the loss they take on the player will be irrelevant. Neither applies to Everton.\n\nA team that nearly got relegated last season, and who has done very little to improve this summer, just sold their best player by several orders of magnitude. Yikes.\n\nSwansea now has two weeks to spend \u00a345 million wisely enough that it gives them one of the 17 best squads in the Premier League. Given that their transfer window was a disaster last summer as well, this seems unlikely. The Swans might have sold a player for double what he should be worth, but they also made themselves strong relegation favorites. Maybe Sigurdsson isn't worth \u00a345 million on the open market, but there's a good chance he was actually worth much more than that to the Swans.\n\nThis appears to be a rare lose-lose transfer, with both teams making bad deals.", "id": "9547522", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Gylfi Sigurdsson's \u00a345m transfer is a lose-lose for Everton and Swansea", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xD0qlRAJOyjDQTYZMNOttBjQPUA=/0x367:3054x2085/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56223581/675109792.0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "83404", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea", "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "id": "304436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "id": "304606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Promotion and relegation"}, "id": "306288", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}, "id": "307308", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}, "id": "308111", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "id": "313860", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea City A.F.C."}, "id": "317224", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Bill Kenwright"}, "id": "354368", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Kenwright"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson"}, "id": "372639", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylfi_Sigur\u00f0sson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Farhad Moshiri (businessman)"}, "id": "819321", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farhad_Moshiri_(businessman)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 538, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 822, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "18:45:00"}

League rivals Swansea later on Wednesday if he passes a medical, British media reported.\n\nThe 27-year-old, due to sign a five-year contract worth 100,000 pounds a week, would be Everton's record signing, topping the 31.8 million pounds they paid Chelsea for Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando Llorente, had wanted 50 million pounds.\n\nThey have already turned down two bids from Everton and rejected a reported 40 million pounds offer one from 2016 champions Leicester at the beginning of the summer.\n\nIt is believed, though, that Everton w ill get their way in paying an initial 40 million pounds with another \u00a35m to follow, taking their close season spending under Ronald Koeman to over 140 million pounds.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to 100 million pounds so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the 75 million pound sale of striker Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out till October.\n\nIcelandic international Sigurdsson finished third in combined goals and assists

It breaks the \u00a328m record fee received by Swansea for a player when Bony was sold to Manchester City in 2015, as well as becoming the biggest transfer fee paid in Everton's history.\n\nEverton boss Ronald Koeman believes that has bought his side \"one of the best players in the Premier League\", while Sigurdsson claimed working under the former Barcelona and Netherlands ace was a huge factor in wanting to quit Swansea.\n\nSigurdsson, Swansea's player of the year for the past two seasons, said: \"He was a great player, one of the top players of his time. Now he is a really good manager and his vision for Everton is clear. He has built up a really good squad here, with strong players, both young and experienced. This was a key factor for me.\n\n\"This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction. The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\"\n\nKoeman added: \"It took some time but finally we have signed the player (who) in my opinion, in his position he is one of the best in the Premier League. We have the player here and that's really good for the team.\n\n\"From the beginning, he was one of the key players we wanted to bring to Everton. That's because of his quality, first and foremost, and his experience in the Premier League.\n\n\"We need more productivity. We don't sign one player who will score 25 goals but we need several players around our striker to get that number. He is one of those productive players which he has shown at Swansea and also in the past.\n\n\"He can play in different positions. He can play in midfield, he can play as a number 10 and he can also play in a free role on the side - they are the two or three positions where we will use him.\"", "id": "9561974", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Gylfi Sigurdsson finally completes record \u00a345m move to Everton", "image": "http://i2.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article13487691.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SigurdssonEverton.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1095, "date": "2017-08-31", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1104}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "166", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "83404", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea", "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}, "id": "305682", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "West Bromwich Albion F.C."}, "id": "307096", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}, "id": "307308", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}, "id": "308111", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}, "id": "309322", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"}, {"label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}, "id": "311373", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "id": "313860", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea City A.F.C."}, "id": "317224", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea RFC"}, "id": "346607", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_RFC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Allen (footballer, born 1990)"}, "id": "362472", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Allen_(footballer,_born_1990)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nacer Chadli"}, "id": "362624", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacer_Chadli"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson"}, "id": "372639", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylfi_Sigur\u00f0sson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Clement"}, "id": "424617", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wilfried Bony"}, "id": "468044", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfried_Bony"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 567, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1063, "label": "dmoz/Games/Yard, Deck, and Table Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Yard,_Deck,_and_Table_Games"}], "time": "20:45:00"}

It's very different in terms of culture and climate, even from Paris, than he would have ever experienced in his life. He's still only 24.\n\n\"He needs to be fit and he needs to be focused but if he can get back to the form he showed at Real Madrid - creative, cheeky, explosive, technically very gifted - then people will be flocking to watch Stoke. He's that good.\n\n\"They have brought in quality so it will all depend if the timing is right. I really hope it's a success.\"\n\nRead more: Arsenal game can transform perception of Stoke City, says Robbie Earle\n\nA move to Stoke at this stage of Jese's career would have seemed outlandish when he made his first steps in the senior game, breaking records for Real Madrid's B side.\n\nIt wasn't easy getting a chance in an attacking department featuring Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel di Maria, Mesut Ozil, Kaka, Gonzalo Higuain and Karim Benzema but he always backed himself, it turned out with good reason.\n\nHunter said: \"When Jese burst onto the scene at Real Madrid he was absolutely exceptional. He's one of those footballers with cheek and creativity and before that brutal injury he was also very explosive.\n\n\"There was a time when he was scoring for Real Madrid Castilla - he got 22 in 38 - when he gave a long interview which included criticism of Jose Mourinho. He didn't feel he was getting the chance he should in view of his goals or the fact he had come through the system.\n\n\"Yet when he was promoted by Carlo Ancelotti it became clear he wasn't simply a goal scorer, he would link play and had the ingenuity to go past a man. He was always looking for ways to score.\n\n\"He was the type of footballer that would change the tempo of a match and get supporters on the edge of their seats. He had great pace and the drive and it was telling that Vicente del Bosque was talking about including him in the World Cup squad.\n\n\"This was the Spain team that were reigning world and European champions and to be in consideration, having played relatively so few games for Real Madrid, was no small thing.\"\n\nRead more: Referee for Stoke City v Arsenal announced\n\nA freak incident in a 9-1 aggregate Champions League win over Schalke in February 2014, however, would put a big dent in his progression.\n\nHe would spend nine months out and even though he came back into the squad under Zinedine Zidane , things would never be the same again. Perhaps a second career in hip hop - or reggaeton to be exact, under the stage name Jey M - didn't help either.\n\nHunter explained: \"It was an innocuous challenge that would keep him out for so long. Maybe there was a little bit of a rush to come back and he had an infection which set him back. On top of that there was a fire at his house which can't have helped the mental stain. He ended up being out for more than he needed to be.\n\n\"It was that explosive pace, the ability to get across the length of the pitch like Gareth Bale and destabilise an opponent that maybe were undermined by the injury. Real Madrid didn't look particularly like his second career in reggaeton either and there were suggestions he didn't have that same drive that he had shown when he was coming through.\"\n\nJey M released a single - Yo Sabia , with the chorus, 'Let's make love like it's the last time' - last summer and Jese moved on, joining Paris St Germain on a five-year contract for \u00a322m.\n\n\"Unfortunately at Paris St Germain he bumped into a coach with whom he didn't see eye to eye,\" said Hunter. \"Unai Emery is very, very strict about team patterns while Jese is a guy who craves the freedom to cause positive anarchy.\n\n\"Going home to Las Palmas should have been the perfect move but he walked into a club that had real disunity, the coach was falling out with the board and it didn't work out.\"\n\nThere is hope in Spain that it will be different this time.\n\nHunter said: \"Jese might be too young to have seen Mark Hughes play for Barcelona but he will have asked around and there aren't just fond memories, there is a lot of respect.\"", "id": "9652810", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Explosive Jese can get fans flocking to Stoke, says

And while the additions of Kurt Zouma on loan and Bruno Martins Indi on a permanent deal are nice ones, they're not the most glamorous.\n\nBut it appears that Stoke have been very aware of the talk surrounding them as the Premier League heads into its second week, and addressed it directly while announcing a very exciting new signing - Jese Rodriguez.\n\n\u00f0\u009f'\u0080 We all need a bit of inspiration halfway through the working week...\n\nWe think this tweet will excite you all!#WelcomeJes\u00c3\u00a9 \u00f0\u009f'\u008b #SCFC \u00f0\u009f\"\u00b4\u00e2\u009a\u00aa\u00ef\u00b8\u008f pic.twitter.com/FZQ7Zw3tw2 -- Stoke City FC (@stokecity)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nWell that showed all those pundits, didn't it?

But despite all that Jese can be deployed in a number of attacking positions and is likely to add some much-needed flair to Stoke's line-up.\n\nIt's definitely got fans pumped - especially when you consider this slightly bizarre fact.\n\n1 - Stoke have more CL winners than any other EPL club but combined Fletcher, Shaq, Afellay, Jese & Bojan have played 1 min in finals. #SCFC -- Robin Bairner (@RBairner)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nLet's see what effect all those Champions League winners can have on Stoke's season.", "id": "9489953", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Stoke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new signing was announced in the most aggressive way possible", "image": "/remote/content.assets.pressassociation.io/2017/08/16130635/PA-32417809-Cropped.jpg?rect=0,0,4434,2494&ext=.jpg&width=600&s=bn-802298", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 878, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-16", "amb": false, "textEnd": 893}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "id": "303026", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Talk radio"}, "id": "306009", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_radio"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}, "id": "306200", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "West Bromwich Albion F.C."}, "id": "307096", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}, "id": "322883", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}, "id": "323204", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}, "id": "345339", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal"}, {"label": {"eng": "Marko Arnautovi\u0107"}, "id": "373518", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marko_Arnautovi\u0107"}, {"label": {"eng": "Darren Fletcher"}, "id": "418689", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Fletcher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kurt Zouma"}, "id": "549455", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Zouma"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ibrahim Afellay"}, "id": "582546", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Afellay"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bruno Martins Indi"}, "id": "610103", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Martins_Indi"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 373, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 913, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans"}], "time": "13:44:00"}

According to the BBC, the Toffees have agreed to a \u00a345 million fee for Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson. So now what?\n\nEverton have had an interesting summer. They've spent like crazy, having brought in seven new first-team players, including Sigurdsson. A team that spends that much, particularly one that goes out and spends \u00a345 million on one guy, is usually looking to make a leap into the next tier of its league. Everton are a bit of a unique case, though, given that all this money has been spent to fill holes left by the departure of Romelu Lukaku, perhaps the best striker in England, and the soon-to-be-departed Ross Barkley, a probably overrated player who nevertheless has been a key fixture in the lineup.\n\nFor most of the summer, it wasn't hard to see what manager Ronald Koeman was after: an improved defense (Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford), and enough scorers to patch together the 25 goals Lukaku took with him (Davy Klaassen, Wayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez). All that was missing, then, was the kind of creative midfield player that Barkley (theoretically) is, one capable of supplying all those new scorers with chances.\n\nOn the surface, Sigurdsson seems to scratch that itch. He finished last season with nine goals and 13 assists in 38 appearances. Eight of those assists came from set-pieces, though, and 38 of the chances he created last season came from corner kicks. When you zero in on just the chances Sigurdsson created from open play last season, he suddenly looks a lot less like the creative playmaker Everton are in need of:\n\nSo, Sigurdsson profiles as an attacking midfielder who can get himself a goal when needed and excels at picking out target men with crosses from set-pieces. There's nothing wrong with a player like that, but Everton already have two second striker-types in Klaassen and Rooney, and not much in the way of a target man.\n\nAt Swansea, Sigurdsson had the 6-foot-5 Fernando Llorente to fire his crosses at, but as Everton are currently constituted he'll be trying to pick out Wayne Rooney, Sandro Ramirez, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the box, all of whom are 5-foot-9.\n\nThe transfer window isn't closed, of course, and it's entirely possible that Everton still have a big striker on their transfer wish list. There have been rumors about a move for Olivier Giroud, Christian Benteke, or even Danny Welbeck, but so far none of those seem all that close to happening. Unless a player like that is brought in before the window closes, it's hard to see how Sigurdsson fits into the side or provides anything Everton don't already have.\n\nThat's a strange thing to say about a player that costs \u00a345 million, but such is life in the post-TV money era of EPL inflation. For a price that used to fetch a season-altering star player, Everton have acquired a guy who, unless another move is made soon, may very well end up spending the season doing little more than whipping useless crosses into the box.", "id": "9361196", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "What Will Everton Actually Get From Gylfi Sigurdsson?", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--LNNqwqy9--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/uogiq46egpxoyq9vx8tn.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BBC"}, "id": "302926", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}, "id": "304438", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}, "id": "307308", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}, "id": "308111", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romelu Lukaku"}, "id": "311381", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ross Barkley"}, "id": "313867", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Barkley"}, {"label": {"eng": "Christian Benteke"}, "id": "316625", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Benteke"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fernando Llorente"}, "id": "316630", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Llorente"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olivier Giroud"}, "id": "319720", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Giroud"}, {"label": {"eng": "Danny Welbeck"}, "id": "329506", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Welbeck"}, {"label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}, "id": "331554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson"}, "id": "372639", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylfi_Sigur\u00f0sson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roger Lukaku"}, "id": "393602", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Lukaku"}, {"label": {"eng": "Davy Klaassen"}, "id": "808808", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Klaassen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}, "id": "1272098", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 448, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 523, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 567, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "21:35:00"}

The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\n\n\"For myself, I would like to score as many goals as possible and create as many goals for my teammates as I can. These are my targets.\n\n\"But it is always the same thing: as long as the team is winning I will be more than happy.\"\n\nSigurdsson also acknowledged that the prospect of working under Ronald Koeman - twice a European Cup winner as a player - further fuelled his desire to play for Everton.\n\n\"He was a great player, one of the top players of his time,\" said Sigurdsson.\n\n\"Now he is a really good manager and his vision for Everton is clear. He has built up a really good squad here, with strong players, both young and experienced.\n\n\"This was a key factor for me. Ultimately, that is a dream of mine and everyone at this club. I know the supporters and players would agree with that.\"\n\nKoeman was delighted to land a player he revealed had been in his sights for some time.\n\n\"I'm really happy because the board and especially our chairman, Bill Kenwright, did everything to get him. It took some time but finally we have signed the player,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"In my opinion, in his position he is one of the best in the Premier League. We have the player here and that's really good for the team.\n\n\"From the beginning, he was one of the key players we wanted to bring to Everton. That's because of his quality, first and foremost, and his experience in the Premier League.\n\n\"We need more productivity. We don't sign one player who will score 25 goals but we need several players around our striker to get that number.

He also covered the greatest distance covered by any top-flight player during the season - 433 kilometres - and has been directly involved in 53 league goals since the start of 2014/15 - second only as a midfielder to Tottenham's Christian Eriksen.\n\nEverton boss Koeman was thrilled to capture one of his prime targets, who he believes will add \"productivity\" to his ambitious team.\n\nAnd Sigurdsson is eager to deliver what his new manager is looking for.\n\n\"Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the Club,\" Sigurdsson told evertontv.\n\n\"This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction. The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\n\n\"For myself, I would like to score as many goals as possible and create as many goals for my teammates as I can. These are my targets.\n\n\"But it is always the same thing: as long as the team is winning I will be more than happy.\"\n\nSigurdsson also acknowledged that the prospect of working under Koeman - twice a European Cup winner as a player - further fuelled his desire to play for Everton.\n\n\"He was a great player, one of the top players of his time,\" said Sigurdsson. \"Now he is a really good manager and his vision for Everton is clear. He has built up a really good squad here, with strong players, both young and experienced.\n\n\"This was a key factor for me. Ultimately, that is a dream of mine and everyone at this Club. I know the supporters and players would agree with that.\"\n\nKoeman was delighted to land a player he revealed had been in his sights for some time.\n\n\"I'm really happy because the Board and especially our Chairman, Bill Kenwright, did everything to get him. It took some time but finally we have signed the player,\" Koeman told evertontv.\n\n\"In my opinion, in his position he is one of the best in the Premier League. We have the player here and that's really good for the team.\"\n\nBorn in Reykjav\u00edk, Sigurdsson began his youth career in his homeland with Fimleikaf\u00e9lag Hafnarfjar\u00f0ar (FH) and Brei\u00f0ablik UBK, before moving to English shores to join Reading as a 16-year-old.\n\nHe signed for 1899 Hoffenheim in 2010, with fans voting for him as their Player of the Season, before he joined Swansea on loan on New Year's Day 2012.\n\nBut a permanent transfer to the Swans collapsed and Tottenham Hotspur swooped. He spent two seasons at White Hart Lane, scoring eight goals in 58 top-flight appearances, but then re-joined the Swans for a second spell. He was named the Swans' Player of the Year in both 2015/16 and 2016/17, his displays establishing him as a firm fans' favourite at the Liberty Stadium.\n\nOn the international stage, the midfielder starred for Iceland as they reached the quarter finals of Euro 2016.

Those kind of players cost upwards of \u00a320million but it's now looking clearer and clearer than Newcastle won't be spending that kind of money anytime soon.\n\nInstead Rafa Benitez is looking for bargains and that is why he's ended up spending \u00a35million on a striker who couldn't get a game for Stoke.\n\nThat does not mean it's not potentially a good signing. His record in Germany wasn't too bad and he's got ability, which is why Rafa Benitez is going for him. He knows him from his Real Madrid days and Benitez has an eye for a talent, so that's a positive.\n\nWhat I mean about not getting too excited is that we have to be realistic. You don't get much for \u00a35million and if he turns out to be a Premier League goalscorer who can get double figures this season, it will be one of Newcastle's best deals in recent years. That sort of money doesn't even buy you a striker from the Championship these days.\n\nI've not seen much of Joselu but I hear he's got the raw ability to be a good player, it just hasn't worked out at Stoke for whatever reason. And that does happen sometimes - a player goes somewhere else, gets a fresh lease of life and starts scoring goals or playing well.\n\nHe's certainly not going to need any motivation. For me he's moving from a club who might be more established in the Premier League but Newcastle is potentially a bigger stage for him. There's not many better moves for a player of his calibre and if he puts everything in, scores a few goals and performs at the best of his ability the fans will take to him in no time.\n\nFor Rafa, it's another body and someone to work with. He'll know his strengths and weaknesses and he'll think 'I can do something with this guy'. It gives him competition so I can't see too many negatives at the price he's paying.\n\nOf course it's frustrating that Newcastle aren't bringing in the sort of players that we really hoped for but you do the best you can with the money you have. They probably need two or three more at least but this is a start.\n\nRead More Newcastle United Transfer News", "id": "9288823", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "NUFC are striking a 'no-lose' deal for Joselu, reckons Mick Quinn", "image": "http://i3.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13479790.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Burton-Albion-v-Stoke-City-Pre-Season-friendly.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "85691", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Football League Championship"}, "id": "306186", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}, "id": "306279", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "Double (association football)"}, "id": "307307", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}, "id": "317441", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "A-League"}, "id": "320939", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}, "id": "322883", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Joselu"}, "id": "373517", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "13:43:00"}

Romelu Lukaku in 2014.\n\nSigurdsson, who played a pivotal role in Swansea retaining their Premier League status last term after scoring nine goals and creating 13, pulled out of their pre-season tour to the United States and was not included in the squad for last weekend's 0-0 draw with Southampton.\n\nSwansea, who are also battling to keep Chelsea target and veteran Spanish striker Fernando

is believed, though, that Everton will get their way in paying an initial \u00a340m with another \u00a35m to follow, taking their close season spending under Ronald Koeman to over \u00a3140m.\n\nEverton's majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri has spent close to \u00a3100m so far in recruiting former favourite Wayne Rooney, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford (\u00a330m), midfielder Davy Klaassen (\u00a323.6m), defender Michael Keane (\u00a330m), Cuco Martina and Sandro Ramirez.\n\nHowever, a considerable proportion of the spending has been financed by the \u00a375m sale of striker Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United.\n\nThey could further balance the books with a big money sale of midfielder Ross Barkley to Tottenham Hotspur, although he is presently injured and likely to be out

"isDuplicate": false, "storyUri": "eng-3360188", "body": "All change as Stoke prepare to lose one Spaniard for another providing Rodriquez arrives on loan from PSG\n\nRAFA BENITEZ'S swoop for Stoke City striker Joselu looks a winner once the Potters land Jese Rodriguez from Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nStoke are hopeful they can seal a season-long loan for Rodriguez from PSG, but remain wary of any last-minute hiccups.\n\nAnd once the 24 year-old former Real Madrid striker is on his way, they will then allow Spanish hitman Joselu to join Newcastle for around \u00a35million.\n\nSo it will be a case of one Spanish striker in and another out for the Potters, who lost their opening Premier League game at Everton on Saturday.\n\nJoselu scored four times for Stoke in 2015/2016.\n\nLast season he was loaned to Deportivo La Coruna, where he scored five goals in 20 games.\n\nBenitez, though, will look beyond the 27-year-old's modest goal-scoring record.\n\nThe Stoke Sentinel says the Toon boss knows Joselu well from the Real Madrid youth team and will fancy his physical presence to do well in the Premier League.\n\nJoselu was missing from Stoke's 1-0 loss at Goodison as the club were locked in talks with Newcastle over a permanent deal.\n\nRodriquez, 24, is highly talented and boasts plenty of unfulfilled potential after his career was rocked by a serious knee ligament injury three years ago.\n\nHence he struggled to make his mark at Real and was eventually sold to PSG for around \u00a322m last summer.\n\nSadly, failed to make an impact in Paris and was loaned back to his hometown club Las Palmas for the second half of last season.\n\nKeep up to date with ALL the latest transfer news and speculation with our live transfer feed\n\nThree goals in 13 starts and three sub appearances for Las Palmas followed just the one league goal in one start and eight sub appearances for PSG in the first half of last season.\n\nNewly-promoted Newcastle, meanwhile, also lost their first Premier League game 2-0 at home to Tottenham.", "id": "9063747", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez in swoop for Stoke star Joselu with Jese Rodriguez to

It was also a good factor for me that the manager is from Spain, for the language, but I am at an English club and I try to talk with everybody in English because it is the language for the country, but it was an important point for the decision.\n\n\"I only speak English for two years but I try to learn at home and my wife speaks English and helps me every day.\n\n\"I try to be part of the country as quick as possible.\"\n\nAnd reflecting on his time at Real Madrid, Joselu added: \"The experience was so nice. I made my debut in the first division under Jose Mourinho.\n\n\"I was 18/19 and I don't even know how to explain to you the emotion making my debut in the Bernabeu.\n\n\"The experience helped me as a professional player now. I scored three times for Real Madrid and it was amazing.\n\n\"The experience when you travel with the first team, two times in pre-season in LA and the fans screaming, it was amazing.\n\n\"But it's Real Madrid, one of the best teams in the world and after that I tried to be a better professional.\"\n\nHis move to the Premier League also means he now played in three of the top divisions in Europe.\n\nHaving played for Real Madrid in La Liga a couple of times he also went on to appear in the Bundesliga for Hoffenheim, Eintracht Frankfurt and Hannover 96.\n\nHe added: \"I played my first year in Spain, I played three years in Germany and then came to the Premier League.\n\n\"The three leagues are very different but it was a good experience and definitely think the Premier League is the best league.

His numbers prove that,\" Wright said.\n\n\"It's disastrous for Swansea. This deal has been rumbling on for months and Paul Clement must have been fretting about this day for a long time simply because he knows it's going to happen at some stage, and now it has happened he knows it's left a massive void in the Swansea squad.\n\n\"However, Everton are getting one of the top players. It's a fantastic signing for the club, but obviously disastrous for Swansea.\"\n\nThe Debate Podcast\n\nCatch up with every episode of The Debate with our podcast\n\nEverton have been active in the transfer market this summer, bringing Wayne Rooney, Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen and Sandro Ramirez to Goodison Park.\n\nSigurdsson's impending arrival takes Ronald Koeman's summer spending spree to around \u00a3150m and Andy Townsend praised the ambition the Toffees have shown as they look to close the gap on the Premier League top four.\n\nBut the former Chelsea, Aston Villa and Middlesbrough midfielder does not believe they are ready to break into the Champions League places this season.\n\nThe Debate\n\nAugust 16, 2017, 10:00pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\n\"Everton have brought in some good players and I admire the way that they've gone about it,\" Townsend said.\n\nThere's a lot of teams in that bracket that have conceded on muscling in with the top six in the Premier League. Everton have refused to accept that and I admire that. Yes they've got new owners and yes there's more money to spend, but they've refused to accept it. They want to get involved in the battle at the top.\n\n\"Michael Keane and Jordan Pickford are good young players. It's a bit of a toss of a coin with someone like Davy Klassen but they've obviously picked up Wayne Rooney with all of his experience and his quality. And now Gylfi Sigurdsson as well as one or two others and they've got five players who strengthen the team.\n\n\"And I don't think they are done yet [in the transfer window]. It appears they are still looking to add to their pot. It's not easy bringing in eight or nine players and chucking them all into the team, expecting it to all come together automatically. However, it's great for the league and great if you are an Evertonian.\n\nWhen asked if Everton could gatecrash the Premier League's top four, Townsend replied: \"I don't think they can challenge for the top four. I think the Europa League places are where they will finish.\"\n\nWatch The Debate every weeknight at 10pm on Sky Sports Premier League.

He covered a host of topics during an insightful 10-minute conversation and the beaming smile never left his face.\n\nSigurdsson talked of scoring and creating goals, of giving his peak footballing years to Everton.\n\nThe 27-year-old was speaking to evertontv about the pride and excitement he felt on completing his move to Goodison Park.\n\nIt has become a wonderfully familiar accompaniment to an invigorating summer: the sight and sound of men genuinely thrilled to be able to call themselves Everton footballers.\n\nAnd these aren't just any old footballers, either. Among their number is the most promising young goalkeeper in the land. A defender who won his first England cap earlier this year and possesses the attributes and aura to be the bedrock of Everton's rearguard for some years to come - his country's as well.\n\nThe young Dutch international from Ajax, a striker admired by Real Madrid and who shone for Spain at the European Under-21 Championship... and England's record international goalscorer.\n\nAs he outlined his reasons for joining Everton, Sigurdsson referenced the \"intent\" shown by the Club in this transfer window. The numbers reflect that ambition - the gifted midfielder from Swansea became the Blues' record signing when he penned his five-year deal. It was the third time Everton have upped that mark inside two months, following the purchases of Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane.\n\nSeeing Sigurdsson so at ease in his new environment and looking every inch the Evertonian in his pristine blue training kit, was to be reminded of another first-rate footballer who signed for the Blues when his career was at its apogee.\n\nJoe Royle set his sights high after winning the FA Cup in 1995 and went all out to bring one of Manchester United's best players to Goodison Park.\n\nIt took a while - but, in late August, Andrei Kanchelskis signed for Everton. As he posed for pictures - these were the days when a player unveiling amounted to him being snapped hoisting the Club scarf above his head - Kanchelskis cut the same contented, peppy figure as Sigurdsson would 22 years later.\n\nHe was gushing about signing for Everton, too, underlining his delight at joining a \"big club\" with big ambitions.\n\nLuring one of Manchester United's prized assets to Goodison was a significant coup for Royle, no doubt. The manager of the day knew all about Everton, though. He had won the league title playing for the Club.\n\nRoyle went at this deal emboldened by his inherent belief that Everton was the pinnacle - and able to dangle the Cup so memorably won at Wembley months previously in front of Kanchelskis as tangible proof of a team on an upwards trajectory.\n\nSimilarly, when Everton fended off the challenge of Arsenal to sign Tony Cottee in a British-record deal in 1988, the Londoner from West Ham knew he was joining a side who, one year earlier, had been English champions.\n\nCottee was 23 when he made his Blues' debut. Kanchelskis joined as a 26-year-old.\n\nIn both instances, Everton was a relatively easy sell to these excellent, aspirational young footballers.\n\nAnd as Sigurdsson effused about the prospect of working with Ronald Koeman, one of the European game's most revered personalities, he unwittingly gave an insight into what an attractive proposition the Club is right now.\n\nHe was similarly enthusiastic about his fellow Goodison new boys and the scale of the ambition Everton have displayed by signing Pickford, Keane, Davy Klaassen, Sandro Ramirez and Wayne Rooney.\n\nTellingly, Sigurdsson, unprompted, also mentioned the young players who form an essential part of Koeman's vision for a powerful and successful Everton.\n\nThat Tom Davies, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ademola Lookman and Mason Holgate were all in the Blues' first Premier League squad this season, points to the fact Koeman is developing something sustainable.\n\nThis is not a manager overseeing a scattergun transfer policy with no thought for what happens beyond this current campaign.\n\nKoeman has adopted Royle's attitude of Everton being a place where any footballer worth his salt should want to play.\n\nFor his plans to come to fruition, the boss has required the unstinting backing of the Blues' like-minded Chairman and board.\n\nYou don't land an individual like Sigurdsson without everybody working from the same page.\n\nMuch less would a player of the Icelander's calibre be so full of beans at the thought of playing for Everton if he didn't sense the Club was making a concerted effort to compete with the elite.\n\nThere are a plethora of statistics to illustrate just why Koeman so eagerly coveted Sigurdsson.\n\nThe numbers - revolving around the player's goalscoring prowess, creativity and running capacity - all add up to something rather special.\n\nYou need only watch him in action, though, to appreciate what a sublime talent Sigurdsson possesses.\n\nHis willingness to put in the hard yards is relevant, too. Examples are legion of a team's star turn refusing to dig in when the going gets tough.\n\nSigurdsson, though, took it upon himself to do something about Swansea's plight last season, when the Welsh side's dicey start to the campaign left them staring a relegation battle square in the face.\n\nHe was vital to Swansea's eventual Premier League survival, providing a potent cocktail of goals - either from his own boot, or by teeing up teammates to score - and readiness to get stuck in, reflected in the fact he ran further than any player in the division last season.\n\nFootball is about entertainment, too. Watching Sigurdsson glide across the pitch, his boots making a passing acquaintance with the turf, is a joy. His quick-witted passing and knack for making the right decisions in possession will go down well at Goodison - with team-mates and supporters alike.\n\nKanchelskis was, by Royle's reckoning, \"truly phenomenal,\" during his first campaign at Goodison - when Everton finished in sixth spot.\n\nEverton spent \u00a35million on the exhilarating Ukranian winger - at a time when the British transfer record was \u00a38.5million, a decidedly sober figure by modern standards.\n\n\"Crazy,\" Sigurdsson laughed as he considered today's transfer fees.\n\nEverton's business this summer, though, is anything but. The Blues recruitment so far has been sagacious, sensible... and enormously exciting.", "id": "9705412", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Exciting Times Boost Everton Appeal", "image": "http://www.evertonfc.com//d2qsy1h1438jt3.cloudfront.net/~/media/0159cdb18029486a802d043e2eee9cc6.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "242110", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "id": "303026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}, "id": "303977", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Wayne Rooney"}, "id": "304438", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}, "id": "306200", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}, "id": "307308", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}, "id": "308111", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}, "id": "311373", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "2014 FA Cup Final"}, "id": "360545", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FA_Cup_Final"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tony Cottee"}, "id": "364039", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Cottee"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson"}, "id": "372639", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylfi_Sigur\u00f0sson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andrei Kanchelskis"}, "id": "498082", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Kanchelskis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Royle"}, "id": "560600", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Royle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Davy Klaassen"}, "id": "808808", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Klaassen"}, {"label": {"eng": "1998\u201399 Manchester United F.C. season"}, "id": "1134292", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998\u201399_Manchester_United_F.C._season"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}, "id": "1272098", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 447, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 822, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "14:07:00"}

Adam Bate delves deeper into the data to find out.\n\nThere is no doubt that Sigurdsson played a key role in Swansea's survival. With nine goals and 13 assists, he was directly involved in more of the Swans' strikes than any other player, scoring winners against Liverpool and Southampton and a late equaliser at Old Trafford. He was duly named player of the season by both supporters and team-mates.\n\nSo perhaps it should be no surprise that Everton were desperate to bring Sigurdsson to Goodison Park. They will have been further encouraged by the fact that the 28-year-old attacking midfielder covered more ground than any other Premier League player last season. He ranked third in the country for assists and was seventh for total chances created.\n\nBut curiously, there are doubts about the robustness and repeatability of what Sigurdsson achieved at Swansea. In particular, a deeper look at those assists raises issues. According to Opta, although Sigurdsson registered 13 of them, the number of goals that Swansea might have expected to score from the opportunities he fashioned last season was only 6.85.\n\nWhat are expected assists?\n\nOpta says: \"The Expected Assist Model measure the likelihood that a pass will be a goal assist based on where the pass was received, what type of pass it was and a variety of other factors.\"\n\nThe reason for this is that the quality of chance being created by Sigurdsson was not particularly high. This is largely because an extraordinarily high number of them came from set-pieces rather than open play. Fifty-two of the chances Sigurdsson created were from dead-ball situations - nobody else in the Premier League could come up with more than 40.\n\nIn fact, Sigurdsson was credited with 38 chances created from corner kicks alone. There are a number of reasons why this could be problematic. While Sigurdsson's delivery is undoubtedly impressive, these are generally considered difficult opportunities to convert - often headers that are being won under pressure amidst a crowd of bodies.\n\nThat the number is so high surely owes much to the abilities of his targets in the penalty box. Eleven of those chances created from corners found their way to 6'4\" striker Fernando Llorente, renowned for his heading ability. A further 13 were to Alfie Mawson, a young defender who scored seven goals in a season at both Barnsley and Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nNext on the list? That's Mawson's fellow defender Federico Fernandez. Indeed, defenders were the recipients of the majority of these chances - a reflection of the fact that more than two thirds of all chances created by Sigurdsson were headers. Fernandez got on the end of five corners without finding the net. In fact, only one of them was even on target.\n\nJust because Llorente, Mawson and Fernandez are capable of diverting an outswinging corner in the general direction of the goal - and 28 of these 38 chances were from right-wing corners - does not necessarily mean the numbers are transferable to another club. Tellingly, only three of these corners actually resulted directly in Swansea goals.\n\nOf course, expertise from set plays is not a negative. The fact that Swansea ranked in the top three in the Premier League for both headed and set-piece goals was a huge factor in their survival. Everton surely plan to put Sigurdsson on corners and free-kicks in the expectation that he can help to boost their own numbers in this regard.\n\nMoreover, the fact that this skill is such a big part of Sigurdsson's game adds context to the question marks over his age relative to his price. While he could be on the cusp of a downturn in output at 28, his set-piece delivery is unlikely to suffer into this 30s. That will bring confidence that he will be a useful asset for the full length of his next contract.\n\nMan City vs Everton\n\nAugust 21, 2017, 7:00pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\nHowever, it is vital that Everton appreciate what they would be getting for their huge investment. While the headline numbers put Sigurdsson in the top bracket of Premier League creators alongside Kevin De Bruyne, Christian Eriksen, Mesut Ozil and David Silva, the type and quality of the chances they supply for team-mates are actually very different.\n\nTo illustrate the point further, there are 71 players who created more open-play chances than Sigurdsson in the Premier League last season. That included Kevin Mirallas and three other Everton players. Ross Barkley created 54 such chances. Sigurdsson managed only 25 - the same number that Gareth Barry and Idrissa Gueye produced in fewer games.\n\nEven from set plays, it is uncertain how much of an impact that Sigurdsson might have at Everton given that Barkley, Mirallas and Baines shared the team's set-piece duties last term, creating 51 opportunities in the process - only one fewer than Sigurdsson. A quality player then, but one whose signature comes with considerable caveats.\n\nAlso See: Transfer Centre Latest transfer news", "id": "9500921", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title":

if he plays against Arsenal on Saturday.\n\nRodriguez, now at PSG, suffered a ruptured cruciate knee ligament injury while playing for Real Madrid three years ago and, as fate would have it, the player involved in the costly challenge that evening happens to be Arsenal new signing Sead Kolasinac.\n\nBut Stoke boss Mark Hughes has satisfied himself that 24 year-old Rodriguez has overcome the physical and emotional trauma caused by the injury when playing for Real in the Champions League against Schalke in March 2014.\n\nRodriguez's signing will include a substantial loan fee which, together with the fee involved in signing Kurt Zouma on loan from Chelsea, is likely to add up to more than \u00a310m.\n\nRodriguez's arrival at Stoke on a season-long loan is tied up with the simultaneous sale of Joselu to Newcastle on two fronts.\n\nRead More: Stoke City must produce greater goal threat against Arsenal - Lou Macari\n\nStoke understandably wanted to ensure a replacement before allowing Joselu to join a Premier League rival for around the \u00a35.75m it cost to buy him from Hanover two years ago.\n\nAnd by coincidence, both Rodriguez and Joselu have the same agent and so that gave Stoke some useful leverage on negotiations.Joselu scored four times in 10 starts and a dozen sub appearances in his one and only campaign at Stoke before being farmed out on loan to Deportivo last season.\n\nHe returned belatedly to the club in pre-season and promptly scored four goals in two friendlies, but the decision to part company had already been made by manager and player.\n\nAn initial bid from Newcastle was knocked back and considered as derisory by Stoke, but Rafa Benitez was always expected to return with a more acceptable offer for his Spanish compatriot.\n\nJoselu... a rare moment of joy after a goal at Watford 17 months ago\n\nRodriguez's injury in 2014, on the player's own admission, severely hampered his attempts to live up to his huge early potential in Madrid.\n\nA Real player since the age of 14, Rodriguez was soon earning rave notices as he broke records for their reserve side before breaking through into the first team.By 21 he had a Champions League winners' medal to his name and was even being compared to team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nHis knee injury seemingly affected him physically and mentally after so long out, however, and he evidently didn't return the same player as he scored four in 23 appearances in his comeback season (2014/15).\n\nThe following campaign saw him net half-a-dozen times in 38 first-team appearances, but he failed to score in his last nine before being sold in the summer of 2016 to PSG for around \u00a322m.\n\nIn France last season he scored one league goal in one start and eight appearances from the bench for PSG.\n\nRead More: Bojan poses familiar problem for Stoke City\n\nThat prompted a decision to allow him to join hometown club Las Palmas on loan for the second half of last season, after which he scored three in 13 La Liga starts and three further games from the bench.\n\nRodriguez has appeared for Spanish youth teams from under-16s through to under-21s and, according to then national team boss Vicente del Bosque, was earmarked for a call-up for the 2014 World Cup finals before his knee injury struck in the March.\n\nMeanwhile, the club's hierarchy have let it be known that Stoke will not sell Joe Allen in this transfer window.\n\nSwansea made an initial inquiry and newspaper reports have since claimed they are ready with a substantial bid, but the club believes their Welsh cousins have accepted the not-for-sale message.", "id": "9248237", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Stoke City newcomer heading to date with destiny against

And that's my opinion that it should do.\"\n\nAlso See: Barry having West Brom medical Talks set for transfer changes", "id": "9347201", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Everton agree \u00a345m deal for Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson", "image": "http://e2.365dm.com/17/08/150x150/skysports-football-swansea-city-gylfi-sigurdsson-pre-season_4070360.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iceland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "108", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iceland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "82759", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "83404", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea", "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "86084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside", "label": {"eng": "Merseyside"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}, "id": "304436", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}, "id": "307308", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}, "id": "307958", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}, "id": "308111", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}, "id": "311377", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea City A.F.C."}, "id": "317224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea RFC"}, "id": "346607", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_RFC"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson"}, "id": "372639", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylfi_Sigur\u00f0sson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paul Clement"}, "id": "424617", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News HQ"}, "id": "1274862", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News_HQ"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 14, "label": "dmoz/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Sports"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 529, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 530, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Resources/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 645, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing"}], "time": "19:44:00"}

signings to follow Joselu\n\nThe 27-year-old is set to become Newcastle's sixth capture since the end of last season after passing a medical and agreeing terms on a \u00a350,000-a-week move to the North-East.\n\nBut busy boss Benitez wants to take his number of new recruits into double figures before the transfer deadline and the end of this month.\n\nFormer Spain Under-21 international Joselu is keen to kick-start his Premier League career after being farmed out by Stoke on loan last season to Deportivo la Coruna.\n\nThat came after a disappointing first season in the Potteries when he scored four goals in 22 league appearances following a \u00a35.75m move from Hannover in 2015.\n\nDespite Toon owner Mike Ashley warning that he won't spend big to boost the club's bid to re-establish itself in the top flight after winning promotion, Benitez is also confident of pushing through a loan deal for Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Kenedy.\n\nNewcastle legend Micky Quinn predicts the final 2017/18 Premier League table MICKY QUINN has predicted the final 2017/18 Premier League table ahead of the new campaign. 1 / 21 GETTY Micky Quinn's predicted Premier League table\n\nThe Spaniard is also keen on \u00a33m-rated Legia Warsaw central defender Michal Pazdan, Arsenal striker Lucas Perez and Udinese's 32-year-old Greece international keeper Orestis Karnezis, who is available for \u00a33.5m.\n\nOut in the cold quartet Manu Riviere, Massadio Haidara, Tim Krul and Jack Colback are all expected to leave in the next few days to make way for further new arrivals over the next fortnight.\n\nBenitez has been boosted by news that crocked Toon duo Florian Lejeune and Paul Dummett are set to return after next month's international break.\n\nThe pair limped out of the 2-0 opening game defeat to Tottenham - Dummett pulling a hamstring and French debutant Lejeune damaging ankle ligaments after being on the receiving end of a nasty scissor challenge from England striker Harry Kane.\n\nIt was feared the defenders could be out for a lengthy spell to add to Benitez's worries as he tries to get the best out his wafer-thin squad.\n\nBut after initial assessments, the club's medical staff are hopeful the two players will be back in contention for the trip to Swansea on September 10.\n\nThat means they will miss Sunday's trip to fellow Premier League new boys Huddersfield and West Ham's visit to St James' Park a week later.\n\nSkipper Jamaal Lascelles and Chancel Mbemba are set to deputise in the back four against David Wagner's side at the John Smith's Stadium.\n\nA Newcastle club statement said: \"Assessments by the club's medical staff are continuing in order to establish the full extent of their injuries,\n\n\"Both players are expected to be out

We brought in Wayne Rooney, Sandro Ram\u00edrez and now Gylfi, and maybe they can share the goals around more than happened last season, but we still need another one to play the No9. When you play in Europe, and let's hope we reach Europe, and in the Premier League you cannot do it with just one or two strikers.\"\n\nEverton, whose summer spending now stands at \u00a3131m, were linked with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud last month, though the French striker appears to have made his peace with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and Koeman no longer believes there is any possibility of a deal. He admits time is running out and that it is difficult to sign top quality players when you cannot offer Champions League football - unless they can deal with the threat of Hajduk Split in the play-off round that begins on Thursday Everton will not even be in a position to offer Europa League football - but remains hopeful at least one of his targets will be landed before the end of the month. Koeman would also like left-sided cover for Leighton Baines in defence, though a striker is a clear priority.\n\n\"We have signed Sandro and Wayne, and we know the development of Dominic [Calvert-Lewin], but we are looking for an extra striker and it is difficult because it needs to be a player of a certain quality or a young player who can improve,\" Koeman said. \"We know we have the possibility to sign good players but we don't play Champions League and that sometimes makes decisions very difficult.\"\n\nIt was never a difficult decision for the Everton manager to go after Sigurdsson, a player he tried to sign when in charge of Southampton, though Koeman did admit to finding it surprisingly hard to let go of Gareth Barry, who has joined West Bromwich Albion in search of more regular football and the five games he needs to pass Ryan Giggs's all-time record of Premier League appearances.\n\n\"We tried when I was at Southampton to sign Sigurdsson but we did not have the finance that we have here at Everton,\" he said. \"In my opinion, in his position, he is one of the best players in the Premier League. We want more productivity in the team after losing Lukaku and that is exactly what Gylfi brings. We have worked a long time to get this deal done but he is one of the key players we wanted to bring in. Last season apart from Lukaku we did not have one player who scored 10 goals. Now, with Gylfi, Wayne and Sandro, we think that might be different.\"\n\nKoeman revealed he had been open to keeping the experienced Barry in the squad but the player realised he faced much stiffer competition for first-team places.\n\n\"You never want to lose a top professional like Gareth but I could understand his position,\" he said. \"He knew he would not be appearing every week and he is still the type of player who wants to keep playing. I let him go because I respect him, but I still had to ask myself whether we had enough midfield cover.

the yardstick by which No.10s should primarily be judged.\n\nThey are Cesc Fabregas (37), Mesut Ozil (33), Christian Eriksen (30) and Kevin De Bruyne (27).\n\nNot bad company to keep.\n\nSigurdsson's set-pieces have been held up as an important factor behind the Blues' determination to sign him, and he claimed 13 assists in total last term, with eight coming from dead-ball deliveries.\n\nGoals\n\nThe Everton target scored nine goals last season for relegation threatened Swansea, including three from the penalty spot.\n\nFive of those goals came against teams in the top six, meaning only Jamie Vardy scored more against top sides.\n\nSwansea scored 45 goals last season, with Sigurdsson directly involved in nearly half.\n\nThe attacking midfielder either scored or assisted a whopping 48.9% of the Swans' goals.\n\nOnly Jermain Defoe (58.6%) and Romelu Lukaku (50%) were involved in more for Sunderland and Everton respectively.\n\nThe former Tottenham man is also the Swans' all-time Premier League goalscorer and assist holder.\n\nHe's netted 34 goals in the top flight for the Welsh side as well as claiming 29 assists.\n\nFree-kicks\n\nSince making his Premier League debut in 2011, no player has scored more free-kicks than the Icelander.\n\nSigurdsson has curled home seven times from dead-ball situations to edge clear of Juan Mata and Robert Snodgrass' tally of six.\n\nRunning stats\n\nIn a football world that places an increased emphasis on running stats, Sigurdsson covered 433km last term - more than any other player in the division.", "id": "9556188", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "The stats that justify Blues' \u00a340m capture of Sigurdsson", "image": "http://i4.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article13487747.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS128061485.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iceland"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "108", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iceland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "83404", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea", "label": {"eng": "Swansea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}, "id": "306207", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Promotion and relegation"}, "id": "306288", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jermain Defoe"}, "id": "307097", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermain_Defoe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}, "id": "307098", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}, "id": "307308", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Penalty kick"}, "id": "307311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick"}, {"label": {"eng": "Direct free kick"}, "id": "307576", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_free_kick"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}, "id": "308111", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Romelu Lukaku"}, "id": "311381", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jamie Vardy"}, "id": "313856", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Vardy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}, "id": "313860", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cesc F\u00e0bregas"}, "id": "313866", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesc_F\u00e0bregas"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mesut \u00d6zil"}, "id": "319717", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesut_\u00d6zil"}, {"label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}, "id": "331554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}, "id": "331618", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne"}, {"label": {"eng": "Icelanders"}, "id": "345427", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelanders"}, {"label": {"eng": "Assist (football)"}, "id": "367801", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson"}, "id": "372639", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gylfi_Sigur\u00f0sson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}, "id": "393650", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swans (band)"}, "id": "397081", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swans_(band)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 36, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "20:04:00"}

But, in time, there will also be a realisation of the good fortune to have watched one of the finest players ever to wear a white shirt in his pomp.\n\nWhatever the Iceland international does, or does not, achieve at Goodison Park and beyond, there can be no denying the best football of his career to date has come in a Swansea jersey.\n\nIf you include his loan spell during the club's first Premier League campaign, he has scored 37 goals in 130 appearances. He departs as Swansea's record top-flight scorer, nine of his goals came last season in addition to 13 assists.\n\nHe was, and remains, a deadly set-piece operator, whether setting his own sights at goal or providing the ammunition for others.\n\nTo witness him in action has been to see one of the very best players the Premier League has to offer. His performances in a struggling team last season passed muster when compared to the likes of Christian Eriksen, Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne - all of whom were in the skirmish for silverware at the other end of the table.\n\nNot that those facts will make his departure any easier to bear. If anything, they just highlight what a significant loss Sigurdsson is, not to mention the task that lies ahead in finding a replacement.\n\nFor their part, it is hard to know what more Swansea could have done in this particular transfer saga. They have rejected several offers and attempted to steer away interest, pushing the asking price North in an effort to keep hold of their star man.\n\nBut, when Sigurdsson told them he would not travel to America for their pre-season tour, the writing was on the wall.\n\nThere will be those who would say Swansea should have played hardball, and told a player with three years remaining on his contract that he was going absolutely nowhere.\n\nIn theory, that is fine, and it should be said that his late withdrawal from the trip was out of keeping with the professionalism and attitude he has shown during his time in SA1.\n\nBut it would have done neither party any good to have a man on the books with no desire to be at the club. Some will say it is a sad state of affairs that a player can hold that sort of power given they are club employees. They have a point, but nevertheless it is a reality of football in the 21st century.\n\nThe fact is, the deal is done and nothing can be done about that now. Instead it is worth taking a moment to pause and reflect on a Swansea career of the very-highest calibre.\n\nNot just in terms of quality, but in effort and sweat. No-one can doubt Sigurdsson gave anything other than his absolute all to the Swansea cause.\n\nHe ran himself into the ground for the Swans, last season he covered the most ground of any player, in any position, at any club in the Premier League.\n\nWithout him, you fancy Swansea would no longer be a top-flight club, that they would have succumbed to the drop in one of the last two seasons.\n\nThe ending may have left a bitter taste, but he could not have done much more.\n\nHe provided several moments of breathtaking brilliance to savour for years to come.\n\nFrom the free-kick at Wigan in his first spell, signalling that he was a sterling acquisition, to his final set-piece special at Old Trafford.It's difficult to pick a favourite goal or moment.\n\nThink of the free-kick to inspire the come-from-behind success over Arsenal in 2014, twice befuddling Wayne Hennessey from dead-ball situations in successive seasons at the Liberty.\n\nThere was a fantastic strike in a losing FA Cup cause at Blackburn, a wonderful controlled volley against Chelsea, a key finish in a home win over Norwich, the completion of a sweeping team move at Fulham.\n\nIn the end there are simply too many to list in one go, but one that stands out for this writer came during the crazy 5-4 win over Crystal Palace on a barmy night at the Liberty in November, and it had nothing to do with the stellar free-kick he tucked away.\n\nDuring the second half, Sigurdsson effortlessly brought down a high ball, killing it dead in one touch as Conor Wickham closed in near the touchline just inside the Palace half.\n\nSigurdsson feinted one way, then the other, stepped over the ball and feinted again. Wickham bought the dummy - Sigurdsson had barely taken a touch other than to bring the ball out of the air - and, realising his error, tried to readjust as the Swans man moved away from him.\n\nThe striker collapsed in a heap, having suffered a knee injury in trying to shift his weight back after being fooled by Sigurdsson.\n\nIt was cruel, and terribly unfortunate for poor Wickham, but it was an incredible exhibition of what Sigurdsson can to and the talent he possesses.\n\nSigurdsson made a fellow professional in one of Europe's top leagues look like a clumsy parks player rather than the quality top-flight striker Wickham is.\n\nNot many players can do that. It was brilliant and it was brutal.\n\nDebate has raged over the price tag. Is he worth \u00a340million, \u00a345million or \u00a350million?\n\nIn truth no-one is, but in the current market the figures spent elsewhere this summer suggest Swansea were more than within their rights to wring as much as they could from the deal.\n\nBut, when the furore dies down and time passes, all that will be left will be priceless memories of one of Swansea City's greatest

transfer saga is almost over after Swansea City and Everton agreed a deal in principle for the Iceland international.\n\nNearly five weeks after Sigurdsson refused to travel on the Swans pre-season tour of America amid interest from the Toffees, he will get his move to Goodison Park.\n\nThe deal is understood to be for a fee of \u00a345million plus add-ons after a compromise was reached to bring the protracted negotiations to an end.\n\nSigurdsson is expected to travel to Merseyside on Wednesday to undergo a medical and complete the formalities of the transfer.\n\nEverton had previously had two bids rejected for the 27-year-old, who manager Ronald Koeman had pursued since his appointment as Toffees boss last summer.\n\nAll sides had become increasingly frustrated at how long it had taken to get a deal in place, with Swans head coach Paul Clement admitting that the process of making further additions to his squad was on hold pending an agreement over Sigurdsson.\n\nNow the Welsh club will be able to press on with plans to bring in new faces after securing a club-record transfer fee for the sale of a player.\n\nManchester City striker Wilfried Bony, West Brom's Nacer Chadli and Stoke's Joe Allen are the three leading targets for Clement and the Swans hierarchy, with the club hoping to seal deals for the first two names on that list in short order.\n\nSigurdsson has not played for the Swans since his sole pre-season outing against Barnet.\n\nIt was in the aftermath of that game that he informed Clement that he did not feel in the right frame of mind to travel with the rest of the squad.\n\nThe manner of his departure will leave a bitter taste for Swans fans as a player who, as recently as May, had spoken of being happy to remain at the Liberty if the club wanted to keep him.\n\nHis actions last month belied those words but he will leave a huge void to be filled in the closing weeks of the transfer window.\n\nSigurdsson scored nine goals and created 13 more last season, he was Swansea's player of the yea in each of the previous two seasons.\n\nHe is the club's record top-flight goalscorer with 34, and his craft and guile were solely missed as Swansea kicked off the new season with a goalless draw at Southampton last weekend.\n\nBut the hope will be that Swansea can bring in the attacking acquisitions Clement has spoken of as the window enters its final fortnight.", "id": "9349358", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Swansea City and Everton agree deal in principle for Sigurdsson", "image":

A productive five months in south Wales followed, with the attacking midfielder even scooping the Premier League Player of the Month award for March for his performances.\n\nA permanent transfer to the Swans collapsed, allowing Tottenham Hotspur to swoop and secure Sigurdsson's signature for a fee of \u00a38.8m.\n\nHe spent two seasons at White Hart Lane, scoring eight goals in 58 top-flight appearances, but then rejoined the Swans for a second spell as part of an exchange deal that saw defender Ben Davies go in the opposite direction.\n\nAnd having returned to the Swans, Sigurdsson once again became a key man thanks to his ability to score and create goals, as well his willingness to put in a shift for his team.\n\nHe was named Swans Player of the Year in both 2015/16 and 2016/17, while also becoming a firm fans' favourite at the Liberty Stadium.\n\nHe scored nine goals and contributed 13 assists as Swansea beat the drop in dramatic fashion in his last season in Wales.\n\nOn the international stage, the 6ft 1in midfielder starred for Iceland as they reached the last 16 of Euro 2016.\n\nContracted until: June 2022", "id": "9552222", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16",

And it is no coincidence that as he's been forced to take more gambles in the market, he's attempted to mitigate the risk by returning to the contacts, players and the mentality that he knows best.\n\nBenitez is fully aware that Javier Manquillo comes to Newcastle after so-so loan spells with Sunderland and Liverpool. He knows that Joselu was unable to get in the Stoke squad and Mikel Merino had a stop-start season in the Bundesliga.\n\nBut he feels that he knows how to motivate players who came through the same Spanish system that he spent his early managerial career - and much of his embryonic professional life - working in. He feels that he knows how they think - and he'll be able to give them the right message to shock them back into some kind of form if their levels drop.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nBenitez's initial thoughts have always been to sign English players who know the league, but they have arrived with a sizeable premium this summer. The Tammy Abraham transfer, for example, was too expensive despite his lack of first team experience. Andre Gray and Harry Maguire were priced out of Newcastle's horizons early in the market.\n\nSo that left Newcastle looking to either the next tier of English players or overseas gambles. And Benitez feels it's better to go with what you know than take a risk on a player from another European league whose personality may be more difficult to unpick during what is a long season.\n\nWhile it might have been easy to bill this as a Spanish revolution - succeeding the French revolution that didn't get Newcastle far in the end - the truth is that it's more the case of the manager managing the resources he has. It's an interesting subplot into how Benitez has recalibrated his own expectations this season - and why it still feels unlikely that the manager will walk away.\n\nWhile national pundits have gravely predicted he won't last until Christmas, it feels highly unlikely - if you know the man - that he would walk away from this challenge and let down his squad and the city.\n\n\"What we have different to other Premier League clubs is the city behind the team. 52,000 behind the team,\" Benitez says.\n\n\"We have everything but because the money is so big in the Premier League now, it's not just (about) that. You need to do the right things in the other departments. If you make a couple of mistakes in the scouting department, it can cost you millions and you can't recover.\n\n\"The other teams: 75% of their squad is there. They have Premier League experience so they need three players. We knew that we needed more players, the question is could we get the players we wanted?\n\n\"Now we need to make sure we're improving the team, improving the squad. Some of the targets we had and players we were considering, teams at the bottom of the table paid \u00a320-25million for them. It was not normal but it has happened. It's the market.\n\n\"If you want to compete at the same level, you have to go to the market. I'm not saying whether this is fair or not. To me it's crazy. What we could have done to save some money, we didn't do it and now we're in a worse position. But still, I have confidence that if everything is fine, we can compete.\n\n\"One thing that I have - and I said it last year, and in the end we were right - is that we will compete to the end. Last year I said carry on and we won the last three games and won the title. Great. At Liverpool we won 10 and drew one of our last 11 games.\n\n\"In the Premier League you lose some games at the beginning and people are panicking. I don't want people panicking. You need to be consistent until the end, working to the very end. We will get better and better.\"\n\nThere's a measure of pressure on Newcastle to get points on the board early in the season, but Benitez is clear that there has to be calm this term - whatever happens.\n\n\"If we win three games in a row it'll be 'We have to win the title', if we lose three it'll be 'Oh, we are already relegated',\" he said.\n\n\"What I want it to be sure that my players realise that every game is going to be a challenge. Get three points, on to the next one. One game at a time - if we have this idea it'll be easier for us.\"\n\nMaking a tough situation easier has been a key theme for Benitez this summer. He will hope the signing of Joselu helps.\n\nRead More Newcastle United Transfer News", "id": "9329665", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Why NUFC have signed Spanish players this summer - and what it means", "image": "http://i4.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13344563.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/LAP_NEC_170717carton_09JPG.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "85691", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "id": "303465", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}, "id": "303577", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}, "id": "306188", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}, "id": "306279", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}, "id": "307098", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}, "id": "311810", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}, "id": "315069", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}, "id": "315885", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga"}, {"label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}, "id": "317441", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}, "id": "322883", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "First team"}, "id": "361621", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_association_football_terms#F"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joselu"}, "id": "373517", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}, "id": "398955", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire"}, {"label": {"eng": "Javier Manquillo"}, "id": "407194", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Manquillo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Andre Gray"}, "id": "442607", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Gray"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 435, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 567, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 751, "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1063, "label": "dmoz/Games/Yard, Deck, and Table Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Yard,_Deck,_and_Table_Games"}], "time": "17:41:00"}

He's unlikely to be ready to play this weekend at Man City but I'd be surprised if he wasn't starting for the Blues by Gameweek 3 or 4.\"\n\nIt's finally gone through. Every summer there's a big transfer saga that lingers on for weeks before finally reaching its inevitable conclusion. When I wrote this piece over a month ago, the Iceland star was just 1/7 to move to Goodison Park. If the odds compilers, who rarely get these things wrong, were so adamant that the move was going to happen then why did it take a full month for it to go through?\n\nEither way, Everton got their man in the end and there wasn't that much damage done. He's unlikely to be ready to play this weekend at Man City but I'd be surprised if he wasn't starting for the Blues by Gameweek 3 or 4.\n\nAll well and good for Everton but where does this leave Swansea?\n\nIan Rush, who knows a thing or two about these matters said, \"In my personal opinion, I think Sigurdsson is irreplaceable. To lose that creativity, there isn't a player like that at Swansea at the moment.\"\n\nThat sounds about right and Paul Clement is now facing a nightmare scenario. He's lost his best player and whereas he may have money to replace him (or as close to that as possible) he's now lacking that other priceless commodity: time.\n\nThe [3.0] on Swansea to go down is looking good.\n\nOne of the more interesting aspects of modern-day football. There was another example of it today with Jese Rodriguez arriving at Stoke on loan from PSG which triggered the sale of Joselu to Newcastle. The Neymar exit leading to the Eriksen/Coutinho/Dembele arrival is still ongoing.\n\nWhat was meant to happen was that Ross Barkley left to Tottenham as Sigurdsson arrived and everyone was happy. But the England man's injury for up to six weeks has put a real spanner in the works. Spurs may decide there's little value in buying him now when they can't count on him till October. And Daniel Levy is smart enough to know that the longer the player goes unsold without signing a new contract, the cheaper he'll be. He's certainly not the 1/6 chance to move to White Hart Lane that he was a month ago.\n\nWhen Juventus sold Zinedine Zidane to Real Madrid almost two decades ago, they used the money (plus a bit more) to go out and buy Gianluigi Buffon, Lilian Thuram, Pavel Nedved and Marcelo Salas. Not bad business. A few titles followed their arrival.\n\nNow I'm not suggesting that the purchases of Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Davy Klassen, Sandro and Sigurdsson plus the free transfer signings Wayne Rooney and Cuco Martina are quite of the same standard as those four Juve got.\n\nBut it's hard to argue that between them they've more than made up for the exit of Romelu Lukaku. Few would also argue that this is Everton's best-ever squad in the Premier League era. [4.1] on the Toffees finishing Top 6 with Liverpool, Arsenal and even Chelsea looking rather vulnerable? Yes, please.\n\nIf Barkley stays at the club it will be virtually impossible to accommodate him, Sigurdsson, Klassen and Rooney into the same side. Not that that isn't a nice problem to have.\n\nWhat it might all mean is that Everton call it a day in terms of this transfer window and stop their pursuit of Olivier Giroud, valued at around \u00a320 million.\n\nYou could then have the busy Idrissa Gueye doing most of the running and tackling, Klassen in the so-called Number 8 position performing both offensive and defensive work and Sigurdsson playing either as an inside left forward or as a more traditional playmaker rather than in-the-hole, which would be a little further up the pitch.\n\nRooney would then play in-the-hole behind Sandro with any one of Morgan Schneiderlin, Tom Davies, Kevin Mirallas, Yannick Bolasie or Barkley being the 11th player depending on what system Ronald Koeman decides to play and how attacking he wants the side to be.\n\nThe nice thing for him is that Sigurdsson, Rooney and Barkley can all play in different positions. For example, both Rooney and the Iceland man could also play as a false number 9 if Sandro isn't available.\n\nIt should also mean the end of a 3-5-2 or 3-4-2-1 system being deployed for the simple reason that Everton have too many riches in midfield to only play three of them.\n\nExciting times ahead if you're a Toffee.", "id": "9490680", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Premier

such as Gladstone Pottery Museum - to her liking after having to put up with Madrid and Paris.\n\nAt least she knows the people there have a great sense of humour.\n\nThe club today poked fun at former striker Mark Arnautovic after he claimed he joined West Ham because they are a club with more ambition.", "id": "9505060", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Jese Rodriguez is the Stoke striker who has reggaeton alter ego named 'Jey M' and dates stunning model Aurah Ruiz", "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/sport-preview-jese-rodriguez1.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=620&h=413&crop=1", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "67", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "113913", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "149322", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "label": {"eng": "Comunidad de Madrid"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rapping"}, "id": "302550", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping"}, {"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "YouTube"}, "id": "302574", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"label": {"eng": "Music industry"}, "id": "302844", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Record label"}, "id": "302847", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label"}, {"label": {"eng": "Instagram"}, "id": "303287", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bikini"}, "id": "303654", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini"}, {"label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "id": "303711", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}, "id": "304435", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107"}, "id": "306182", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Ibrahimovi\u0107"}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}, "id": "309177", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Music video"}, "id": "309939", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}, "id": "322883", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Bet365"}, "id": "351261", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet365"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reggaeton"}, "id": "379455", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggaeton"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 55, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}], "time": "15:03:00"}

Nick Wright examines what could be the toughest challenge of his managerial career with help from one of the players who knows him best.\n\nRafael Benitez was eager to look at the positives after Newcastle's opening day defeat to Tottenham, praising his side's hard work and citing Jonjo Shelvey's sending off as the turning point. \"It was a great effort against a good team,\" he told Sky Sports. \"It was a pity that everything changed.\"\n\nHuddsf'ld vs Newcastle\n\nAugust 20, 2017, 12:30pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\nThe Spaniard will wonder what might have been if it wasn't for Shelvey's moment of madness, but the game also served as a reminder of the size of the task ahead. Newcastle only mustered one shot on goal before going down to 10 men. Benitez now faces three games without Shelvey and more still without injured defenders Paul Dummett and Florian Lejeune.\n\nIt is far from ideal after a frustrating summer in the transfer market. Spanish striker Joselu became Newcastle's sixth senior signing of the window when he sealed his \u00a35m switch from Stoke this week, but Benitez has made no secret of the fact that he expected more financial backing.\n\nMike Ashley promised to invest \"every last penny\" in the team when Newcastle clinched promotion last year, but expenditure has only just exceeded the \u00a330m fee they received for Moussa Sissoko last summer. In an interview with Sky Sports last week, the Newcastle owner insisted further signings will depend on player sales.\n\nIt's a blow to Benitez, whose existing squad only won the Championship thanks to Brighton's late-season slump, but his response has been one of defiance. \"I am not happy but for me it is a challenge,\" he said last week. \"Every manager wants to improve and have better players, but at the same time I am happy with the players I have because the team spirit was good last season.\"\n\nBenitez's determination to succeed at Newcastle is welcome news to the club and their supporters, and it comes as no surprise to those who know him best. \"What fans want above all is that you give everything for the shirt,\" former Spain winger Luis Garcia, who played under Benitez at Liverpool and Tenerife, tells Sky Sports.\n\nHe is protective of his players and his club. He always gives his best and Newcastle are seeing that now.\n\nLuis Garcia on Rafael Benitez\n\n\"Wherever Rafa has gone, he has always given everything. He has always supported his clubs, the charities, everything. He is always totally committed and that's what people love about him. He is protective of his players and his club. He always gives his best and Newcastle are seeing that now.\"\n\nGarcia, who won the Champions League with Benitez in 2005, has followed his old manager's Newcastle tenure closely. \"I sent him a message to congratulate him on promotion,\" he says. \"He's done a great job. It's difficult to be relegated and come back after only one year, especially when important players leave. Now he's trying to build a strong team because he knows it's going to be another tough year.\"\n\nA tough year becomes tougher in light of Newcastle's financial constraints, and the lack of star signings means Benitez's coaching abilities have taken on even more importance. This is not the first time the former Valencia and Liverpool manager has been asked to get the best out of what he's got. The question is whether he can achieve it again.\n\n\"He's the same manager he ever was,\" says Garcia. \"You cannot talk to Rafa about anything except football. Football is everything. Talking, learning and improving. He attends to every detail. Everything has to be under control. He loves that. He wants you to have the right preparations, the right rest, the right food, the right everything. New players have to adapt fast to the needs of the team.\"\n\nIt's up to Benitez to find the right chemistry on the training field, but the lack of firepower in attack is a separate concern. The Magpies scored 16 goals in 10 Premier League games under the Spaniard at the end of the 2015/16 campaign, but nine of those came from players who have since departed.\n\nDwight Gayle was prolific in the Championship but is yet to show the same kind of consistency in the top flight. Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze Perez have scored just 22 Premier League goals in 104 appearances between them. Then there's new signing Joselu, who only found the net four times for Stoke last season and has never reached double figures for league goals in a single campaign.\n\nIt's easy to see why Benitez was so upset by Newcastle's failure to land Tammy Abraham, and now there are problems at the other end as well. Lejeune and Ciaran Clark marshalled Harry Kane impressively for the opening half hour on Sunday, but the Frenchman's ankle ligament damage leaves Benitez with another headache.\n\nFor an ambitious manager accustomed to competing at the top, it is unfamiliar territory. \"I know Rafa and I know he will not be planning just to fight to stay in the Premier League,\" says Garcia. \"I think he will be wanting to aim high, to try to get into those 10 positions at the top of the table and maybe fight for the Europa League places.\"\n\nBenitez can aim high and look at the positives, but much will depend on what happens in the remaining weeks of the transfer window. Right now, with Newcastle's squad in its current state and funds as limited as they are, the season ahead looks like an uphill battle.\n\nAlso See: Your club's record attendance Talks set for transfer

It's very rare messages come out of our club,\" added Dyche.\n\nElsewhere, Swansea have made an approach to Hull for midfielder Sam Clucas, according to Sky sources.\n\nHull are keen to retain Clucas as they target an immediate return to the Premier League and have so far rejected two bids from Burnley, with the second bid worth up to \u00a310m.\n\nSwansea manager Paul Clement wants to strengthen his squad following the \u00a345m departure of Gylfi Sigurdsson to Everton and is also targeting the signings of Wilfried Bony, Joe Allen and Nacer Chadli.\n\nClucas, who missed just one match in the Premier League last season, is contracted at the KCOM stadium until 2019 having signed a new three-year contract last August.\n\nFinally, Everton manager Ronald Koeman said he expects Gylfi Sigurdsson to boost the club's goal-scoring options after the attacking-midfielder completed his club- record move from Swansea City.\n\nSigurdsson signed a five-year contract after the two clubs agreed a fee, which British media reported to be around ($A73.5 million). The 27-year-old, who underwent a medical on Wednesday morning, played a key part in Swansea avoiding relegation last season, scoring nine goals and 13 assists.\n\n\"We worked a long time to get this deal in and he was one of the key players to bring in,\" Koeman told a news conference before the Europa League first-leg playoff against Croatian side Hajduk Split on Thursday.\n\n\"We knew we would lose (Romelu) Lukaku for this season and we need players who bring productivity to the team.\"\n\nLukaku moved to Manchester United last month, for a reported transfer fee of $A122.4 million.\n\nSigurdsson \"is the type of player with a lot of productivity,\" Koeman said. \"In my opinion, he is one of the best in the Premier League.\" The Iceland international is Everton's eighth new signing of the close season and he is eager to repay Koeman's faith in him.\n\n\"Hopefully I will continue to create goals and score goals for the team and contribute to the kind of success we're seeking at the club,\" he told evertontv. \"This is an ambitious club and it is clear we are moving in a really good direction.\n\n\"The most important thing is that this team keeps winning games and climbing the table - and does that throughout the season.\" The manager also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered in training last week. Barkley, who is in the final year of his contract, refused a new deal at the club and Koeman said last month he would be sold in the current transfer window. \"He stopped training last Monday,\" Koeman said.\n\n\"It looks like a hamstring injury, but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.\"", "id": "9792791", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17",

Benitez wants to see the Kenedy deal done in the coming days but is also still keen on signing a goalkeeper.\n\nWest Ham's Adrian is on the wanted list but purchasing a goalkeeper has been complicated by the Tim Krul situation at Benton. Benitez has been told he can only bring in a keeper once Krul has left the club.\n\nKrul, who has been linked with Benfica and Crystal Palace in recent days, told United he wanted to stay on Tyneside and is in no hurry to leave the club.\n\nRead More Newcastle United Transfer News", "id": "9491738", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "What next for NUFC in the transfer window?", "image": "http://i2.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13485016.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Chelsea-ICC-Singapore-Arrivals.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "85691", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}, "id": "303026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}, "id": "303977", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}, "id": "306188", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}, "id": "306192", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}, "id": "306194", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}, "id": "306200", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}, "id": "306279", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Real Madrid C.F."}, "id": "306281", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"label": {"eng": "S.L.

four European Cup winners with Manchester City having three\n\nStoke City have completed the season-long loan signing of Jese Rodriguez from Paris Saint-Germain, and the Spaniard's arrival has brought with it an unlikely stat.\n\nJese has won the Champions League twice in his career with Real Madrid, making Stoke currently boast more winners of the European Cup than any other Premier League side.\n\nThe 24-year-old joins new Bojan, Xherdan Shaqiri, Ibrahim Afellay and Darren Fletcher in having won Europe's most coveted prize during their career meaning Mark Hughes can select from a squad boasting five Champions League winners.\n\nStoke City's squad now contains five Champions League winners after Jese Rodriguez signed\n\nJese played a role in Real Madrid's 2014 and 2016 wins before he moved to Paris Saint-Germain\n\nIbrahim Afellay was a member of the Barcelona squad to prosper in the 2010-11 season\n\nStoke could have had a staggering seven players to have tasted success in Europe's premier cup competition had they not sold Marko Arnautovic to West Ham and loaned out Marc Muniesa to Girona earlier this summer.\n\nIt is an unlikely statistic given the club's standing in the top flight, with the Premier League elite currently left in their wake when it comes to Champions League medals within their respective squads.\n\nChelsea are next with four winners with David Luiz, Gary Cahill, Alvaro Morata (twice at Real Madrid) and Pedro (three times at Barcelona) having the trophy among their club honours, with the Blues having won it in 2012.\n\nManchester City currently have three players to have won the Champions League with Danilo and Claudio Bravo having done so with Real and Barca respectively and Yaya Toure to have done the same at the Nou Camp before his move.\n\nPedro enjoyed lifted the European Cup three times as part of the dominant Barcelona team\n\nSTOKE LEAD THE WAY\n\nStoke City - 5\n\nChelsea - 4\n\nManchester City - 3\n\nManchester United, Everton, Southampton - 2\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, West Ham - 1\n\nManchester United will look to go far in the competition this year under Jose Mourinho, but he can only look to two players - Michael Carrick and Juan Mata - for experience of past glories on the biggest European stage.\n\nIt is the same number as at Southampton, where Ryan Bertrand played for Chelsea in the penalty shootout success over Bayern Munich in the final while Oriol Romeu was named on the substitutes' bench that night at the Allianz Arena.\n\nThe summer spree at Everton has coincided with them bolstering their own Champions League winners with Sandro Ramirez (Barcelona, 2014-15) and Wayne Rooney (United, 2007-08) to have played roles in previous triumphs.\n\nDarren Fletcher (far right) is another player at Stoke to have won the Champions League\n\nLiverpool striker Daniel Sturridge lifted the top prize at Chelsea after beating Bayern Munich\n\nArsenal have frequently faltered at the last 16 stage against sides more experienced in winning the competition, and the Gunners contain just one player to have lifted the Champions League.\n\nGoalkeeper Petr Cech was at Chelsea in 2012 as part of Roberto Di Matteo's unlikely success, meaning Arsene Wenger can call upon the same number of European Cup winners as West Ham and Liverpool.\n\nDaniel Sturridge is the sole Champions League medal holder at Anfield, while Arnautovic's move to the London Stadium provides the Hammers with European pedigree after the Austrian won the trophy albeit in a bit-part role at Inter Milan (2009-10) under

Photograph: Paul Childsdetails/Action Images via Reuters\n\nArsenal risk losing striker Alexis Sanchez for free next season, according to manager Arsene Wenger, who confirmed the club have made no progress on a new contract for the Chilean striker.\n\nSanchez, 28, is currently in the final year of his contract. He has been linked with a move to Paris St Germain in the current transfer window.\n\n\"We have not progressed on that front,\" Wenger said in a news conference before Arsenal head to StokeCity on Saturday.\n\n\"At the moment, he is a player who goes into the final year of his contract and prepares for the season. We have not made any progress on the other front.\n\n\"It's not an ideal situation on the financial side and it demands some sacrifice ... but it doesn't mean the players who are in the final year of their contract will not extend their contract. We will work on that as well.\"\n\nWenger said Sanchez is still recovering from an abdominal strain but is expected to regain full fitness before the club's match in Liverpool on August 27.\n\n\"For Sanchez, it (Stoke) looks a little early, but he works hard in training,\" Wenger added. \"He should be available for next game against Liverpool.\n\n\"His recovery is going very well, he is working very hard. But you have to be very cautious. It was a muscle strain and (you have to be wary) not to have any setback on it.\"\n\nThe manager confirmed midfielders Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who are also in the final year of their contracts, are firmly in his plans for the current season.\n\nWilshere returned to action from a fractured leg during Arsenal Under-23's 3-2 win over DerbyCounty earlier this week.\n\n\"It's good that he is back and available,\" Wenger said.\n\n\"I think he needs games now. He might play again on Monday night. He is not far away now.\"\n\nArsenal began their campaign with a 4-3 home victory over LeicesterCity last weekend.\n\nBlow for Palace as Zaha ruled out for four weeks\n\nIMAGE: Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace in action. Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images\n\nCrystalPalace winger Wilfried Zaha has been ruled out for four weeks after injuring his right knee in his team's 3-0 home defeat by promoted HuddersfieldTown in their opening Premier League game of the season on Saturday.\n\nThe Ivory Coast international, who has been Palace's Player of the Year for the last two seasons and signed a new five-year deal in May, left SelhurstPark with his knee in a brace and his absence is a major setback for manager Frank de Boer.\n\nBritish media reported that Zaha, who played the full 90 minutes, is likely to be out until after the upcoming international break and would miss Saturday's league trip to Liverpool and the home game against SwanseaCity on Aug. 26.\n\nThe 24-year-old would also miss a League Cup fixture against IpswichTown on Aug. 22 and Ivory Coast's home and away World Cup qualifiers against Gabon on Sept. 2 and Sept. 5, the reports said.\n\nPalace battled relegation all of last season, only narrowly avoiding the drop under then manager Sam Allardyce. The shock defeat by Huddersfield leaves them second-bottom in the table, above only West Ham United, after the opening round of fixtures.\n\nStoke sign forward Rodriguez on loan from PSG\n\nStoke City have signed forward Jese Rodriguez on a season-long loan from France's Paris St Germain, making him the Premier League side's sixth recruit of the transfer window.\n\nThe 24-year-old moved to PSG from Real Madrid for 22 million pounds ($28.3 million) at the start of last season but failed to settle. He scored twice in nine appearances before being loaned to Spanish side Las Palmas for the second half of the season.\n\nBefore joining PSG, Rodriguez spent nine seasons at Real, scoring 12 times in 62 La Liga appearances. He won the Champions League in 2014 and 2016 before a knee injury stalled his progress.\n\n\"He hasn't had the happiest of periods in his career in Paris, but he's still only a young man and is hungry to make a big impression in the Premier League,\" Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes told the club's website (www.stokecityfc.com).\n\nRodriguez follows Darren Fletcher, Kurt Zouma, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, Bruno Martins Indi and Josh Tymon to the club.\n\nStoke, who host Arsenal in the league on Saturday, were beaten 1-0 by Everton in their season opener at the weekend.\n\nKoeman backs record signing Sigurdsson to boost Everton attack\n\nEverton manager Ronald Koeman said he expects Gylfi Sigurdsson to boost the club's goal-scoring options after the attacking-midfielder completed his medical before he transfers from SwanseaCity.\n\nSigurdsson will move to GoodisonPark after the two clubs agreed a fee of about 45 million pounds ($57.84 million), a record for Everton, according to the British media.\n\nThe 27-year-old played a key part in Swansea's avoiding relegation last season, scoring nine goals and 13 assists.\n\n\"The latest is that he had his medical this morning. What I heard from the doctor was no problem,\" Koeman told a news conference before the Europa League first-leg playoff against Croatian side Hajduk Split on Thursday.\n\n\"We worked a long time to get this deal in and he was one of the key players to bring in. We knew would lose Lukaku for this season and we need players who bring productivity to the team.\n\nRomelu Lukaku moved to Manchester United last month, for a reported transfer fee of 75 million pounds.\n\nSigurdsson \"is the type of player with a lot of productivity, Koeman said. \"In my opinion, he is one of the best in the Premier League.\"\n\nThe manager also confirmed he is still waiting to find out the extent of a hamstring injury midfielder Ross Barkley suffered in training last week.\n\nBarkley, who is in the final year of his contract, refused a new deal at the club and Koeman said last month he would be sold in the current transfer window.\n\n\"He stopped training last Monday,\" Koeman said. \"It looks like a hamstring injury, but he needs to do more tests today and tomorrow to know exactly what the injury is.\"\n\nFollowing their Europa League encounter at GoodisonPark, Everton visit ManchesterCity in the league on Monday.\n\nGundogan returns in Man City friendly after eight-month layoff\n\nIlkay Gundogan made his first appearance in eight months for ManchesterCity on Tuesday when he came on as a second-half substitute against Girona in a friendly in Spain.\n\nThe German midfielder, who suffered knee ligament damage against Watford last December, could be in contention for a place in the squad for Monday's home tie against Everton.\n\nGirona beat City 1-0, with the 26-year-old coming on as a substitute in the 71st minute.\n\nCity beat promoted Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0 in their Premier League opener on Saturday.", "id": "9508134",

Is that good enough for a club at the size of Newcastle? No, as far as I am concerned.\n\n\"So I am 100% behind Rafa Benitez . He has done his job, got them back into the Premier League at the first time of asking. You have banked god knows how many millions for being in the Premier League, or you will bank it over the next few years, now invest it and back me as a manager.\n\n\"I am with him all the way. It makes no sense to not go for it and protect your status. Not only that, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at what they have got and say it is not enough. I suppose Newcastle fans and even Rafa are probably only asking for signings to give them a better chance.\n\n\"Right now, they are amongst the bottom three teams. He wants a chance to survive and that's all he's asking for. If they don't get it, they could lose their most important person and that's Rafa Benitez.\"\n\nJenas who played with Alan Shearer and Craig Bellamy in the Champions League as United battled for the Premier League title, knows a thing or two about strikers.\n\nAnd the now TV pundit, who turns out on BT Sport and Match of the Day, feels that missing out on Tammy Abraham, and the lack of goals from Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze Perez could cost United in the long run.\n\n\"I don't think they have got enough goals, [Aleksandar] Mitrovic has had his season in the league below,\" He continued. \"I didn't see enough from him. Maybe they didn't play to his strengths or maybe it was just his ability, I don't see him getting double figures.\n\n\"They have Dwight Gayle , a proven goalscorer for them but the problem with Gayle is that he has to play in a two [forward system], then you are restricted with how you play. He is better with someone next to him in the Premier League but they won't have a lot of possession in games.\n\n\"They have Ayoze Perez as well but there's not enough there for me. Every year when I am talking about football in the last couple of seasons, looking at Sunderland, Villa and others. The relegated team's biggest problem is always a lack of ability to score goals.\n\n\"You can grind out results but if you can't score goals, you won't stay up. They even failed to loan Tammy Abraham. As a Newcastle United fan or manager or player, you expect a player to jump to play at Newcastle. He has gone to Swansea and you hope that's a situation that doesn't come back to bite you in the rear end.\"\n\nRead More Newcastle United Transfer News", "id": "9758309", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Jermaine Jenas almost feels 'sick' at lack of backing at NUFC", "image": "http://i1.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13493312.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Queens-Park-Rangers-v-Norwich-City-Premier-League.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "id": "302552", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}, "id": "304434", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}, "id": "304606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Premier League"}, "id": "305673", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}, "id": "305737", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Football League Championship"}, "id": "306186", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship"}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}, "id": "306188", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rafael Ben\u00edtez"}, "id": "306279", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben\u00edtez"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dwight Gayle"}, "id": "306283", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Gayle"}, {"label": {"eng": "St James' Park"}, "id": "306285", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James'_Park"}, {"label": {"eng": "Promotion and relegation"}, "id": "306288", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}, "id": "307098", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}, "id": "307959", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window"}, {"label": {"eng": "Football League Two"}, "id": "309294", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Two"}, {"label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}, "id": "311804", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jermaine Jenas"}, "id": "313160", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Jenas"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swansea City A.F.C."}, "id": "317224", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_City_A.F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}, "id": "317441", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C."}, {"label": {"eng": "Craig Bellamy"}, "id": "317524", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Bellamy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tyneside"}, "id": "323015", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyneside"}, {"label": {"eng": "Match of the Day"}, "id": "358024", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_of_the_Day"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joselu"}, "id": "373517", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}, "id": "393471", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 47, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "time": "19:01:00"}

El conjunto 'Potter' es quien cuenta con un mayor n\u00famero de jugadores en la Premier que han conseguido al menos una Champions League con hasta cinco futbolistas, dos de ellos ex-azulgranas. Adem\u00e1s del canario, tambi\u00e9n Bojan, Afellay, Shaqiri y Fletcher cuentan con el trofeo de mayor prestigio en Europa en su palmar\u00e9s.\n\nNo deja de ser llamativo que un club que jam\u00e1s ha disputado esta competici\u00f3n ocupe el primer lugar por delante de clubes como Chelsea (con 4 futbolistas), Manchester City (3), Manchester United (2) o Liverpool (1) -equipo que cuenta con 5 Champions League en su haber-.\n\nDarren Fletcher fue el primero en conseguir el mayor t\u00edtulo europeo. En la temporada 2007-08 en el Manchester United, el centrocampista consigui\u00f3 levantar el trofeo tras una ag\u00f3nica tanda de penaltis ante el Chelsea. El futbolista ingl\u00e9s ha recalado este mismo verano en el Stoke con la carta de libertad procedente del West Brom.\n\nLa temporada siguiente fue el turno del Barcelona, que se proclam\u00f3 campe\u00f3n tras vencer precisamente al United por dos tantos a cero. Aquella plantilla contaba con Bojan Krkic, quien dos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde repiti\u00f3 \u00e9xito al conseguir la Champions del 2010-11 de nuevo ante los 'red devils'. El delantero fich\u00f3 en 2014 desde el club cul\u00e9 y ha retornado a Stoke-on-Trent tras su cesi\u00f3n la temporada pasada en el Mainz 05. All\u00ed Bojan hizo historia al ser el primer espa\u00f1ol en marcar en las cuatro grandes ligas.\n\nEn aquel segundo triunfo europeo coincidi\u00f3 con Ibrahim Afellay. El holand\u00e9s levant\u00f3 aquella Champions que le dej\u00f3 un gran sabor de boca, siendo protagonista en las semifinales contra el Real Madrid. El internacional lleg\u00f3 libre al Stoke en 2015 procedente del Bar\u00e7a tras salir por la puerta de atr\u00e1s del club azulgrana.\n\nEn el a\u00f1o 2012-13 qui\u00e9n rein\u00f3 en el viejo continente fue el Bayern de M\u00fanich. El club b\u00e1varo venci\u00f3 en una final con acento alem\u00e1n al Borussia Dortmund por un apretado 2-1. Xherdan Shaqiri formaba parte de aquella plantilla siendo un suplente de lujo por detr\u00e1s de Arjen Robben. Hace dos temporadas dej\u00f3 el Inter de Mil\u00e1n para convertirse en \u00eddolo de los 'Potters' siendo un traspaso r\u00e9cord para el club (17 millones de euros).\n\nEl \u00faltimo en sumarse a esta lista es Jes\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez. El extremo jugar\u00e1 como cedido este a\u00f1o en Inglaterra procedente del PSG. El canario, al igual que Bojan, cuenta con dos Champions en su haber. Ambas con el Real Madrid. conseguidas ante el rival de la ciudad, el Atl\u00e9tico. La primera cosechada en 2013-14 y la segunda dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s.\n\nPese al dato, no dejan de ser futbolistas que tuvieron una trascendencia testimonial en los \u00e9xitos cosechados en sus equipos.

{"id": 225041578, "title": "Carlos Sainz warned against joining F1 team - but now looks 'locked in", "text": "Eddie Jordan has warned Carlos Sainz against joining the new Audi Formula 1 project. Sainz needs a new home with his Ferrari seat going to Lewis Hamilton at the end of this season. He was told of that decision a few months ago but has taken his time so far when it comes to deciding his future. Initially he wanted to stay at the front of the grid and a strong start to the season was a boost to his chances of doing that. But Red Bull are likely to offer Sergio Perez a contract extension while he is also not thought to be a serious candidate for the vacant Mercedes seat. Now, his two most likely destinations are sleeping giants Williams and Audi, which is taking over the existing Sauber team. A contract offer from the latter is believed to have been on the table for some time now, with Sainz their number one choice to race alongside Nico Hulkenberg. However, F1 Nation podcast host Tom Clarkson has revealed a conversation with former F1 team owner Jordan and relayed what the Irish businessman said about Sainz's future. He said: \"I did bump into Eddie Jordan yesterday, who I might add it was lovely to see EJ. \"Anyway, I said to him, EJ, you seem to be managing everyone in Formula 1 now because of course Adrian Newey publicly thanked him for his input in what Adrian should be doing next with his life. But also, I had just seen EJ talking to Carlos Sainz Sr so I said to him, 'What advice did you give him?' \"And he said, 'I don't think Sauber's the answer', which I think is interesting.\" The revelation comes after an interview Sainz gave to Channel 4 after the Monaco Grand Prix left presenter Steve Jones to believe that the Spaniard is likely to snub Audi anyway in favour of a Williams move. Sainz said: \"My priority is to want to remain in F1, but also to allow me to find a medium to long-term project where I feel valued, where I feel I'm being listened [to], where I feel like I can commit to a medium or longer term that is going to be useful for my career. \"I believe that just going to some places for one, two years and then leaving is not the right way to approach Formula 1. If you look at successful winning teams, they've been built from the bottom and built a good thing together and I believe in those things and I want to make sure I feel love, valued, that I feel right at home.\" And Jones' analysis of those words was: \"Very graceful. Very classy. I expected nothing less. Just after that interview, the rumours started to swirl that Sainz might be joining Williams. It's really interesting to hear him talk about a long-term project with a team. In short, he's going to Williams. It's locked in.\"", "summary": "Carlos Sainz is searching for a new home on the Formula 1 grid with Ferrari replacing him with Lewis Hamilton at the end of the year, with Audi and Williams the front-runners", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/carlos-sainz-williams-audi-2025-32917583", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32917568.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Monaco-Qualifying.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:51:10", "author": "Daniel Moxon,Daniel-moxon", "authors": ["Daniel Moxon", "Daniel-moxon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.028}

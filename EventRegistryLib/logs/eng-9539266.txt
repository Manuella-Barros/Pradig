The county received $75 million for the project, according to the National Association of Counties.\n\n\"So she hadn't really told you how she spent the money?\" Georgia Senate Majority Leader Bill Cowsert asked later, to which Pitts responded \"no sir.\"\n\nPitts clarified that the budget was for the entire justice system and not just for Willis, and answered affirmatively when asked if his board distributed \"many millions of dollars\" to the district attorney \"to get caught up on a backlog of criminal prosecutions.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"And when you did that, there was no mention of any election integrity case, was there?\" Cowsert asked.\n\n\"I believe that's correct,\" Pitts responded.\n\nWhitmore added that any election integrity case \"for additional resources ... would have come through as an enhancement request.\"\n\n\"So, as a commission, you weren't aware that you were funding an election interference case, certainly not before 2023, which would have been three years after the election?\" Cowsert followed up.\n\n\"I think that's correct,\" Pitts answered.\n\nWillis announced in a letter on February 11, 2021, that she had opened a criminal investigation into Trump for alleged election interference.\n\n\"Whatever part of that $75 million that she received, and how much was used for the backlog, how much was used for the YSL case, how much was used for the election interference case, we don't know. And we're not being given any information, other than with the backlog,\" Pitts said during the hearing. \"That's probably easier to quantify. I don't know how she would give us, or any district attorney, for that matter, would give us a report for how a case is going until it's concluded.\"\n\nPitts confirmed she could have told him how the money was being spent, but did not. He also clarified she was not required to because she is a constitutional officer.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Pitts testified that the board was \"not advised of the hiring of the -- and not that it was required -- of a special prosecutor nor the payment, hourly rate, whatever the rate was.\"\n\n\"We were just following the law and obviously I like to have more information, but that was a law at the time and is the law at the time as I understand the law,\" he said.\n\nWATCH:\n\nWillis appointed Wade in November 2021 and allegedly gave him a \"lucrative\" contract that she benefited from because he took her on trips and cruises using the money he earned from the position, according to the motion.\n\nWillis did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Wade resigned in March.\n\nAthens Republican Sen. Bill Cowsert, chairman of the special investigation panel, said Friday he hopes Willis will appear voluntarily before a state Senate panel that is investigating allegations that Willis committed prosecutorial and financial misconduct.\n\nWillis cannot be sanctioned by the Senate committee, but it can subpoena her to turn over evidence and to testify under oath. Former Gov. Roy Barnes, who declined Willis' offer to serve as special prosecutor in 2021 in the case against Trump, attended Friday's hearing with plans to serve as legal counsel for Willis if she is subpoenaed.\n\n\"She's a key part of the investigation that her viewpoints are valued by us,\" Cowsert said. \"We need to hear what she has to say and her explanation of what she thinks are the appropriate rules ought to be going forward so we don't have this kind of scandal give Georgia a black eye.\"\n\nThe first public accusations that Willis and Wade were romantically linked became public in January in a motion filed by an attorney for Trump co-defendant, Michael Roman, who argued that Wade and Willis' undisclosed relationship improperly financially benefited Willis.\n\nIn April, the Fulton County Commission updated its ethics and anti-nepotism policies to cover elected officials like the district attorney. Under the new rules, all constitutional officers must report any gifts valued at $100 on their financial disclosures. Willis would have been prohibited from having a personal relationship with someone she supervises under the expanded anti-nepotism policy.\n\nCowsert asked Fulton County Attorney Soo Jo if she agreed with his interpretation of the state law, which would seem to imply that Willis would need permission from the County Commission in order to hire an independent contractor such as Wade.\n\nAccording to Jo, previous court rulings have interpreted the law as allowing district attorneys to appoint and determine compensation for special assistant district attorneys without the county board's consent.\n\nShe also said disputes over finances and control usually turn into a tug-of-war between constitutional offices and local elected officials, who set the budget but must also cover shortfalls and legal ramifications.\n\n\"I do believe there are some practical and legal challenges for all counties and elected officials who are in and in between state where you have independence, but you depend on the county for finances,\" Jo said.\n\nCowsert on Friday recommended state legislators consider implementing a statewide policy that addresses tensions between county commissioners and constitutional officers over how much discretion and autonomy they should have.\n\n\"We need to have a state law that provides ethical guidelines for prosecutors, for sheriffs, for clerks of court, for tax commissioners,\" Cowsert said. \"They are not county officers, but they need to have accepted norms of conduct and ethical guidelines. It's our job in the state government to come up with that from the state level.\"\n\nPitts said that the Fulton commission should be able to have more control since the board sets the multimillion dollar budgets.\n\nPitts said that he agrees with prosecutors having the right to determine which cases their office will prosecute, including sweeping racketeering cases like the one Willis is pressing against Trump and his co-defendants. However, he said he believes that the county officials who set the budget should have similar financial control over elected officials like the sheriff, district attorney, tax commissioner, probate court judge and superior court clerks as they have with other local departments.\n\nPitts said that he and other county commissioners were unaware of Willis hiring Wade until it was reported by local media.\n\n\"We give millions of dollars and I think as an elected official with a fiduciary responsibility that I should have the right to know how the money is being spent,\" Pitts said following Friday's committee hearing.\n\nWillis told a crowd at a community outreach event in Atlanta Friday that she finds it interesting that the Republican majority Senate is attacking her credibility at a time when more Black people like herself are being elected as district attorneys in Georgia.\n\nThis year, Willis is seeking a second term as district attorney. Her biggest challenge will be in the May 21 Democratic Party primary when she faces Christian Wise Smith, who's served as Atlanta city solicitor and as a Fulton County prosecutor. The winner of the Democratic primary will have a significant advantage in the Nov. 5 general election in a match up against Courtney Kramer, a self-described MAGA attorney who has worked in the Trump White House. Kramer faces an uphill battle in heavily Democratic Fulton.\n\nWillis said prosecutors and law enforcement have been working closely as part of an increased emphasis on locking up violent criminals and outreach programs that led to a significant drop in Atlanta's crime rate this year.\n\n\"They can look all they want,\" Willis said in a video footage taken by several Atlanta news outlets on Friday. \"The DA's office has done everything according to the books. We are following the law.\"\n\n\"I can prosecute high-profile cases and I can prosecute everyday cases when they need to be prosecuted,\" Willis later said.\n\nThe scandal surrounding Wade and Willis' relationship garnered national headlines as hundreds of thousands of people watched live streams of Wade and Willis testifying at a February hearing on motions from Trump and co-defendants seeking to disqualify Willis from the election interference case on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nWillis has denied any allegations of professional misconduct and misappropriation of government money. Both Wade and Willis testified during the Superior Court hearing that they did not become romantically involved until several months after Wade was hired as a special prosecutor in November 2022 and that they stopped dating in the following summer.\n\nBut critics of Willis not disclosing having a personal relationship have accused the two of taking advantage of Wade being paid about $750,000 by Fulton by splurging on vacations that included a Caribbean cruise and touring wineries in California. To cover her share of vacation expenses, Willis testified that she paid Wade several thousand dollars in cash in order to cover her share of vacation expenses.\n\nFour of the co-defendants pleaded guilty to various charges in the case, while Trump and the remaining 14 defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n\nA Georgia Court of Appeals is expected to render a ruling by May 13 whether to grant a motion by Trump and several of his co-defendants asking the court to review Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee's decision to allow Willis to remain on the case following Wade's resignation. In the March 3 ruling, McAfee wrote that Willis actions showed a tremendous lapse in judgment but that the defense was unable to prove there was conflict of interest that warranted dismissing the case.\n\nSen. Harold Jones, an Augusta Democrat, said that Friday's lengthy committee meeting was a waste of time, arguing Fulton's government website and a few follow up questions could have answered most of the senators' questions.\n\n\"There's nothing that you learned as far as the state Senate committee is concerned except maybe now we're about to start having constitutional officers just change the way they do their budget, a process that has been in effect for over 30 years,\" Jones said. \"I want all constitutional officers to realize that apparently the Georgia State Senate is about to change the law because of one event to happen in Fulton County.\"", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stanley_dunlap@gpb.org", "name":

Bill Cowsert, one of the Republican senators present for the hearing, was not pleased hearing this.\n\n\"This is sounding to me kind of like the Wild West -- very little control from Fulton County over a $36 million budget,\" he said, according to Fox News. \"You don't know how much of that is spent on professional services, who is hired, how much they're paid per hour, what their total compensation is.\"\n\n\"Yet you're being asked to provide $36.6 million a year that you know encompasses a number of those types of independent contractors that you know you're funding with no oversight or control, right?\" he added.\n\nOne of the witnesses, Fulton County Commissioner Robb Pitts, testified that Willis doesn't even need pre-approval for anything, including hiring an independent special counsel.\n\n\"And [the district attorney] doesn't have to even report back to you how the money was spent or who was hired as an independent contractor and how much they were paid?\" Cowsert asked Pitts at one point.\n\n\"We don't know what she's spends it for, because she doesn't have to answer to (commissioners),\" he later told reporters.\n\nPitts appeared to agree, judging by what he himself later told reporters.\n\n\"After we appropriate money to them, I think we have an obligation, a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpaying citizens of the county, to know how that money's being spent,\" he said after the hearing, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nWillis has for her part pushed back on the criticisms by predictably playing the race card, as usual. As a reminder, she's a rabid Democrat.\n\n\"Isn't it interesting, when we've got a bunch of African American DAs, now we need daddy to tell us what to do,\" she told reporters. \"They can look all they want. The DA's office has done everything according to the books. We are following the law.\"\n\nMeanwhile, state Sen. Harold Jones accused Republicans of holding the hearing only because they sought revenge for Willis' unprecedented lawfare against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"If Chairman Pitts had come in here without all that fanfare and said that he wanted that law changed and started talking about changing how sheriffs do business in South Georgia, talking about changing how district attorneys do business in South Georgia, they would have laughed him out of that room,\" Jones said after the hearing.\n\n\"But now, all of a sudden, because they want to get back at Fani Willis, now all of a sudden they want to actually do that,\" he added.\n\nHe also claimed he learned nothing new from the hearing.\n\n\"There's nothing else to talk about quite frankly and we found that out today,\" he said. \"That's the only thing I learned was how to become a Fulton County Commissioner. Nothing involved the state of Georgia today.

The Committee was formed after the multiple scandals that broke over Willis' relationship with her special prosecutor in the Trump election case Nathan Wade.\n\nAmong the things they have been looking into payments in regard to Nathan Wade with whom she admitted she had a relationship. The senators grilled financial officers on Friday about the use of the funds.\n\nRepublican Sen. Bill Cowsert asked financial officers about numerous \"enhancement requests\" for extra money Willis has made, including one for roughly a million dollars in 2023 for general trial expenses.\n\nFulton County Chief Financial Officer Sharon Whittmore said the amount was made as a \"lump sum, not specific with line item details,\" to explain what it would be used for, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nCowsert said he was trying to \"get a feeling for exactly how much oversight,\" there was in the office, adding it \"sounds like it's very loose as far as employment practices and expenditures for independent contractors.\"\n\nCowsert also criticized her for spending on going after former President Donald Trump, when there was a backlog of real criminal cases that she needed to address. He said they likely would be calling her.\n\n\"She's a key part of the investigation and her viewpoints are valued by us. We need to hear what she has to say and her explanation and what she thinks the appropriate rules ought to be going forward so that we don't have this kind of scandal giving Georgia a black eye in the future,\" said Cowsert.\n\nCowsert said they would subpoena her, if necessary, if she did not comply with their request.\n\nWillis did not attend the hearing but responded, claiming, \"They can look all they want. The DA's office has done everything according to the books.\"\n\n\"Isn't it interesting when we've got a bunch of African American DAs, now we need daddy to tell us what to do,\" Willis also said while in attendance at a community event on Friday.\n\nI'm just going to guess that the judge in the Trump election case is not going to be happy with that comment, since he already ripped her over the comments she'd made about race during her infamous \"church speech,\" where she made comments that raising questions about the hiring of Wade was about racism. But she just doesn't seem to be able to stop herself from continuing to step in it with her comments.\n\nWillis is also facing a probe by the House looking into her office's alleged misuse of federal grant funds after a whistleblower came forward. Willis has claimed the whistleblower is a \"disgruntled employee.\"", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_arama@redstate.com", "name": "Nick Arama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cowsert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Cowsert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/75/c24d9a14-b516-4d55-952f-d69a50b6c64f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539266", "eventUri": "eng-9539266", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Bill Cowsert, a Republican representing Athens and chairman of the committee, questioned Fulton County Commissioner Robb Pitts and Fulton County Chief Financial Officer Sharon Whittmore about how the DA's office receives and spends its funds. The witnesses testified that Willis has broad discretion over those taxpayer dollars, including whether to hire a special prosecutor and how much they should be paid.\n\n\"This is sounding to me kind of like the Wild West, very little control from Fulton County over a $36 million budget,\" Cowsert said after asking several questions about the county budget process.\n\n\"You don't know how much of that is spent on professional services, who is hired, how much they're paid per hour, what their total compensation is. Yet you're being asked to provide $36.6 million a year that you know encompasses a number of those types of independent contractors that you know you're funding with no oversight or control, right?\" he asked Whittmore at one point.\n\nANTI-TRUMP DA BAILED ON DEBATE TO 'SCHMOOZE' WITH CELEBS, IS CHALLENGED TO A REMATCH\n\n\"Yeah, the board of commissioners has no oversight over the district attorney,\" the finance chief answered.\n\nPitts testified that Willis has wide discretion over how to spend the funds appropriated for the district attorney's office and said she does not have to get any pre-approval for hiring an independent special counsel to assist with her activities.\n\n\"And [the district attorney] doesn't have to even report back to you how the money was spent or who was hired as an independent contractor and how much they were paid?\" Cowsert asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Pitts replied.\n\nANTI-TRUMP DA'S NO-SHOW AT DEBATE LEAVES CHALLENGER FACING OFF AGAINST EMPTY PODIUM\n\nThe Georgia Senate Special Committee on Investigations convened its third meeting on Friday to probe allegations of potential conflicts of interest and potential misuse of public funds by Willis, who indicted former President Trump on conspiracy charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\n\nWillis is up for re-election this year and has denied any wrongdoing. The findings of this legislative probe could inform acts by the Georgia legislature to reform laws or adjust the state appropriations process with the intention of restoring public confidence in the district attorney's office, according to FOX 5 Atlanta.\n\nGeorgia's GOP-controlled Senate voted in January to form a special committee to investigate Wilis amid revelations she had an 'improper' affair with subordinate counsel.\n\nThe special committee has subpoena power to investigate Willis over allegations she hired special prosecutor Nathan Wade for the case because of their alleged romantic relationship.\n\nAFTER JUDGE'S SCOLDING FOR PLAYING 'RACE CARD,' FANI WILLIS SAYS SHE'LL 'TALK ABOUT IT ANYWAY'\n\nIn January, Trump co-defendant Michael Roman filed court documents alleging that Willis had been having an \"improper\" affair with Wade, whom she hired to help prosecute the 2024 GOP front-runner. Roman and his lawyers argue the relationship created a conflict of interest and that she benefited financially from it in the form of lavish vacations the two took using funds his law firm received for working the case.\n\nWillis has called the allegations \"salacious\" and said they have no \"merit,\" though she admitted in a court filing that she and Wade have been \"professional associates and friends since 2019.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital's Brianna Herlihy contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

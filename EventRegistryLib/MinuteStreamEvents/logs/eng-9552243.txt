When he wasn't there, they weren't - and aren't.\n\nThomas Tuchel substituted Kane in the 85th minute against Real Madrid. At that point, Bayern were protecting a one-goal lead and were going to Wembley with the England captain having led their charge.\n\nSo while there are other factors in play - notably Manuel Neuer's error as he spilled the ball to allow Joselu his first of a dramatic late double, plus Madrid's innate ability to win big European games even when hope seems lost - the substitution has been pinpointed as the turning point.\n\nIt also encapsulates what the 2023-24 season has been for Bayern - a campaign where they have looked lost when without Kane. And now, Kane ends his debut campaign at Bayern with nothing.\n\n\"He has done his job. He has scored the goals,\" Champions League winner Rio Ferdinand told TNT Sports.\n\n\"They brought him to continue winning trophies and I feel the others have let him down more than anything. I think he will have a heavy heart tonight.\"\n\nWhile Bayern were after the seventh European Cup in their history, Kane was looking for the first major trophy of an otherwise stellar career.\n\nCertainly, this season could not have been better from an individual perspective for Kane, scoring 44 goals in all competitions - his best ever scoring season.\n\nYet while Kane has shone, this flawed Bayern side have fallen short and will end the season without a major trophy for the first time since 2011-12.\n\n\"I feel so sorry for Kane. What a superstar he has been and he doesn't have an opportunity [in a Champions League final],\" former Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves told TNT Sport.\n\n\"Poor guy. He has been amazing this season and that just didn't go to plan in the last 10 minutes.\"\n\nIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESImage caption,\n\nHarry Kane has scored 44 goals in 45 games across all competitions for Bayern this season\n\nIn that 2011-12 campaign when Bayern finished empty-handed, Kane was finishing a season on loan from Tottenham to Millwall, where he scored seven goals in 22 League One games and was still a year away from his Premier League debut.\n\nThis season, he has almost singlehandedly tried to drag Bayern to glory.\n\nBayern's second highest scorer, Jamal Musiala - also subbed off in Madrid - has just 12 goals in all competitions.\n\nHowever, hampered by poor performances and bad decisions around him, Kane has come up just short.\n\nBayern lost their 11-year grip on the Bundesliga title to Bayer Leverkusen, were knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken and now they will be stunned having seemed set for an all-German final in the Champions League.\n\nAfter a quiet opening quarter of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu, Kane sprung to life with a snap volley from the D in the 28th minute which Andriy Lunin had to go full stretch down to his left to save.\n\nBut Bayern around him were again off the pace, with a passive showing that saw Madrid dominate. Only a series of fine saves from Neuer kept the tie level, until Kane made his most telling intervention.\n\nAlphonso Davies' strike with his supposed weaker right foot to put Bayern ahead on the night caught the eye, but it was Kane who made the play by dropping deep, then spraying an idea pass out to the left for the Canadian full-back to take on, cut inside and fire home.\n\nKane's value to Bayern stretches way beyond goals. He even led the complaints to the referee when Nacho shoved Joshua Kimmich in the face before Madrid appeared to have equalised, prior to the goal being ruled out by VAR.\n\nBut then came the turning point, as with five minutes remaining Tuchel replaced Kane with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as part of a series of changes to try and see out the match.\n\n\"That will be viewed as the moment Tuchel lost this for Bayern,\" German football expert Archie Rhind-Tutt told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"You could see it in his facial expression after the second Madrid goal went in - he looked shaken. He usually has a very good poker face, Tuchel. That for me was a guy who knew it had all gone wrong.\"\n\nTuchel, due to depart at the end of the season, defended his call, saying Kane was in no state to continue.\n\n\"He couldn't keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn't keep going, his back froze up,\" Tuchel said.\n\nShortly before Kane came off, Choupo-Moting's fellow former Stoke City player Joselu was thrown on by Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti - and he snatched the striking glory.\n\nAs the Real players streaked on to the pitch to celebrate Joselu's winner, Kane was left in the away team dugout to wonder what might have been.", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF",

That's one of the biggest subs I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude,\" former Bayern player Hargreaves told TNT Sports.\n\n\"To take off a guy that's scored 44 goals, who is the most durable player pretty much anywhere and you bring on another striker in Choupo-Moting. Maybe he wanted height for corners, I don't know.\n\n\"You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's ten minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes. I said to Scholesy straight away, \"they're going to score.\"\n\n\"That's one of the biggest calls [I've seen]. I love Thomas Tuchel. I don't know why they made that call. Kim came on ten minutes before that and they were quite comfy. They went from a back four to a back three. Bayern had it in their hands and they let it go. The mistake from Neuer obviously but everybody's going to be talking about the subs, you cannot take Harry Kane off.\"\n\nScholes added: \"It ended up a game of substitutions. Good ones for Real Madrid. Joselu with the two goals, brilliant. Wins his team the game. Neuer makes a huge mistake which he'll be disappointed with.\n\n\"I thought Tuchel's substitutions were strange. Kane was strange. Even if they get one goal, there's still extra-time, penalties to come as well, you know how strong he is.\n\n\"Kim was the stranger one. I thought they looked quite comfortable in the game up until that point. They go to three at the back. Kim coming off last week was a disaster for him and again he looked a little bit all over the place.\"\n\nTuchel later defended his decision by explaining Kane was struggling with an injury and wanted to protect him.\n\n\"Kane was having back problems.

When he wasn't there, they weren't - and aren't.\n\nThomas Tuchel substituted Kane in the 85th minute against Real Madrid. At that point, Bayern were protecting a one-goal lead and were going to Wembley with the England captain having led their charge.\n\nSo while there are other factors in play - notably Manuel Neuer's error as he spilled the ball to allow Joselu his first of a dramatic late double, plus Madrid's innate ability to win big European games even when hope seems lost - the substitution has been pinpointed as the turning point.\n\nIt also encapsulates what the 2023-24 season has been for Bayern - a campaign where they have looked lost when without Kane. And now, Kane ends his debut campaign at Bayern with nothing.\n\n\"He has done his job. He has scored the goals,\" Champions League winner Rio Ferdinand told TNT Sports.\n\n\"They brought him to continue winning trophies and I feel the others have let him down more than anything. I think he will have a heavy heart tonight.\"\n\nWhile Bayern were after the seventh European Cup in their history, Kane was looking for the first major trophy of an otherwise stellar career.\n\nCertainly, this season could not have been better from an individual perspective for Kane, scoring 44 goals in all competitions - his best ever scoring season.\n\nYet while Kane has shone, this flawed Bayern side have fallen short and will end the season without a major trophy for the first time since 2011-12.\n\n\"I feel so sorry for Kane. What a superstar he has been and he doesn't have an opportunity [in a Champions League final],\" former Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves told TNT Sport.\n\n\"Poor guy. He has been amazing this season and that just didn't go to plan in the last 10 minutes.\"\n\nIn that 2011-12 campaign when Bayern finished empty-handed, Kane was finishing a season on loan from Tottenham to Millwall, where he scored seven goals in 22 League One games and was still a year away from his Premier League debut.\n\nThis season, he has almost singlehandedly tried to drag Bayern to glory.\n\nBayern's second highest scorer, Jamal Musiala - also subbed off in Madrid - has just 12 goals in all competitions.\n\nHowever, hampered by poor performances and bad decisions around him, Kane has come up just short.\n\nBayern lost their 11-year grip on the Bundesliga title to Bayer Leverkusen, were knocked out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken and now they will be stunned having seemed set for an all-German final in the Champions League.\n\nAfter a quiet opening quarter of the match at the Santiago Bernabeu, Kane sprung to life with a snap volley from the D in the 28th minute which Andriy Lunin had to go full stretch down to his left to save.\n\nBut Bayern around him were again off the pace, with a passive showing that saw Madrid dominate. Only a series of fine saves from Neuer kept the tie level, until Kane made his most telling intervention.\n\nAlphonso Davies' strike with his supposed weaker right foot to put Bayern ahead on the night caught the eye, but it was Kane who made the play by dropping deep, then spraying an idea pass out to the left for the Canadian full-back to take on, cut inside and fire home.\n\nKane's value to Bayern stretches way beyond goals. He even led the complaints to the referee when Nacho shoved Joshua Kimmich in the face before Madrid appeared to have equalised, prior to the goal being ruled out by VAR.\n\nBut then came the turning point, as with five minutes remaining Tuchel replaced Kane with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting as part of a series of changes to try and see out the match.\n\n\"That will be viewed as the moment Tuchel lost this for Bayern,\" German football expert Archie Rhind-Tutt told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"You could see it in his facial expression after the second Madrid goal went in - he looked shaken. He usually has a very good poker face, Tuchel. That for me was a guy who knew it had all gone wrong.\"\n\nTuchel, due to depart at the end of the season, defended his call, saying Kane was in no state to continue.\n\n\"He couldn't keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn't keep going, his back froze up,\" Tuchel said.\n\nShortly before Kane came off, Choupo-Moting's fellow former Stoke City player Joselu was thrown on by Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti - and he snatched the striking glory.\n\nAs the Real players streaked on to the pitch to celebrate Joselu's winner, Kane was left in the away team dugout to wonder what might have been.", "source": {"uri": "the-star.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@the-star.co.ke", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

This man is officially cursed.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"The Kane curse is so real now.. it's no longer a joke.. what will he have to do to win a trophy?? I feel bad for him.\"\n\nA fifth added: \"It's real. It's damn real.\"\n\nKane and co felt they should have had the opportunity to play extra time after Matthijs de Ligt shot the ball into the net in the 12th minute of injury time after an INCORRECT offside call that would have been overturned by VAR.\n\nHowever, since the whistle had already gone before the shot had happened, the referee could not bring the play back to allow the goal.\n\nBayern boss Thomas Tuchel - who fans joked had passed his Manchester United audition amid reports of him going to Old Trafford - lambested the call as a \"disaster\" that was \"against the rules\".\n\nDutchman De Ligt claimed in his post-match interview the linesman had apologised for \"making a mistake\"\n\nThe Dutchman told beIN Sports: \"\"This is a shame. The linesman said to me 'I'm sorry I made a mistake'.\n\n\"In the end, I'm not the type of person who wants to blame the loss or win on the referee so Madrid deserves to win because they won 2-1.\n\n\"But I think, if it's a rule, it's a rule and that's the only thing I can say about it.\"\n\nOn the upside, if Bayern Munich's last trophyless season is anything to go by, Kane could well be

Bayern's attacking threat dissipated entirely without Kane and Musiala. In fact, they had one shot after those changes - a Noussair Mazraoui effort that almost went out for a throw.\n\nTuchel said after the game that he had to replace all four of his attackers - Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sane were subbed earlier in the game - due to injuries and cramp.\n\nBut with so little time left and Bayern only holding a one-goal advantage, could Tuchel have asked Kane to tough it out for the rest of the game?\n\nEven if physically diminished, Kane has 44 goals this season and provides more of a threat than Thomas Muller and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, the forwards with a combined age of 69 that Tuchel summoned from the bench.\n\nThe England captain had provided the assist for the Alphonso Davies goal that looked set to send Bayern to Wembley - one of two chances he created on the night, more than any other Bayern player.\n\nBut it isn't just the Kane substitution that Tuchel may regret. In the 76th minute, Min-Jae Kim was brought on as Bayern switched to a five-player defence.\n\nThe defender endured a nightmare first leg, having a role in both Real goals, and was again at fault for the winner, playing Real's entire team onside as Antonio Rudiger crossed for Joselu.\n\nKane may have claimed the assist for Davies' goal but that strike owed everything to the work done by the full-back, who was playing as a winger in place of the injured Gnabry.\n\nIn fact, Kane's pass to Davies was one of only four he completed during his entire time on the pitch - comfortably the lowest number among all players who started the game.\n\nThe 30-year-old looked off the pace for much of the game, under-hitting passes to Sane and Davies in the first half that could have started dangerous counter-attacks.\n\nKane also won fewer than 50 per cent of his duels, with Antonio Rudiger and Nacho nipping in to pinch the ball on several occasions.\n\nTuchel was clearly unimpressed with the way his attackers performed, saying after the match: \"We were not clinical enough in our counter attacks - we could have scored if we were more clinical and calm.\"\n\nKane's low-key performance plays into the narrative that he fails to step up on the biggest stages. It is a fact that, across a Champions League final, European Championship final and two League Cup finals, Kane has failed to score. Indeed, Kane has lost all four of those games.\n\nMore recently, the striker missed a penalty as England were knocked out of the 2022 World Cup in the quarter-finals by France.\n\nIt's also true that, in six career games in the Champions League quarter-finals or beyond, Kane has scored twice - both of which were penalties.\n\nThis was Bayern's entire season - and Tuchel's Bavarian reign - on the line. With the Bundesliga already surrendered and the DFB Pokal long gone, the Champions League was the only trophy within Bayern's grasp.\n\nThey will now end the season empty-handed for the first time in over a decade, while their search for a head coach drags on after being turned down by Xabi Alonso, Julian Nagelsmann and Ralf Rangnick.\n\nEven those rejections are unlikely to lead to a volte-face from Tuchel, who is set to leave Bayern with questions over where his career goes next - while Kane's wait for his first professional trophy goes on.\n\nTuchel was criticised for his decision to replace Kane with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting in the 85th minute.\n\nFormer Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves called it \"the biggest sub I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude\".\n\nBut Tuchel explained: \"Harry Kane had back problems and Jamal [Musiala - also subbed off in Madrid] was just dead having had an injury in the last week.\n\n\"We started with a front four and all four has to go out with injury or cramp,\" he added to TNT Sports. \"Kane was having back problems, it was no longer possible. The front four all said they had to go. It's too much at that level.\"\n\nThe final takes place on Saturday June 1 at Wembley between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund - kick off at 8pm UK time.\n\nFollow live updates on the Sky Sports

New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nIt was Kane's 634th game for club and country. But in all that time, he is yet to win a major trophy.\n\nFootball fans often talk about a god of football. Perhaps Kane made a deal with football's devil - to become one of the most celebrated scorers of his era, yet never to win.\n\nThough he now resides in Munich, having made a MONEY move in the off-season, the endless taunts of opposition fans that have dogged the illustrious striker throughout his career must hit even closer to home.\n\nIn 435 appearances for Tottenham, Kane scored 280 times - putting him beyond even the great Jimmy Greaves as Spurs' all-time top scorer. His record included 213 strikes in the Premier League, second only to Alan Shearer's 260.\n\nHe claimed the Premier League golden boot in three separate seasons, yet the side that Ange Postecoglou now oversees is still chasing a first major trophy since the 2008 league cup.\n\nOnly once in the Kane era did they finish in the top-two in the Premier League - back in 2016/17, when Kane scored 29 times including a stunning four hat-tricks. Spurs finished with 86 goals, their most in a league campaign since 1962-63.\n\nEven that wasn't enough: Chelsea still won by seven points.\n\nThere have been other near-misses for Kane in his time at Tottenham.\n\nThe most painful, perhaps, is the 2018/19 Champions League final, when Spurs lost 2-0 to Liverpool.\n\nThere was also a 2015 League Cup final (lost 2-0 to Chelsea), another loss in the same competition in 2021 (1-0 to Manchester City).\n\nOnly a couple of months after that defeat, Kane suffered the greatest near-miss of his career: when England lost a penalty shootout to Italy in the final of the (delayed) 2020 Euros - once again on the famed turf of Wembley.\n\nHarry Kane played every single minute for Spurs and England in each of the above finals. He captained the Three Lions in the latter tournament and scored in the shootout, just as he captained them in the 2018 World Cup and won the golden boot as they reached the semi-finals.\n\nAfter all these heartbreaks, after his long years of service to his hometown team, things were supposed to be different this season.\n\nBayern had won the German Bundesliga 11 seasons in a row - and won five of the last 11 DFB Pokal (German Cup) tournaments in that time too. They also won the Champions League, the Club World Cup, and the UEFA Super Cup in both 2013 and 2020 - and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League semi-finals four other times in the period between those two titles.\n\nThe German team, put simply, were serial winners: juggernauts in the way that Tottenham can only aspire to be these days.\n\nKane has scored 36 goals (and four hat-tricks) with eight assists already in 32 league games this season, a record season for a newcomer to the Bundesliga that will all-but-assure him of winning another golden boot.\n\nHe added eight goals and four assists in 12 Champions League games - a record for an English player in terms of goal involvements in a CL campaign.\n\nAnd yet Bayern have lost the Bundesliga title, currently sitting 15 points behind Bayern Leverkusen with two games to play. Even second place isn't assured, with VfB Stuttgart looming just two points behind them.\n\nBayern were also dumped out of the German Cup - the DFB Pokal - in just the second round by third-tier Saarbr\u00fccken. They also lost the German Super Cup (played between the reigning league and cup winners) 3-0 to RB Leipzig, with Kane playing less than half an hour off the bench.\n\nAnd when Kane played a delightful pass for Alphonso Davies to score a sublime goal in the 68th minute, it seemed that a finals date with their German rivals Borussia Dortmund - and a return to Wembley for Kane - was within reach.\n\nBut it all fell apart as the nigh-inevitable Madrid juggernaut fought back, scoring twice through an unlikely source in Joselu, a 34-year-old loanee from second-division Espanyol.\n\nKane, meanwhile, was substituted in a move that left commentators floored, given he is Munich's penalty taker and a shootout was possible. Kane is also an asset in closing out games given his ability to hold up the ball and waste time, and to defend corners and crosses. His replacement was a straight swap for Eric-Maxim Chuopo-Moting - a striker who had scored just three times in 920 minutes across all competitions this season.\n\nIt wasn't the only controversial substitution. Star attackers Jamal Musiala and Leroy Sane had both been taken off already by Thomas Tuchel, with Bayern going into a defensive shell that soon backfired.\n\nBut Tuchel after the game revealed that Kane's substitution was forced, saying \"He couldn't keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn't keep going, his back froze up.\"\n\nPerhaps the curse had found a new way to strike down Kane's hopes, as the England superstar was left to watch from the sidelines as his Champions League dream faded away again.\n\nIt means that this season, for the first time in 12 years, Bayern will not win a trophy.\n\nHarry Kane left England to win trophies, joining a club that has racked up silverware with ease - and somehow came up empty despite a maiden individual campaign for the ages.\n\nKane has never scored or assisted in a final, outside of his penalty shootout goal in the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy.\n\nAnd he has struggled to make an impact in many other crucial games, while key errors have also played a part in his failure to secure a single major trophy.\n\nIn the 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia, and with England leading 1-0, Kane opted to shoot instead of passing to a wide-open Raheem Sterling. His shot was saved and Kane's follow-up hit the woodwork from just a metre or so out. England would collapse late in the match before losing in extra-time.\n\nFour years later, he had the chance to make amends in the World Cup quarter-finals in Qatar. This time it was against France. Kane scored a penalty, before having another attempt from the 12-yard dot late in the game with England a goal down. But Kane blazed it off the top of the bar, and the Three Lions were dumped out by the reigning champions.\n\nThat's not to say that Kane is to blame for his failure to win a trophy for club and country - tactics and teammates have let him down time and again. But in just over a month, Kane will captain England at the Euros in Germany - and it could be the perfect opportunity to finally end his trophy curse.\n\nThe world's fourth-ranked side enter the tournament as favourites, with Kane second-favourite to take the golden boot behind France's Kylian Mbappe. His scoring form is set to prove crucial to the Three Lions' hopes, and if he performs in big games, he could just prove the doubters wrong.\n\nHaving moved to Germany to win trophies and seen that turn into a disastrous 12-year low for Bayern Munich, it would be fitting for Kane to guide England to glory on the soil of his new home.\n\nIf he does so, he would not only end his own personal curse, but the one that has doomed his national team to repeated failures in their long wait for a first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType":

One of their own.\n\nThe numbers were staggering. But one particular statistic - and the stigma attached to it - he couldn't bare.\n\nFor Kane, it was - and is - the most crucial number of all.

He continues, frustratingly, having to settle for silver or worse.\n\nHis \u00a3120million move to Bavaria was expected to herald an instant rush of trophies to finally add what was missing from Kane's goal-laden career.\n\nBecause, traditionally, Bayern win. And win big.\n\nTottenham was all Kane ever knew before his \u00a3100m move to Bayern before leaving England in search of gold\n\nBut despite Bayern's reputation for winning big, sKane has had to settle for silver or less\n\nSo, with that in mind, you'd forgive Kane for trying to recall whether he'd broken a mirror or walked under a ladder.\n\nSecond to Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga as Bayern failed to win the domestic title for the first time in 12 years was underwhelming.\n\nTheir shock loss to third-tier Saarbrucken in the German Cup was shambolic and meant Bayern ended their domestic season without silverware for the first time since 2012.\n\nAnd then came Wednesday night; defeat from the clutches of a euphoric win that would have gained them entry into the Champions League final against fellow German side Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAll Kane could do was sit and watch from the bench as his team, leading 1-0 heading into the final two minutes of normal time, somehow contrived to throw it all away at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nThe dejected expression on Kane's face after their defeat to Real Madrid offered a haunting insight into the pain he is enduring\n\nYou'd forgive Kane for trying to recall whether he'd broken a mirror or walked under a ladder after a difficult season in Germany\n\nThomas Tuchel's decision to substitute Kane during the closing stages of the game has been pilloried, although the German coach insists his hand was forced with his star striker having suffered a back injury.\n\n'I'll tell you what was unexpected, Harry Kane going off the pitch. That's one of the biggest subs I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude,' said former England and Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves.\n\n'To take off a guy that's scored 44 goals, who is the most durable player pretty much anywhere and you bring on another striker in [Maxim] Choupo-Moting. Maybe he wanted height for corners, I don't know.\n\n'You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's ten minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes.'\n\nBut the ifs, buts and maybes are neither here nor there, certainly for Kane, whose trophyless streak continues.\n\nThe dejected expression on his face in the aftermath of Real Madrid's latest Champions League miracle offered a haunting insight into the pain he is enduring.\n\nScoring 44 goals in 45 games is extraordinary, but his trophies record continues to hound him\n\nThe numbers remain exemplary. Forty-five games, 44 goals, 12 assists. Kane's personal reputation as Europe's most complete marksman is snowballing.\n\nBut it's that big, fat zero that continues to hound him. And, until that zero is no more, it's a suffering that won't heal.\n\nOf course, the season isn't over. If Kane is looking for a silver lining following his team's last-gasp capitulation in Spain's capital then he may find it in the form of England's forthcoming tilt at glory.\n\nThe fact he won't be featuring in the Champions League final at Wembley on June 1 means he'll be able to play a full part in the preparations for Euro 2024, a tournament Gareth Southgate's side head into as favourites.\n\nThose close to Kane explain that is exactly how he'll approach the next few days.\n\nRead More Thomas Tuchel insists Harry Kane was injured and he HAD to take him off against Real Madrid - after Bayern Munich boss was slammed for subbing star striker in Champions League semi-final collapse\n\n'What's the next challenge? That's what he'll be telling himself,' said one source.\n\nNo time for self-loathing, or self-pity. That isn't how he is built. Onto the next one.\n\nKane will seek refuge in his family, as he always does. His father Ted, brother Charlie, wife Kate and four children are always on hand to console and encourage.\n\nBut, moreover, Kane may look to consider how he can impact his - and his team's - destiny. Kane can be self-critical, in many ways that is one of his strongest attributes.\n\nSo, one area he may look to is his goal return in the biggest matches. He didn't score for Spurs in his three finals for the club.\n\nHe scored twice in his eight semi-finals for the north London side, one of which was from the spot.\n\nFor England, he has scored in one of the two major tournament semi-finals he has played in - the winner against Denmark at Euro 2020, a strike that came from his original saved penalty. He didn't score in the final of the same tournament against Italy.\n\nKane did score in the Champions League semi-final first leg against Real last week, but that was a penalty.\n\nSometimes we get carried away with the 'big goals in big games' narrative; for example Thierry Henry, who has won everything, scored no goals in his nine finals as a professional.\n\nKane has only managed four goals in 18 semi-finals and finals during his career\n\nIndeed, there are other ways to impact football matches; we shouldn't forget it was Kane's pass that led to Alphonse Davies firing Bayern ahead on Wednesday night.\n\nBut his overall record of four goals in 18 semis and finals offers room for improvement.\n\nSteven Gerrard, for example, has scored in a Champions League, UEFA Cup, FA Cup and EFL Cup final.\n\nDidier Drogba has scored 10 goals in the 10 finals he has played. Some players possess an innate ability to drag their teams over the line when it's most needed.\n\n'There's always moments (of self doubt) in high pressure games, or in the lead-up to big tournaments or big moments,' said Kane in October.\n\n'I don't know if it's just doubt; it's the anticipation of what's coming and what's going to happen, how's it going to play out.'\n\nSteven Gerrard and Didier Drogba have both shown a knack of scoring when it matters\n\nKane, unquestionably, has the ability to emulate Gerrard and Drogba's contributions in high pressure situations - and there will be further opportunities to prove he is the man for the big occasion.\n\nBecause Bayern will come again, make no mistake. And so, too, will Kane.\n\n'He will have a career like Zlatan [Ibrahimovic],' someone close to Kane explained.\n\n'He will play until he's 40, travel Europe and win trophies.'\n\nIndeed, those at Bayern have been amazed at Kane's dedication to recovery after training and matches as he leaves no stone unturned in search of career longevity.\n\nAt Bayern's yearly visit to Oktoberfest, Kane barely touched the stein of beer placed in front of him, while his commitment to nutrition, particularly 48 hours prior to match days, is one of the key reasons his availability record has improved significantly from the earlier days of his career.\n\nKane leaves no stone unturned in search of career longevity and barely touched his stein of beer at Oktoberfest earlier this season\n\nAt the age 30, provided he stays free of serious injury, Kane has ample time to change the narrative that engulfs him regarding his non-existent trophy record.\n\nHe faced pressure at Tottenham, of course. But, privately, Kane acknowledges he's experiencing a different level of pressure in Bavaria. It's not pressure at Bayern, but expectation.\n\nUltimately, it was why Kane chose Bayern last summer. The guarantee of, at the very least, challenging for trophies every year was alluring, as was the opportunity to join one of European football's undisputed heavyweights.\n\nAnd for Kane, at least for the time being, his priority is to finally end his trophy duck with Bayern next season.\n\nHe has three years left on his contract and appears to have no intention of trying to seek a way out anytime soon.\n\nHaving spent the majority of the season in a luxurious five-star hotel in the heart of Munich's old town district, Kane's family have since moved into the upmarket area of Grunwald, known as the the 'Beverley Hills of Bavaria'.\n\nKane has settled in well in Munich and the arrival of close friend Eric Dier has helped him\n\nThe 30-year-old will have the chance to claim his first trophy with England at Euro 2024\n\nEric Dier's arrival at Bayern, with whom Kane has a close friendship from their time together at Tottenham and England, has also eased the settling in process for the striker.\n\nKane and Dier are becoming familiar faces at the nearby 27-hole Munchener Golf club in Strasslach and Golfplatz Schloss in Egmating as the pair perfect their swings.\n\nBut no hole in one can substitute the ultimate success Kane is relentlessly pursuing.\n\nOn that summer's evening in Bremen last August, Kane scored and assisted.\n\nHope sprung eternal then. That optimism has slowly - and rather painfully - diminished.\n\nIn a few weeks, back in his adopted home of Germany, the anticipation levels will go through the roof again.\n\nCan Kane finally break his duck? Let's hope so.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type":

This man is officially cursed.\"\n\nA fourth said: \"The Kane curse is so real now.. it's no longer a joke.. what will he have to do to win a trophy?? I feel bad for him.\"\n\nA fifth added: \"It's real. It's damn real.\"\n\nKane and co felt they should have had the opportunity to play extra time after Matthijs de Ligt shot the ball into the net in the 12th minute of injury time after an INCORRECT offside call that would have been overturned by VAR.\n\nHowever, since the whistle had already gone before the shot had happened, the referee could not bring the play back to allow the goal.\n\nBayern boss Thomas Tuchel - who fans joked had passed his Manchester United audition amid reports of him going to Old Trafford - lambested the call as a \"disaster\" that was \"against the rules\".\n\nDutchman De Ligt claimed in his post-match interview the linesman had apologised for \"making a mistake\"\n\nThe Dutchman told beIN Sports: \"\"This is a shame. The linesman said to me 'I'm sorry I made a mistake'.\n\n\"In the end, I'm not the type of person who wants to blame the loss or win on the referee so Madrid deserves to win because they won 2-1.\n\n\"But I think, if it's a rule, it's a rule and that's the only thing I can say about it.\"\n\nOn the upside, if Bayern Munich's last trophyless season is anything to go by, Kane could well be

That's one of the biggest subs I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude,\" former Bayern player Hargreaves told TNT Sports.\n\n\"To take off a guy that's scored 44 goals, who is the most durable player pretty much anywhere and you bring on another striker in Choupo-Moting. Maybe he wanted height for corners, I don't know.\n\n\"You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's ten minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes. I said to Scholesy straight away, \"they're going to score.\"\n\n\"That's one of the biggest calls [I've seen]. I love Thomas Tuchel. I don't know why they made that call. Kim came on ten minutes before that and they were quite comfy. They went from a back four to a back three. Bayern had it in their hands and they let it go. The mistake from Neuer obviously but everybody's going to be talking about the subs, you cannot take Harry Kane off.\"\n\nScholes added: \"It ended up a game of substitutions. Good ones for Real Madrid. Joselu with the two goals, brilliant. Wins his team the game. Neuer makes a huge mistake which he'll be disappointed with.\n\n\"I thought Tuchel's substitutions were strange. Kane was strange. Even if they get one goal, there's still extra-time, penalties to come as well, you know how strong he is.\n\n\"Kim was the stranger one. I thought they looked quite comfortable in the game up until that point. They go to three at the back. Kim coming off last week was a disaster for him and again he looked a little bit all over the place.\"\n\nTuchel later defended his decision by explaining Kane was struggling with an injury and wanted to protect him.\n\n\"Kane was having back problems. It was no longer possible,\" Tuchel explained.\n\n\"We started with a front four and all four had to go out with injury or cramp. The front four all said they had to go.'\n\n\"It hurts. It'll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it's a loss where we left it all out on the pitch.\n\n\"Of course, it's tough to accept. It's part of reality. No regrets.

It was a borderline call that would have required VAR to make a decision.\n\nAs a result, Kane will end his first season at the Allianz Arena without a trophy, following on from his stint with former club Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhat record did Kane set?\n\nThe only positive that the England captain could take from Wednesday night was setting an individual record for goal contributions in the competition.\n\nWith his assist for Davies's opener, Kane made it four assists for the 2023-24 tournament, adding to his eight strikes from 12 appearances.\n\nThat combined total of 12 goal contributions is the most ever by an Englishman in a single edition of the Champions League.\n\nIn total throughout his career, Kane now has 29 goals and nine assists from his 44 appearances in the Champions League, while he continues to enjoy an incredible individual campaign for Bayern.\n\nKane has chipped in with 44 strikes and 12 assists from 45 outings in all competitions. By comparison, Robert Lewandowski only enjoyed three better seasons - all between 2019 and 2022 - during his legendary stint with Bayern.\n\nBayern end the season with fixtures against Wolfsburg and Hoffenheim as they bid to finish in second place in the Bundesliga table, the current gap to Stuttgart being two points.\n\nID:543198:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4726:No Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darren_plant@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Darren Plant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewandowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Lewandowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSG_1899_Hoffenheim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TSG 1899 Hoffenheim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfsburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolfsburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wolfsburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/18/harry-kane_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552243", "eventUri": "eng-9552243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The 30 year old, who made his first-team debut on loan at Leyton Orient in England's lower leagues in 2011, has yet to win a major honour at club or international level.\n\nProlific in the Premier League - the former Spurs talisman is second in the division's all-time top scorer list with 213 - Kane has transferred that goal prowess seamlessly to the Bundesliga, banging in a staggering 44 goals in 45 matches across competitions.\n\nThirty six of those have come in only 32 league games, but Bayern's hegemony on the Bundesliga shield was broken by a Bayer Leverkusen side who have yet to taste defeat in any competition this season.\n\nThey trail by a staggering 15 points - unthinkable for a club of Bayern's stature - and even second place is far from certain, with Stuttgart looming just two points behind them with two games remaining.\n\nBayern won 11 consecutive league titles from 2013 to 2023 but will finish 2024 empty-handed. Already the dominant force domestically, the addition of Kane was supposed to expand the German club's empire into Europe, adding to their six European Cups.\n\nKane's Champions League contribution for his new team has been sizable - eight goals and four assists attest to that - and yet Bayern fell at the semi-final stage, the first time they had gone that far in Europe's premier club competition since last winning it in 2020.\n\nThe Bavarians' undoing was the concession of two late goals in Madrid. Thomas Tuchel had removed Kane, who had earlier provided a sumptuous assist for Alphonso Davies to put Bayern ahead in the tie, in the 85th minute.\n\nReal striker Joselu would score in the 88th and 91st. Kane's substitution appeared to change the momentum of the match with Bayern in control but Tuchel told broadcaster DAZN the striker was unable to continue. \"He couldn't keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn't keep going, his back froze up,\" said Tuchel.\n\nLosing in such heartbreaking fashion to a team who deal almost exclusively in heartbreak is no real shame. Far more galling is the way Bayern were dumped out of the German Cup by third-tier Saarbrucken in only the second round last November.\n\nThe cup is always low on Bayern's list of priorities, but the manner of the defeat, and the level of opposition, would only serve to highlight Bayern's shortcomings against lesser lights this season. Kane played no part in that embarrassment, and played only 30 minutes - off the bench - in Bayern's 3-0 Super Cup defeat to RB Leipzig, in his first match for the club.\n\nIt would be a huge leap to blame Kane for Bayern's woes or suggest he has upset a winning formula. The mystery of Kane making Bayern better while simultaneously weakening them is a curious one, but does overlook, rather conveniently, several factors. The indefatigability of Real Madrid and the undeniability of a Leverkusen side wildly overachieving help explain how Bayern missed out on their main objectives but the failures of those around Kane is perhaps more telling.\n\nBayern's second-highest scorer this term is Jamal Musiala with 12 while Leroy Sane was the only player to accumulate more assists than Kane's eight in the Bundesliga, highlighting the team's reliance on the England captain. Tuchel's spat with the Bayern executive branch has played out publicly all season, which has to have had some effect on the players. The German will depart imminently.\n\nZero for four trophies does not read well on any striker's CV, that's extended to eight if you take into account the finals Kane has lost playing for Tottenham and England. His critics will relish using those figures against him, but the Bayern hierarchy will have seen enough from Kane's first season to be confident their investment will pay off in the future with more titles and trophies.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_luckings@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Steve Luckings",

Alphonso Davies had sent the visitors into dreamland in the 68th minute before Carlo Ancelotti's side barely beat the clock to deliver a hammerblow.\n\nKane could only watch on from the sidelines after he was replaced in the 85th minute. The England captain was left in the dugout to excruciatingly watch as former Stoke striker Joselu scored his double, while the German giants saw Mathhijs de Ligt's effort ruled out for offside.\n\nThe \u00a386.4million transfer to the Allianz Arena from Tottenham was meant to end Kane's trophy duck. However, Real, and a Bayer Leverkusen side set to go undefeated in the Bundesliga, have conspired to ensure he does not taste club success once again.\n\nPain was etched across the striker's face as his side fell to defeat. Kane could only let his arm fall away to plant his forehead on the seat in front of him and cast his gaze to the floor. Sheer disappointment.\n\nKane could scarcely take his hands away from his head as he returned to the pitch at full-time with his teammates. The 31-year-old covered his eyes and brushed his hands through his hair in dejected disbelief.\n\nUndoubtedly, the star striker would have liked to help his team in the final moments but his boss, Thomas Tuchel expressed no regret about the decision. Speaking to DAZN he said of defeat: \"It hurts. It'll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it's a loss where we left it all out on the pitch.\n\n\"Of course, it's tough to accept. It's part of reality. No regrets. But on the other, there were too many injuries, a few too many substitutions, too many cramps.\n\n\"We started with a front four and by the end they were all off the pitch. And then Manu, who had been exceptional in saving us all night, made a mistake he wouldn't make in another 100 years.\"\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!

With the prospect of a final date looming against domestic rivals Borussia Dortmund, tensions were running high as the match approached its critical moments.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Bayern manager Thomas Tuchel made a crucial decision in the 85th minute by substituting the prolific England striker Harry Kane with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, reported by GOAL. This move came at a pivotal juncture in the game, with the possibility of extra time and penalties still on the cards. Just minutes after Kane's substitution, Real Madrid's substitute Joselu capitalized on a defensive error by Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, netting an equalizer in the 88th minute. Joselu then delivered the final blow with a 91st-minute winner, overturning Bayern's lead and sealing Real Madrid's dramatic comeback victory.\n\nThomas Tuchel's Explanation\n\nFollowing the match, Tuchel provided insight into his decision to replace Kane, citing the England international's struggle with back pain. Tuchel revealed that Kane was unable to continue due to his back issue, which had caused his back to seize up during the game.\n\nTuchel said: \"He couldn't keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn't keep going, his back froze up. We started with a front four and all four had to go out with injury or cramp. The front four all said they had to go. It hurts. It'll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it's a loss where we left it all out on the pitch. Of course, it's tough to accept. It's part of reality. No regrets. But on the other, there were too many injuries, a few too many substitutions, too many cramps.\"\n\nAdditionally, Tuchel highlighted that Kane was not the only player affected by injuries and cramps, as several members of Bayern Munchen's front four had also signaled their inability to continue. While acknowledging the disappointment of the loss, Tuchel emphasized that his team had given their all on the pitch and expressed no regrets despite the result.\n\nOwen Hargreaves disbelief\n\nThe decision to substitute a proven goalscorer like Kane in a crucial match of such magnitude raised eyebrows among experts and fans alike. Former Bayern midfielder Owen Hargreaves expressed surprise at the substitution, highlighting Kane's impressive goal-scoring record and durability. Hargreaves questioned the rationale behind Tuchel's decision, particularly given the limited time remaining in the game and the potential for extra time. Despite speculation, Tuchel's move to replace Kane with Choupo-Moting remains a subject of debate, with differing opinions on its strategic merit.\n\nOwen Hargreaves said to TNT Sports of the decision to replace Harry Kane: \"I'll tell you what was unexpected, Harry Kane going off the pitch. That's one of the biggest subs I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude. To take off a guy that's scored 44 goals, who is the most durable player pretty much anywhere and you bring on another striker in Choupo-Moting. Maybe he wanted height for corners, I don't know. You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's 10 minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes.\"\n\nHarry Kane's empty-handed season\n\nWith Bayern Munchen's Champions League dreams dashed and domestic honors out of reach, Harry Kane's debut season with the club is set to conclude without silverware. As questions arise regarding Kane's future and Tuchel's impending departure, the Allianz Arena faces a period of reflection and decision-making ahead of the summer transfer window. With significant decisions looming, Bayern's management must navigate a challenging offseason as they seek to regroup and rebuild for the future.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Maxim_Choupo-Moting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Hargreaves", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Owen Hargreaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Why-Harry-Kane-was-subbed-in-Bayern-Munchen-vs-Real-Madrid-in-the-Champions-League.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552243", "eventUri": "eng-9552243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Have your say below.\n\nThese runners-up medals are all he won with Tottenham, despite finishing as the club's all-time top scorer on 280 goals ahead of Jimmy Greaves.\n\nHis curse followed him to England and the Three Lions lost the Euro 2020 Final on penalties to Italy at Wembley, when they were the better team and should have won.\n\nHaving scored a record 62 goals for England, Kane deserves more.\n\nNow Bayern have been struck down and he appeared certain to win his first trophy when he joined the Bundesliga giants last summer.\n\nInstead they will finish empty handed for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nOf course, Kane's curse should not detract from his achievements and Alan Shearer, the Premier League's greatest striker, won just one title.\n\nGary Lineker won just one FA Cup with Tottenham in England, although he did lift the Spanish Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup with Barcelona.\n\nSir Stanley Matthews, arguably England's finest player, won the solitary FA Cup.\n\nIf he's not England's greatest, then Sir Tom Finney is and he won no major honours in his career with Preston and the Three Lions.\n\nNo-one thinks any less of these great talents because they did not win more in their careers and the same applies to Kane.\n\nHe is already Tottenham and England's greatest goalscorer, no matter what else happens, and his place in the pantheon of legends is secure.\n\nAnyway, Bayern will reboot under Thomas Tuchel's successor and no doubt Kane will be hosting aloft a piece of silverware before his contact with them ends in 2027.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

It was no longer possible,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports.\n\n\"We started with a front four and all four had to go out with injury or cramp. The front four all said they had to go.\"\n\n\"It hurts. It'll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it's a loss where we left it all out on the pitch.\n\n\"Of course, it's tough to accept. It's part of reality. No regrets. But on the other, there were too many injuries, a few too many substitutions, too many cramps.\"\n\nLeft to dissect the decision made by the former Chelsea boss in the aftermath, Owen Hargreaves couldn't believe that with just a few minutes to go in a tightly-contested affair, Kane was the player chosen to be sacrificed.\n\n\"I'll tell you what was unexpected, Harry Kane going off the pitch. That's one of the biggest subs I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude,\" he said.\n\n\"To take off a guy that's scored 44 goals, who is the most durable player pretty much anywhere and you bring on another striker in Choupo-Moting. Maybe he wanted height for corners, I don't know.\n\n\"You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's ten minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes. I said to Scholesy straight away, they're going to score.\"\n\nFormer Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes also agreed with the opinions of Hargreaves, admitting he was left confused at the tactics deployed by Tuchel.\n\n\"I thought Tuchel's substitutions were strange. Kane was strange. Even if they get one goal, there's still extra-time, and penalties to come as well, you know how strong he is.\n\n\"Kim was the stranger one. I thought they looked quite comfortable in the game up until that point. They go to three at the back.

For the hundreds of hours he has spent on a pitch, it is hard to recall much overt Kane despair beyond the occasional bout of staring into the mid-distance. Yet as the Real Madrid comeback unfolded on the pitch he slumped, pressed his forehead dolefully into the seat in front of him and could no longer watch.\n\nAt 30, of course, and still without a trophy his tale is one of the compelling stories of football. How the great English goalscorer of his generation ended up with nothing by this stage of his career is a remarkable outcome. He will doubtless win something domestically eventually at a dysfunctional Bayern, still without a manager for next season, yet - even so.\n\nHe has been the star of a Tottenham side that was the best at the club in two decades. The star of an England side that was the best the country had known in at least thirty years. Now he is the leading light in a Bayern team that has given up a dominant position in Germany for the first time in 12 years. Which all goes to show that the art of trophy winning can be hard to decipher.\n\nOn all occasions the margins were fine. Real are on the brink of six Champions League titles in 11 years in a Uefa competition the club still seeks to dismantle. They have not always been the best team in every edition they have won, but these things can gather a strange momentum.\n\nKane's goalscoring has been monumental. He has developed into the dominant all-round striker that the English game has rarely produced. His eight goals and four assists in the Champions League this season once again mark him out as one of the giants of the European game. That there is not even a League Cup to show for it is indicative more of the perils of career planning than any reflection of his capabilities.\n\nThe six-year contract that Kane signed, aged 24, at Spurs before the World Cup finals in the summer of 2018 made the player a very wealthy young man and handed the club all the power. One trophy at Spurs might have been worth five to Kane elsewhere. Also, that one of the clubs outside the wealthiest Premier League elite could hold onto a player of his standing was great for the competition. But was it great for Kane?\n\nThat his career development was slower than many others in the elite meant that his first big contract was signed later in the usual career arc of a leading player. Had he signed it in 2016, then the dynamics would have been different, but all that is gone now.\n\nWhat remains is the lesson of how ruthless leading players must be in the brief flourishing they have at the elite level. Kane knew in 2018 that he was to be less than a month from his 31st birthday when that contract was due to expire - at the end of June this year. He will also have known how stubborn Daniel Levy was likely to be. His move to Bayern last summer with one year left on the 2018 Spurs deal was by no means a bad option, but Kane's situation did not afford him all the options. He was never going to be sold to a Premier League rival.\n\nThe Real defeat fell on the fifth anniversary of Spurs' historic Amsterdam comeback in a Champions League semi-final, when Lucas Moura's hat-trick saw them through against Ajax. That night Kane was in the midst of a rare prolonged injury absence. An ankle issue meant he had not played since April 9 and would not do so again until the final against Liverpool on June 1. Even that felt like a risk on the night and so it proved. Moura was dropped by then Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino and Kane was not Kane.\n\nAgainst Real, Thomas Tuchel said he had no option in the closing stages but to substitute Kane, who was suffering from back problems. Once again, the poker-face of Kane never suggested an issue. One can only assume that it must have been bad. Kane is a master of winding down a game - from defending corners, to winning cheap free-kicks that chip away at the time.\n\nThe Bundesliga's new leading goalscorer has some weeks of rest now before he leads England in Germany at the Euros.

He was minutes away from reaching the Champions League final where he would face Jadon Sancho's Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBut that's when disaster struck!\n\nTuchel, who will leave Bayern at the end of the season after losing out on the title to Bayer Leverkusen, decided to take off one of the best strikers in the world, alongside, Jamal Musiala in the 84th minute.\n\nMadrid fed off that, pushed forward with more fire and proceeded to score two late goals from ex-Stoke City man, Joselu, to send them to Wembley.\n\nAfter the game, Thierry Henry was left fuming by Tuchel's call to substitute Kane by adding that 'you aren't playing against any Micky Mouse team. This is Real Madrid', as he told CBS Sports on Paramount+ (08/05/24 at 10:05 pm).\n\nYes, many will be talking about that Kane sub, but Manuel Neuer made the mistake of all mistakes to allow the Spanish giants back into the game and he wasn't helped by Eric Dier, either.\n\n\"The game is 90 minutes and with Real Madrid, it's really 90 minutes,\" said Henry.\n\n\"You don't take Kane out in a game like that, because you are playing against Real Madrid. You aren't playing against any Micky Mouse team. This is Real Madrid. We talked about it. I am not going to repeat what I said at the beginning of the show. It's what they do. Period. There is no luck in that. It's called Real Madrid. Period.\n\nJamie Carragher added: \"I think you look at Kane's substitution. In a normal 90-minute game, I can understand the manager making late substitutions late in the game. Every manager does it. It's easy to say when it doesn't go your way, he got it wrong. I think there is something about when a game can go to extra-time. Now, this game didn't go to extra time, my point is, if Madrid scored a late one and it goes to extra time, then you have half-hour without maybe the best striker in world football or certainly in the top two.\"\n\nThis isn't a case of whether or not he should have left Tottenham. He was right to do so. He wasn't going to win anything major at Hotspur Way.\n\nKane's issue is that he didn't leave sooner. Now, he will eventually win a trophy.

Thomas Tuchel's men lost 2-1 (4-3 aggregate) at the Santiago Bernabeu in a controversial clash last night (May 8).\n\nBayern will end the season trophyless for the first time since 2012. The Bavarians surrendered their stranglehold of the Bundesliga title to unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen. They were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal by minnows Saarbrucken FC in the second round.\n\nHarry Kane and Eric Dier arrived at the Allianz Arena this season but look to have brought the Spurs curse with them. Neither won any trophies with the Lilywhites and they won't pick up silverware with their new club this season.\n\nO'Hara could only laugh at Bayern's trophyless campaign and joked that Tottenham had infiltrated the Bundesliga giants. The former Spurs midfielder told Grosvenor Sport:\n\n\"Spurs have infiltrated Bayern Munich. It's the most Spursy thing I think I've ever seen. Out of all the years I've ever watched Bayern Munich, them winning trophies, them dominating in Germany, them (enjoying) a trophy-laden season every season.\"\n\nThe English pundit alluded to Kane's \u20ac95 million arrival last summer and Dier reuniting with him in January:\n\n\"Harry Kane and Eric Dier turn up and they don't win a trophy! How Spurs can you get? It's the most Spurs thing I've ever seen in my life. It's unbelievable. Spurs must sit there and think 'God, how's that happened?'\"\n\nKane has shone since joining Bayern Munich, registering 44 goals and 12 assists in 45 games across competitions. Many felt a move to the Allianz Arena almost certainly guaranteed him trophy success.\n\nHowever, the England captain kickstarted his Bavarian career with a 3-0 loss to RB Leipzig in the German Super Cup. That was the start of his side's failure to win a trophy this season.\n\nBayern Munich star Harry Kane reportedly nearly joined Real Madrid from Tottenham\n\nKane was one of Europe's most-wanted strikers last summer despite Tottenham showing eagerness to keep hold of him. The Lilywhites' all-time top scorer was heavily linked with Manchester United before joining Bayern Munich. Real Madrid also showed an interest after Karim Benzema opted to leave the Bernabeu.\n\nRelevo (via 90min) reports that Los Blancos decided not to sign Kane because it interfered with their pursuit of Kylian Mbappe. Carlo Ancelotti wanted the English superstar to replace Benzema but Madrid president Florentino Perez turned down his request.\n\nMbappe is set to join Real Madrid this summer once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires. Ancelotti's side have fared well without a blockbuster No.9 as Jude Bellingham has stepped up to the plate in a No.10 role.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The rewards for his strikes.\n\nRonaldo has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League.

In other news, he's not a terrible footballer.\n\nHarry Kane: Not rubbish shock\n\nHarry Kane has never won a damned thing. You might have heard. But the Telegraph's Sam Wallace has an entirely new take on this phenomenon:\n\nHarry Kane's trophy curse is a compelling football tale but no reflection of his talent\n\nOh. And there we were thinking that Harry Kane has not won anything because he is absolutely sh*te. Thanks Sam Wallace.\n\nHe does actually make some fine points about how Kane hamstrung himself with the contract he signed with Tottenham in 2018, writing:\n\nThe six-year contract that Kane signed, aged 24, at Spurs before the World Cup finals in the summer of 2018 made the player a very wealthy young man and handed the club all the power.\n\nWhich is odd because Mediawatch is old enough to remember (and competent enough to Google) when Wallace wrote in the summer of 2021 that Kane's desire to leave Tottenham 'leaves Daniel Levy exposed'.\n\nWallace then described Levy as 'vulnerable' and sniffily wrote that 'there will be those who roll their eyes and tell you that Levy will not be forced to do anything'. We did roll our eyes. We did say that Levy will not be forced to do anything. And it turns out that Levy could not be forced to do anything.\n\nThree years later, Wallace admits that Tottenham were actually handed 'all the power' and writes that 'what remains is the lesson of how ruthless leading players must be in the brief flourishing they have at the elite level'.\n\n'Ruthless'? What an odd choice of word. Had Kane turned down a long-term contract with massive wages at a club he loved, would we really have called him 'ruthless'? Or a bit daft?\n\nGreat expectations\n\nWith Harry Kane trending, it's time to roll out some absolute nonsense about Harry Kane. And if you want nonsense, you should look no further than the Express:\n\nMan Utd did something Harry Kane didn't expect in transfer talks before Bayern disaster\n\nFirst things first, there were no 'transfer talks', which feels pretty important if you're going to claim that Man Utd 'did something Harry Kane didn't expect in transfer talks'.\n\nAs The Athletic told us in September: 'Despite all the anticipation over Kane in April and May, there were never any real talks between people at United and Tottenham, or with the player's representatives, led by his brother Charlie.'\n\nBasically, Manchester United decided that spending over \u00a3100m on a 30-year-old who wanted \u00a3500,000 a week in wages was not sensible. So the deal was over way before it began.\n\nBut let's not allow that to get in the way of attempts to get 'Man Utd' and 'Harry Kane' into the same headline just after Kane has failed to win the Champions League...\n\nManchester United entered the 2023 summer transfer window with Harry Kane as Erik ten Hag's priority transfer target in search of building on a successful first season. The stars aligned as he entered the final 12 months of his Tottenham Hotspur contract, and a move to Old Trafford looked on the cards.\n\nNope.\n\nSo how did United somehow surprise Kane in these imaginary 'transfer talks'?\n\nIn recent years, the \u00a380m deal for Harry Maguire, \u00a386m for Antony and \u00a370m for Casemiro helped form the club's previous regime's reputation for mediocre negotiation skills.\n\nYou couldn't blame Kane - who was reportedly open to joining - for expecting United to do the same for him.\n\nMediawatch has read those two paragraphs several times now and yes, it does seem like Kane would have been 'expecting' Manchester United to showcase their 'mediocre negotiation skills' and spend a ludicrous sum on him. So the thing he didn't expect was their competence.

Alphonso Davies had catapulted the visitors into euphoria in the 68th minute before Carlo Ancelotti's men narrowly beat the clock to deliver a devastating blow.\n\nKane was forced to observe from the sidelines after being substituted in the 85th minute. The England skipper could only watch in agony from the dugout as ex-Stoke forward Joselu netted his brace, while the German titans saw Matthijs de Ligt's attempt disallowed for offside.\n\nThe \u00a386.4million switch to the Allianz Arena from Tottenham was supposed to break Kane's trophy drought. However, Real Madrid and a Bayer Leverkusen team on track to go unbeaten in the Bundesliga have joined forces to ensure he remains without club success.\n\nThe striker's face was a picture of despair as his team succumbed to defeat. Kane could do nothing but let his arm drop, rest his forehead on the seat in front of him and lower his gaze to the ground, reports the Mirror.\n\nDespite Kane's evident desire to influence the game's dying moments, Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel stood by his choices post-match. In his DAZN interview, Tuchel reflected on the loss: \"It hurts. It'll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it's a loss where we left it all out on the pitch.\n\nREAD MORE: Luka Vuskovic's latest goal shows why he is Ange Postecoglou's dream Tottenham defender\n\nREAD MORE: Devine and Phillips transfer interest, more Ndombele woe and Veliz boost - Tottenham loan latest\n\n\"Of course, it's tough to accept.

It was starting to feel what it must be like to play themselves. And yet, of course, even they came through that. Bayern Munich had subjected the Spanish champions to the sort of experience Real Madrid have done to so many. They dug in, they frustrated, they scored a crucial goal out of nothing amid favourable refereeing decisions. Real Madrid then threw it all in, including a supposed stand-in. For someone that was supposed to be a mere stop-gap for Kylian Mbappe, Joselu is instead a new folk hero. He scored in the 88th and 92nd minutes to somehow turn the most typical 1-0 defeat into a victory that was atypical for a team that wins more than any other.\n\nThey will now surely be eyeing up a club 15th and a personal fifth for Carlo Ancelotti. Borussia Dortmund are going to have to come up with something more than Bayern Munich, but Thomas Tuchel had seemed to get it right. This was the oddity of the game. Even his most bizarre decisions, such as taking off Harry Kane and Jamal Musiala at 1-0 up, didn't really matter because Madrid rendered it irrelevant. Although these teams have played each other so often, and offer up so many trappings of European football we're so familiar with, there was something very different about this game.\n\nReal Madrid took the initiative in a way you don't usually see in Europe. They were setting up so many chances, but also setting up a narrative - just not the one anyone was familiar with. It was almost straight away. Vinicius was just boring so many holes through the Bayern Munich defence. That created the space for Rodrygo to cause constant danger. There, however, Neuer was imperious. Although Madrid had tried to game Bayern with a throwin, catching out so many of their players with a throw further up the pitch when they thought the ball was in play, the goalkeeper was one player who was supremely alert. Neuer got the crucial touch to Vinicius Junior's low drive to put it onto the post, and then immediately got up to block Rodrygo's shot. There was so much more of that, as Madrid just kept coming.\n\nNeuer was supreme -- but not impregnable. As Madrid themselves know better than anyone, you can't miss that many chances in a major Champions League game without gradually creating more and more risk. There had been danger from Bayern, too. Kane had almost put Leroy Sane and Serge Gnabry through on a few occasions. That threat was always there, but they couldn't quite get the timing right. One threaded Kane ball required a thundering run back from Nacho. It seemed like Bayern had denied that crucial outlet when Gnabry had to go off injured. Alphonso Davies came on, a supreme player of course, but one who is usually much more forceful running from far deeper back.\n\nBayern were being pushed back that far. The big Rodrygo chance seemed the most extreme. It wasn't quite that a goal was coming, though, but more that something was about to happen. Kane this time had the opening. He played a superb lofted pass for Davies to run onto. The Canadian still had so much to do, with Antonio Rudiger in front of him. He did it spectacularly. Davies just strode forward and then stepped to the side, before swerving a soaring shot into the far corner. Bayern erupted. It seemed to finally be going wrong for Real Madrid in this competition. It was only the prelude to something greater, something even more improbable. As the match ticked into the 88th minute, a ball was struck at Neuer. It's usually the sort of effort he easily collects, but there always seems a risk to how he gathers the ball. Neuer this time spilled it like another German goalkeeper in Oliver Kahn in the 2002 World Cup final. There was Joselu, rather than Ronaldo.\n\nReal Madrid may now celebrate him like the great Brazilian. He may go one further and win a Champions League. He won this game. On 92 minutes, as Rudiger turned the ball over, Joselu turned it in. Madrid had somehow done it again, in a way not even they had managed before.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Gnabry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serge Gnabry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Kahn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Kahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_San\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leroy San\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-109989519,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-86756,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552243", "eventUri": "eng-9552243", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The forward performed well over the two legs of the European semi-final, but his record in big games in disappointing for the most part. Kane's next chance for a trophy comes with England in Euro 2024, where he aims to lead his nation to glory.\n\nHarry Kane suffered further heartache as the Bayern Munich and England star will go another club season without lifting a major trophy. The German side were knocked out of the 2023/24 Champions League in dramatic fashion by Real Madrid, with two goals from Joselu sealing the Spaniards' place in yet another European final.\n\nThe tie was level heading into the clash at the Bernabeu after an entertaining 2-2 draw was played out between the two European giants in the first leg. This meant Thomas Tuchel's men travelled to Spain at a slight disadvantage after being held to a draw at their own ground.\n\nKane perhaps thought his fortunes were going to change as Alphonso Davies opened the scoring against the run of play as the substitute, who replaced an injured Serge Gnabry, was allowed the freedom of the left flank. The full-back then cut inside onto his weaker right foot before smashing a wonderful effort into the far corner, past a helpless Andriy Lunin in the Madrid goal.\n\nRelated Ranking the 16 Greatest British Players to Ever Play Abroad Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane and Gareth Bale are three British stars who have shone for foreign clubs.\n\nHowever, Los Blancos had other ideas as the Spanish giants used their uncanny comeback powers to turn the game on its head through a Joselu brace. Kane was seen looking distraught on the bench as his side saw their hopes of lifting silverware diminish. View the video below:\n\nHarry Kane's Record in Big Games The striker has never scored in a cup final\n\nDespite his team's elimination from the competition, the English superstar actually put in a very strong showing across the two legs of the tie. Kane netted from the penalty spot when Real Madrid visited the Allianz Arena to put his side in the ascendancy before setting up Davies' strike at the Bernabeu. Individually, there's no shame in the display the 30-year-old put on, but his wait to win a trophy goes on nonetheless.\n\nIt hasn't always been the case that the ex-Tottenham forward showed up for the big occasion, however, as his record in semi-finals and finals has been rather disappointing. Kane has failed to find the back of the net in any of the finals he's taken part in, including the Champions League final with Spurs in 2019. Granted, the striker was rushed back to action after an injury issue to get on the pitch against Liverpool, but his performances in the Euro 2020 final and two separate League Cup finals weren't much better.\n\nRelated 15 Best Players in Football History Never to Have Won a Trophy Harry Kane, Socrates, Matt Le Tissier and Antonio Di Natale are among the big names that never lifted silverware during their playing careers.\n\nHis pass to Davies against Real Madrid was just the second assist he has registered in these big games. His first came in a domestic cup semi-final against Sheffield United. The elite marksman scored at Wembley Stadium in an international semi-final as he scored in extra-time against Denmark to send his country to the final of Euro 2020.\n\nTwo domestic cup semi-final strikes - both against Chelsea - round off his rather short list of goal contributions in some of the higher stakes matches. It's important to stress that other massive occasions, such as north London derbies against Arsenal, often got the best out of Kane during his Premier League days. However, whenever he gets close to breaking his trophyless run, the pressure seems to get a bit too much.\n\nHarry Kane's Big Game Record\n\nCompetition\n\nRound\n\nOpponent\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nLeague Cup\n\nSemi-Final (First Leg)\n\nSheffield United\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLeague Cup\n\nSemi-Final (Second leg)\n\nSheffield United\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLeague Cup\n\nFinal\n\nChelsea\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFA Cup\n\nSemi-Final\n\nChelsea\n\n1\n\n0\n\nFA Cup\n\nSemi-Final\n\nManchester United\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSemi-Final\n\nCroatia\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLeague Cup\n\nSemi-Final (First Leg)\n\nChelsea\n\n1\n\n0\n\nChampions League\n\nFinal\n\nLiverpool\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLeague Cup\n\nSemi-Final\n\nBrentford\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLeague Cup\n\nFinal\n\nManchester City\n\n0\n\n0\n\nEuro 2020\n\nSemi-Final\n\nDenmark\n\n1\n\n0\n\nEuro 2020\n\nFinal\n\nItaly\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLeague Cup\n\nSemi-Final (First Leg)\n\nChelsea\n\n0\n\n0\n\nLeague Cup\n\nSemi-Final (Second Leg)\n\nChelsea\n\n0\n\n0\n\nChampions League\n\nSemi-Final (First Leg)\n\nReal Madrid\n\n1\n\n0\n\nChampions League\n\nSemi-Final (Second Leg)\n\nReal Madrid\n\n0\n\n1\n\nHarry Kane's Next Chance of Winning a Trophy There's still hope for the 2023/24 season\n\nWhile he definitely won't be lifting any trophies in his debut campaign for his new club, Kane still hopes to pick up one of the biggest prizes on offer in the summer of 2024. The Three Lions ace will pull on the white shirt of England during the Euro 2024 tournament in Germany.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Harry Kane is England's all-time top goalscorer with 62 goals, overtaking Wayne Rooney's tally in March 2023.\n\nThe nation's all-time top goalscorer is one of the most vital parts of Gareth Southgate's line-up as he's the man tasked with doing the most difficult part of the game, scoring goals. Should he lead the line as well as he previously has done, England will have a great chance of winning their first major honour since the 1966 World Cup. It would be a special occasion for the Tottenham legend, who will be looking to perform closer to the levels of the Champions League semi-final towards the business end of the competition.\n\nRelated

Bayern's dominance of German football had been unprecedented, while they could also boast of two Champions League crowns in the same period, and signing the No.1 all-around striker in Europe was a real power move.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that Kane has proved himself since then. In fact, he's arguably enjoyed the best season abroad of any English player in history, scoring a staggering 44 goals in 45 appearances across all competitions. And yet, his long wait for a first career trophy goes on. Despite his individual exploits, the wheels have fallen off Bayern's winning machine, and after a narrow Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid, their 2023-24 campaign is in ruins.\n\nThose that believe in the 'Kane curse', and over-exaggerate his struggles in the biggest matches will be quick to label him a failure again.

It's an achievement.\n\nHarry Kane\n\nIt is underappreciated just how phenomenally difficult an achievement it is to be quite so consistently brilliant for a decade towards the elite level of the club and international game, without ever winning so much as a single team trophy to accompany those myriad individual awards.\n\nSome of the competitions and tournaments which disqualified otherwise legitimate candidates for this list include the Intertoto Cup (Giuseppe Signori), the Brazilian state championships Socrates won with Corinthians and Flamengo, and even the Asian Games gold medal Heung-min Son claimed as one of South Korea's over-aged players in 2018.\n\nKane dreams of following in the footsteps of Laurent Robert and lifting the Confederations Cup, of matching Antonio Di Natale with a Serie B title. But 340 goals for his six clubs and 62 for his country have been converted only into a whole load of the wrong kind of silver.\n\nMORE ON HARRY KANE'S HEARTBREAK FROM F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Harry Kane is just not 'trustworthy' with 'real stakes'; is it the Spurs curse?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 A step-by-step guide to show Harry Kane has actually scored precisely zero proper goals for England\n\nHe has been runner-up in the Champions League, the European Championships, the Premier League and the League Cup (twice), a two-time FA Cup semi-finalist, and even lost in the 2013 Championship play-offs with Leicester.\n\nTottenham's all-time record scorer has not been present for any of their 26 trophies, winning three Premier League Golden Boots but never coming within six points of first place. England's all-time record scorer won a World Cup Golden Boot and scored in a Euros final penalty shoot-out, but has been unable to remedy those years of hurt.\n\nThe move to Bayern Munich seemed like a blatant yet understandable attempt to break the curse. But it only became stronger: records have been shattered in a 44-goal season, which will simultaneously be Bayern's first without any silverware since 2011/12.\n\n\"It's hard to put a number on how many trophies you want to win,\" Kane said at the start of this season. It's far easier to put a number on how many he has won.\n\nBernd Schneider\n\nThe chief culprits for this latest chapter of Kane heartbreak are Bayer Leverkusen. The Champions League hammer blow was dealt by Real Madrid, a Stoke reject and his own manager, but the breaking of a domestic stranglehold has been most surprising.\n\nLeverkusen stand on the brink of a historic achievement: an unbeaten Treble. Five games remain of their ludicrous campaign, with two in a Bundesliga they won some time ago, a DFB-Pokal final against second division Kaiserslautern, and the Europa League, in which they lead their semi-final 2-0.\n\nSchneider walked so Xabi Alonso and his players could run.\n\nA member of the infamous 2001/02 Neverkusen side which imploded down the home straight, no outfielder played more games than Schneider that season as they squandered a five-point Bundesliga lead with three games remaining, lost the German Cup final to Schalke and were beaten at the last European hurdle by Real Madrid.\n\nIt was Schneider's cross which set up Lucio's equaliser in one of the better Champions League finals, but his nine goals and 16 assists that campaign were for nought.\n\n'The White Brazilian', nicknamed as such for his dribbling and passing ability, then spent a fruitful summer with Germany which ultimately ended in disappointing defeat to the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in the World Cup final.\n\nSchneider was also a key part of the 1999/2000 Leverkusen side which lost to Unterhaching on the final day when a draw would have been sufficient to win the Bundesliga, before finishing third with Germany at both the 2005 Confederations Cup and 2006 World Cup.\n\nThe last squad he made before retirement due to injury was the 2009 DFB-Pokal final against Wolfsburg. No points for guessing who won.\n\nYildiray Basturk\n\nAnother cog in Klaus Toppmoller's bottling machine, Basturk missed just five games in that Leverkusen season and assisted goals against Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United in Europe.\n\n\"Even Sir Alex Ferguson singled me out after the game,\" the winger later said after a man-of-the-match performance at Old Trafford.\n\nBut the return for such brilliance was scant, and Basturk could point to similarly immediate anguish at the World Cup. His Turkey side fell to Ronaldo and Brazil in the semi-finals before claiming a bronze medal with victory over co-hosts South Korea.\n\nIt added up to a ninth-place finish in the 2002 Ballon d'Or, nestled between Rivaldo and Alessandro Del Piero, for a player whose last career appearance came under Sam Allardyce at Blackburn. They did not win anything - although they did score four goals in a losing League Cup semi-final effort, shortly before Basturk signed.\n\nJulen Guerrero\n\nA legend of the one-club man genre, Guerrero broke emerged at Bilbao and never left. The 1993 La Liga Breakthrough Player of the Year became outright Spanish Player of the Year 12 months later but he could not take Athletic any higher than second, nine points off Barcelona, in 1998.\n\nGuerrero represented Spain at his second World Cup that year, having made his international debut as a teenager. He scored two hat-tricks for the national team but suffered for their major tournament struggles which would not be overcome until after he retired in 2006.\n\nReal Madrid, Barca, Atletico Madrid, Juventus, Lazio and Manchester United were interested in signing Guerrero but the attacking midfielder committed himself to a ten-year contract at San Mames which would unsurprisingly be his last.\n\nThere was a stark and sudden decline from 2002 onwards but Guerrero had been a considerable force over the previous decade. As the inimitable Sid Lowe once wrote: 'This boy was the la leche, the milk, the business.'\n\nA free-kick specialist and club captain by the age of 21, Guerrero remains a beloved Athletic figure who nevertheless reached a couple of Copa del Rey semi-finals and appeared in neither.\n\nMatt Le Tissier\n\nBasically, jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams plus government-controlled weather, multiplied by 5G masts and NHS actors equals a 1992 Zenith Data Systems Cup final, some laughably brilliant goals, an entirely wasted reputation as an adored former player and zero trophies.\n\nFor Le Tissier, it was simple. Southampton gave him what perhaps no other club could. Le God was worshipped and accommodated in a style befitting the moniker.\n\n\"I put personal happiness above money and trophies and I enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond,\" is one of the many post-retirement explanations Le Tissier has given for staying at the Dell, whether the MSM accept that or not. Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs were known to have sniffed around at various points with other clubs linked, perhaps none of whom would have embraced his penchant for sausage and egg McMuffins quite so readily.\n\nLe Tissier traded in his excellence to instead help prolong Southampton's lengthiest spell in the top flight, during which they reached one League Cup semi-final and lost that Full Members' Cup final in extra-time to Nottingham Forest, having inspired a comeback with the first goal from 2-0 down in normal time.\n\nSaints made the FA Cup final the season after he retired. They could have at least tried to hide the conspiracy.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_stead@football365.com", "name":

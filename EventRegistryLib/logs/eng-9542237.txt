For some families, it still may not be enough.", "body": "Mindy Bowman started online classes to get her psychology degree because she feels it will make her a better mom. To meet that goal, she sends her 2-year-old daughter to day care three days a week, which costs $474 a month.\n\nThat's after the child care scholarship Bowman receives as a single parent going to school full time, getting ready to start an internship and raising two other children.\n\n\"It's almost like you're paying rent for your child to go to school,\" Bowman said. \"For a long time, I didn't do it because I wanted to stay home with my kids; it was cheaper and I enjoy that. But then I wanted to go back to school. And now I'm realizing, wait, but I really can't afford it because it's so expensive.\"\n\nBowman's child care scholarship is part of the \"largest public investment in child care\" the state makes, said Laura Weeldreyer, executive director of the Maryland Family Network, a nonprofit that connects families with child care.\n\nAccording to the Maryland State Department of Education, as of mid-March more than 22,000 families were receiving financial assistance to pay for care for nearly 33,000 kids.\n\nEnrollment in the scholarship program is on the rise as care options aimed at low-income families shutter. Even as the state invests record numbers of people in the program, the model of private child care is still fundamentally broken, experts and advocates say. Child care is becoming less affordable while providers still don't make enough money. And the high costs may be keeping some Maryland mothers from returning to work, potentially causing ripple effects throughout the economy.\n\n\"The private provision of child care is a market failure. It's simply not profitable to care for children under 5,\" Kathryn Anne Edwards, a labor economist and policy researcher, said.\n\nThe Maryland General Assembly in April passed a $63 billion budget that allocates $328.5 million for the child care scholarship program, more than five times 2024's original amount. The budget also sets aside $218 million in emergency funding for the current fiscal year to cover shortfalls.\n\nAccording to reviews of state budgets going back to 2007, the first year a line item for the child care scholarship appeared in the budget, 2025's funding is the largest in the state's history by a wide margin.\n\nThe child care scholarship program, formerly known as the child care subsidy, \"helps eligible families in Maryland pay for high-quality child care and early education programs.\" According to income guidelines, a family of four making up to $90,000 and applying for the first time would be eligible if factors such as working or going to school were met. Parents may still be responsible for some of the cost, as Bowman is.\n\nBut not everyone in need qualifies, leaving some to rely on less formal methods, like family members and neighbors, to watch their children. That leads to a system that is \"incredibly unequal in quality,\" Edwards said.\n\n\"The richest who command market power can afford and demand the highest quality care. The low-income who are lucky enough to get a voucher can get high-quality care as well,\" Edwards said. \"But after that, it's just a real erosion of quality.\"\n\nPlus, Edwards said, continuing to invest in programs like child care scholarships \"keeps the power in the hands of the market,\" where the cost of child care has risen faster than the price of prescription drugs.\n\nStill, some things have become more accessible, said Del. Jared Solomon, a Democrat representing Montgomery County. Starting in 2018, legislators pushed for increased and presumptive eligibility for the scholarship program alongside more money for providers. Participation rates have risen ever since.\n\n\"In terms of the income eligibility, it used to tap out at $30,000 or $40,000 for a family of four, which obviously in most parts of Maryland is a drop in the bucket,\" Solomon said. \"[We] went from being one of the worst [states] in recent years to being one of the best.\"\n\nWeeldreyer said there are two primary forms of child care: center-based care and home-based care, often called family child care. The latter is smaller, allowing up to eight children in a home at a time; centers, meanwhile, can be as large as schools.\n\nFamily child care can often be the more accessible option for lower-income families and those living in rural areas, Weeldreyer said, making them \"an incredibly important piece of this landscape.\"\n\n\"Rural geography does not have a critical mass of population to stand up a child care center; people are just too spread out,\" Weeldreyer said. \"So Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore really depend on family child care providers.\"\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the number of available child care spots plummeted. The state hasn't fully recovered and is still \"thousands of licensed slots\" down, Weeldreyer said, but the decline is more dire for family-based care both in Maryland and nationally.\n\n\"The decline in family child care is still egregious,\" Weeldreyer said. \"That was not caused by the pandemic. That's probably close to a 30-year trend.\"\n\nThe situation could be worse than it seems. Weeldreyer said it's difficult to tell how many kids are actually in child care. Her nonprofit is able to pull data daily on how many licenses are active, but that won't necessarily reflect enrollment or attendance -- child care facilities aren't obligated to report those numbers the way public schools are.\n\nThe fewer spots there are, the more expensive those spots become. According to a recent Maryland comptroller report, between 2019 and 2023, the average cost of child care increased by 14% to 30%.\n\nFederal guidance says families should spend no more than 7% of their household income on child care. According to data collected by the Maryland Family Network, there is nowhere in the state where families making their jurisdiction's median income and paying the average cost of child care could meet that goal.\n\nAnd yet, the expense of child care isn't reflected in the wages of those who provide it.\n\nHilary Roberts-King is the executive director of Downtown Baltimore Child Care (DBCC), a nonprofit with three locations offering full-priced, reduced tuition and Early Head Start child care. Roberts-King said about 250 families use the three centers, with kids ranging from 6 weeks to 5 years old.\n\nBecause facilities \"cannot charge the parents enough money to make money doing infant and toddler care,\" centers need to boost their numbers with preschool-aged kids to stay afloat while taking on babies and younger children, for whom care is an expensive undertaking.\n\nAt DBCC, some teachers have been there for 40 years, Roberts-King said. But that isn't the norm.\n\n\"Child care itself is not a good economic model. It relies on families who are at the very beginning of their earning potential,\" Roberts-King said. \"Unfortunately, most of the time, child care is made affordable on the backs of the teachers. And we all know that child care is infamous for its really low wages.\"\n\nAt DBCC, teacher pay can range from $15, Maryland's minimum wage and the rate for DBCC substitute teachers, to $30 an hour.\n\nIn addition to comparably low wages, child care openings often can't compete with more flexible hours and work-from-home options offered in other careers, creating a tight labor market, Roberts-King said.\n\n\"They should be paid everything we have as a society. And we're relying on an economic model that puts people with the least amount of resources to pay people -- who are very, very skilled at what they do -- a very often mediocre salary,\" Roberts-King said. \"Because that's what the parents can afford to pay.\"\n\nBowman homeschooled her first two kids until they were 5, but after going back to school herself in 2022, she knew she would need help with her youngest. And that's been hard to find.\n\n\"We should have different options of things that can help moms because if you want us to go back to work, then we need someone to watch our kids,\" Bowman said.\n\nThe Maryland comptroller's 2023 state of the economy report notes that between 2019 and 2021, 2% of women ages 16-24 and 25-34 dropped out of the labor force in Maryland, compared with 1% and 0.4% nationally. Maryland also lags behind other states when it comes to women returning to the workforce at pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMaryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman said her office believes that both the lack of spots in child care and the high cost of the services are a deterrent to allowing both parents in families to return to the workforce.\n\n\"Because of the pay gap, and other structural forces, it is often a woman who ends up staying home,\" Lierman said. \"That means that we have fewer people in our labor force, and it means that our private sector can't grow as fast as it could be.\n\n\"Our report demonstrates that the need to solve the child care challenge is not -- this is not a women's issue,\" Lierman added. \"This is an issue that our economy depends on getting right.\"", "source":

They put out a call on Facebook. Crickets. They asked their neighbors. Shrugs. When the Schroeders finally found an open slot, it was at an unlicensed center where, after a few weeks, their adopted 18-month-old granddaughter, Madison, came home \"spouting cusswords.\" Their next provider was also unlicensed and would sometimes take Madison with her on other jobs - and not be home when the Schroeders came to pick her up.\n\nThen, eight months after their search began, a member of the couple's church mentioned that she was helping to build a new database of child care providers for the county - and offered to do a search for them. The Schroeders outlined their requirements - preferred location, price, a center that would help them to potty train - and \"she came back with a list of licensed centers and how many openings were available,\" Andrea Schroeder said. \"It made it really easy.\"\n\nThe Schroeders' story rings familiar to millions of American families who urgently need child care and can't find it. More than half of all children - particularly those from low- and middle-income, Hispanic and rural communities - live in a child care desert, which is defined as an area where there are too few licensed slots for the number of children who need care. The crunch only got worse last fall, as the last of $24 billion in pandemic-era funding for child care expired - a funding \"cliff\" that has since been partially remedied in 11 states and Washington, D.C., but not nationwide.\n\nYet in the Schroeders' case, the solution was simple: a database. Such searchable directories are a given in many wealthy industrialized countries, where the state oversees, and often pays for, child care. But in the United States, where you can find nearly anything in seconds online, most child care centers don't even have a website. According to a survey conducted by Upfront, a New York-based software firm that builds child care databases, only about 40 percent of providers have a website - and only a fraction of those are maintained or updated.\n\n\"Imagine you were looking for an apartment and you were only able to see 40 percent of the inventory,\" said Dana Levin-Robinson, Upfront's CEO. \"And of the ones listed, only 20 percent had the price listed and half listed the number of bedrooms. Would you use that? No, you would not.\"\n\nUpfront and a handful of other companies are building on an effort that began in the wake of the pandemic, when state and municipal governments received federal stimulus funds for child care. Now, the private sector is taking note of companies with systems designed to bring the search for child care into the digital age.\n\nThe software firm, BridgeCare, which built the Colorado county's database, works in 14 states including Texas, Alabama and Connecticut - and, in February, announced $10 million in venture capital funding. Upfront has deployed a statewide search in Maryland and will launch in two more states this summer. The Los Angeles-based firm Upwards works with private employers as well as municipalities and has raised more than $43 million to date.\n\nThe $60 billion child care industry has long been ripe for Silicon Valley-style disruption. But the challenges of imposing order on a messy, fragmented system have deterred many venture capitalists with a taste for fast growth.\n\nFor one, aggregating existing data is grueling. Licensing regulations vary from state to state, which makes it hard to build one national system that caters to parents everywhere. The data that is stored electronically is often housed at disparate agencies whose systems don't talk to one another. For example, in New York, the Office of Children and Family Services licenses providers - except in New York City, where center infant and toddler programs are regulated by the Department of Health, while pre-K programs for 3- and 4-year olds are overseen by the Department of Education.\n\nFurthermore, there's no repository for the information most valuable to parents: How much does care cost? What hours are centers open? Which providers have open spots? Another wrinkle is that as many as half of child care providers offer care in their homes. These providers, mostly women, are running small businesses on slim to nonexistent margins, so there's often no one to build a website, maintain a Facebook page, or even answer the phone when desperate parents call.\n\n\"Childcare is the wild west,\" said Laura Weeldreyer, executive director of the Maryland Family Network (MFN), a nonprofit that serves parents and child care providers. \"Enrollment data, price data, attendance data - all the things you need to know - don't exist.\"\n\nWeeldreyer came to MFN after a career in K-12 education, a sector she describes as \"drowning in data.\" In 2022, bolstered by additional funds from the pandemic-era stimulus, MFN hired Upfront to build a statewide searchable database of providers for parents and its team of child care consultants.\n\nCalled LOCATE, it allows parents to instantly see where child care providers are located, what ages they serve and at what price. It also highlights centers that have open spots and provides a messaging platform and contact information. Through recent data-collection campaigns across the state, Upfront identified 1,600 vacancy spots that providers had not previously shared.\n\nWhile these databases can solve the problem of information, it remains unclear whether they can budge the elephant in the room for parents - namely, cost. In 2021, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen called child care \"a textbook example of a broken market.\" According to the Treasury Department, an average family with at least one child under five must spend 13 percent of their income to pay for high-quality child care. Meanwhile, child care workers earn on average just $27,000 a year.\n\nBut what these databases can do is show parents that there are more options than they knew about. According to BridgeCare, which conducted a national survey in 2018, providers say slots remain open for an average of three to four months. And governments employing these systems are optimistic that the data won't just showcase existing availability but help create new spots in the places where they are most needed.\n\nTake Mesa County, where the Schroeders found care. Perched on the western slope of Colorado, it's mostly rural, but many residents work in the county's largest city, Grand Junction. By analyzing search data, the Mesa County Partnership for Children and Families was able to see exactly where in the city parents were looking for care and advise a local child care provider on the best place to open a second center. With the help of BridgeCare's software, the county has been able to boost the number of child care slots available by about 10 percent since 2021.\n\nFor a parent on the hunt for child care, a simple search can feel like a miracle. When Charis\u00e9 Lake-Shenoda, a 33-year-old mother of twin toddlers, moved to Maryland in the fall of 2023, she spent a month searching for child care while working full time. She joined a paid service, which found nothing, and begged colleagues and neighbors for recommendations. She often found herself pushing her children in a stroller during virtual meetings to keep them quiet.\n\nThen, in October, she saw a post on Reddit about LOCATE. \"I went and searched town by town, then emailed a bunch of providers. A woman emailed me back that same afternoon to say she had slots for both children,\" Lake-Shenoda said. \"I started weeping on the phone.\"", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType":

Fried chicken restaurants? Coffee shops? Convenience stores?\n\nAccording to an industry map for self-employed Seoul residents in 2014 by the city government-affiliated Seoul Credit Guarantee Foundation, the answer is child care, which had the highest rate of businesses founded in 2010 that were still operating two years later. It's a survival rate of 95.7%, compared to the 63.3% average for all 43 business types examined.\n\nOne reason for the success is that unlike other businesses, child care providers receive government subsidies.\n\nIn an environment where free child care is being implemented across the board, day care centers certainly warrant establishment as a form of welfare facility. But the practical realities of child care in South Korea are such that many view the centers as a form of self-employment that guarantees at least a high chance of survival.\n\nRecently, day care centers have been up in arms after a government announcement implementing \"customized child care\" as of July 1. The new terms restrict maximum day care center usage for children from single-earner households from 12 hours a day to six. The reduced child care subsidies for the \"customized\" group with restricted hours could translate into lower revenue for the centers.\n\nFrictions between the government and day care centers over the subsidy issue happen almost every year. Parents are united in their disapproval, contending that there is a shortage of trustworthy child care facilities regardless of any policy changes.\n\nA 40-year-old company employee surnamed Choi from a dual-income household has a daughter aged three years and two months. The girl is part of the \"all-day\" group at a day center in the family's apartment complex, but can only use the facility from 10 am to 3 pm. The couple pays one million won (US$860) a month for a babysitter to take her to and from school. Their fear is that the daughter could end up treated as a nuisance by the center if they drop her off before work and pick her up afterwards.\n\n\"It doesn't look much will change after they introduce customized child care,\" Choi said. \"It's not as though the children who were with her before are leaving any later.\"\n\nWhile the group is classified as \"all-day,\" Choi said it was difficult to find any centers that actually provide all-day services.\n\nA survey of 1,045 mothers of infants last year by the Korea Institute of Child Care & Education found 43.5% of them citing \"the lack of trustworthy child care facilities during work hours\" as their single biggest complaint in raising children.\n\n\"When I had the first one, we were 250 on the waiting list for the national and public day care centers we applied to,\" said a 33-year-old mother currently on maternity leave with a two-month-old baby and another child aged 22 months. \"We're still at 180.\"\n\nThe mother also said her child was still eighteenth on the waiting list at a private day care center she applied to three months ago.\n\nWhile one day care center was available for immediate placement, the mother withdrew her child after just two days.\n\n\"There weren't any safety bars on the slide, and the place was very cramped. It seemed unsafe,\" she said.\n\nPeriodic news reports about abuse and accidents at day care centers have only fed the fears of parents.\n\nThe government child care budget for 2016 alone totals 10.5 trillion won (US$9 billion), yet the centers themselves complain of financial problems and parents remain dissatisfied.\n\n\"We have over 40,000 day care centers, yet parents talk about having nowhere to place their children and instructors have to deal with long hours and low wages,\" said Woo Seok-jin, an economics professor at Myongji University.\n\n\"It's a perverse situation where the government is spending massive amounts, yet nobody is sensing any effects from the policy measures.\"\n\nAccording to experts, the root cause of the current problem is a combination of the government's reliance on the private market and its hands-off approach to coordinating day care facilities and managing quality. As of late 2015, South Korea had a total of 42,517 day care centers. National and public-affiliated centers accounted for 2,629, or just 6.2%. In contrast, 86.3% were private day care centers caring for 21 or more children (14,626) or \"family day care centers\" caring for 5 to 20 (22,074). It's the result of an initial government policy approach of leaving matters to a private sector more capable of adding easy numbers rather than expending the effort to expand costlier national and public-affiliated center.\n\nAs of late 2014, the waiting list for national and public day care centers stood at 250,000 - a competition rate of over one in 100. In some regions, families have had to wait as long as three years. Parents prefer the nationally and publicly run centers for their quality of care. The facilities tend to be better, with additional support for instructor staffing costs and responsible oversight by the government.\n\nPrivately run centers, in contrast, are a crapshoot from one region to the next. For the private sector, the government only provides subsidies based on the number of children cared for. Not only is it less support than the nationally and publicly run centers receive, but when numbers dwindle, some of the centers end up barely scraping by. Their response is often to decrease pay to instructors and reduce meal stipends for children. A Ministry of Health and Welfare survey of child care conditions for 2015 showed average monthly salaries of just 1.44 million won (US$1,240) and 1.39 million won (US$1,200) for new instructors at private and family day care centers, respectively.\n\nIf anything, the situation has gotten worse under the free child care policy. The South Korean government has implemented a policy of free child care for all income segments - starting with infants in 2012 and expanding to children up to five years old in 2013. Use of infant day care centers exploded as more and more parents worried they might be missing out. The number of home-based daycare centers - easily arranged by households living in apartments or standalone housing - jumped by 40% from 13,184 in 2007 to 22,074 last year. The number of births declined by 54,489 over the same period. The quality of child care appears to have declined amid growing day care center competition.\n\n\"In the past few years, per capita support for child care costs has basically remained frozen,\" said Kim Hye-gum, a professor of child care studies at Dongnam Health College.\n\n\"Today, it's not really clear whether day care centers are social welfare facilities or profit-oriented private enterprises,\" Kim added.\n\nExperts warn that the child care conflict could continue if the government doesn't take steps to improve service quality and focus its policies on promoting the centers' public service contribution.\n\n\"The government talks about free child care, yet its commitment to expanding nationally and publicly run day care centers remains weak and it says nothing about how it's going to manage the oversupply of private centers,\" said Nary Shin, a professor of child welfare studies at Chungbuk National University.\n\n\"Once 'customized child care' is implemented, day care centers are likely to try to squeeze out a profit and maintain the status quo somehow as their revenues drop,\" Shin predicted.\n\nLee Sang-goo, co-representative of the group Welfare State Society and a specialist in preventative medicine, suggested an approach of increasing the percentage of children attending nationally and publicly run centers by 30%.\n\n\"We also need to promote the public service role of private day care centers with strict assessment and certification, while drastically increasing government support to those that achieve certification and introducing with parents as steering committee members, and an oversight officer,\" Lee suggested.\n\nBy Hwangbo Yon and Lee Jae-uk, staff reporters\n\nPlease direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]",

This stark statistic speaks volumes about our priorities -- or lack thereof -- when it comes to the backbone of our workforce and economic development: child care.\n\nChild care is not just a family issue; it is critical infrastructure that supports the very fabric of our economy. Yet, as federal government initiatives have expanded the child care development block grant funding, West Virginia stands out for the wrong reasons -- we are one of the few states that have consistently decreased matching funds to support this grant. This retreat from responsibility undermines our children's future and our economic stability.\n\nThe federal mandate for enrollment-based funding was a step in the right direction, but it came without the necessary financial support. Now, a $23 million funding gap looms over us for this fiscal year, threatening to disrupt our child care system unless the state steps up to fulfill its duty. Without these funds, child care providers across our state face the grim reality of shutting down, which would compound an already dire situation. Already, 61% of West Virginia employees lack sufficient child care coverage for their children, a gap that will only widen if we fail to act.\n\nThe New River Gorge Regional Development Authority (NRGRDA) recognizes the critical role that consistent, quality child care plays in retaining and attracting new business to the state. As the executive director of NRGRDA, I see first-hand how essential these services are not only to current families but also to prospective businesses considering West Virginia as a home. Quality child care is a key factor in their decision-making process, and our state's ability to provide this can set us apart in the competitive landscape of business development.\n\nGovernor Jim Justice has called a special session that presents a critical opportunity; however, the priorities aren't aligned with the need. We must secure the $23 million needed this fiscal year to ensure that child care providers can continue to operate. Without this funding, every other effort to incentivize or support child care, including tax credits, becomes moot.\n\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to the champions tirelessly working toward solutions, including the West Virginia Association for Young Children, MomsRising, and the numerous providers on the front lines. These organizations and individuals see the challenges and potential solutions first-hand, and their insights are invaluable as we navigate this crisis.\n\nTo our legislators: It is your responsibility to ensure that our state's children and families have the support they need. It is your responsibility to retain the workforce needed throughout West Virginia. Fund the $23 million gap. Listen to and stand with our child care providers. Uphold your duty to the children and families of West Virginia.

However, the sector is well known for being underfunded and highly regulated, resulting in high costs and low profit margins. In turn, the sector is typified by having lower than average compensation, leading to challenges in recruitment and retention.\n\nAs supporters of the child care industry work to increase compensation, one often overlooked avenue is maximizing retention of earnings through tax optimization. While larger businesses have access to information on tax regulations and laws to benefit their operations, child care businesses are often small and operate on thin profit margins, making it difficult to afford adept help. This information asymmetry leads to many providers missing out on deductions or understating them, resulting in a significant financial loss.\n\nFor instance, based on an examination of tax returns from 2018-2022, my company found that the majority of home-based child care providers do not deduct their home expenses, despite the existence of specialized laws designed for their benefit. In our database of 75 providers across Connecticut, New Jersey and Wisconsin, only 71% of eligible providers claimed the home deduction.\n\nAnother commonly missed opportunity stems from the lack of awareness about retirement tax credits. Savings from these credits can even cover a substantial portion of the costs associated with offering this benefit to employees, especially during a time when child care employers are facing a competitive talent landscape.\n\nOur internal database analysis also revealed that, from 2022-2023, on average, child care providers could obtain $7,600 in mitigated taxes, which translates to a 21% increase in gross revenue without any advocacy or change in policy. This finding highlights the untapped potential for child care providers to increase their compensation through proper tax planning and utilization of available deductions and credits.\n\nReal-life examples from my experience further illustrate the impact of tax optimization on child care providers' financial well-being. One home-based business owner with an income of $40,000 had no deductions at all, despite having expenses, resulting in being taxed on their entire income. In contrast, a center-based business owner successfully utilized deductions and depreciation, leading to no taxable income against revenue that increased that year.\n\nThe implications of this opportunity ripple throughout the child care field. For child care business owners, it's important to shift mindsets around taxes from fear and anxiety to embracing the opportunities for retaining more of your hard-earned revenue.\n\nTake the time to learn about the specific tax rules, deductions and credits that apply to your business. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself with your tax preparer to ensure you are maximizing your returns. Consider taking courses or seeking out resources to empower yourself to self-prepare your taxes. The more you understand, the better positioned you'll be to minimize your tax burden and increase your take-home compensation, both at tax time and with your financial planning throughout the year.\n\nBusiness coaches, consultants and financial service providers who support child care businesses also have a key role to play. Integrating tax education into your curriculum and service offerings is crucial for helping clients unlock the full financial potential of their businesses. Child care industry leaders and advocates can also look for ways to bake tax optimization resources into the overall system of support for providers.\n\nTax optimization presents a significant opportunity for child care providers to increase their compensation without relying on policy changes or advocacy efforts. However, it is critical to increase access to information and support so that the industry can empower providers to take advantage of the tax benefits they are entitled to, ultimately leading to a more financially stable and sustainable child care ecosystem.

That's why I turned to cocaine", "text": "Waking from a nap to find masked burglars with knives in your living room sounds nothing short of a nightmare. But it's a horrifying experience Kieran Jones lived through \u2013 one that led the dad-of-two on a downward spiral of drug addiction. The 44-year-old, from Wigan, had fallen asleep on his sofa in late 2019 when he woke to two men standing over him.

The burglars, who Kieran believes were two \u201cchancers\u201d trying door handles along his street, managed to escape before the police arrived. They were never caught. But it wasn\u2019t the only traumatising ordeal the dad endured, the other taking place just a few months earlier. Kieran was on a night out with his mates when he was struck by a vehicle while crossing the road. The hit-and-run driver drove away and was never found. The string of distressing events led to a rapid decline in Kieran\u2019s mental health, eventually seeing him diagnosed with complex PTSD. Isolating himself from society, he lost his job as a granite fitter and most of his friends. He couldn\u2019t shower or even open the curtains inside his home. \u201cI started locking myself away,\u201d he told the Manchester Evening News. \u201cI would find every excuse not to go out. \u201cI had no self-care. I wasn\u2019t washing or showering, I wasn\u2019t opening curtains. I lost my job as a granite fitter. I was put on anti-depressants and they really did zonk me. I started being late every day. \u201cThat\u2019s why I turned to cocaine \u2013 I couldn\u2019t sleep because of the nightmares. I was having flashbacks. Nothing was positive. You feel like the world is against you. Sometimes you go into self-sabotage mode.\u201d Kieran\u2019s poor mental health meant he turned to cocaine as a coping mechanism. But he quickly became gripped by addiction, his dependency becoming so intense he eventually began having seizures. Everything came to a head when the dad tried to take his own life in March 2020, prompting him to admit himself to a mental health facility. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for the NHS because once I reached out to them, I got the support,\u201d he added \u201cIt saved my life. \u201cI\u2019m proud of having mental health. I\u2019ll talk about anything. I could have a relapse in three weeks\u2019 time, but it\u2019s talking that prevents them from escalating. \u201cOnce you become comfortable, you don\u2019t have shame or guilt. It\u2019s brutal; it\u2019s taken me a long time to get to this point.\u201d During Kieran\u2019s journey to better mental health, he created a 12-week fitness programme which led him to setting up his own mental health charity, Bridging Gap Mental Health. Now a mental health peer mentor co-ordinator, his role includes recruiting and training new peer mentors and giving support and advice to others. \u201cOne thing I had when I was coming through recovery and learning how to manage my mental health was the gym,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much more than just the gym, they\u2019ll do yoga, rock climbing, they do exercise sessions and more. \u201cJust moving is a step in the right direction. The simplest activity is going out for a walk. We as a country have some of the best walks, many right on our doorstep. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in that open space, it\u2019s not just the scenery, you\u2019ll go past some flowers and notice the smell and it gives you that awareness, plus you\u2019ll be getting some vitamin D from the natural sunlight as well. \u201cWhatever you feel comfortable with, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to do. So always tailor it to yourself.\u201d Dr Michael Gregory, regional medical director for NHS North West, said: \u201cMoving more can really help your mental health. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to start marathon training just yet \u2013 starting small can help boost your mood. \u201cDancing around the kitchen to your favourite music, walking around the block or even doing some chair exercises while you\u2019re catching up on the TV planner. \u201cBetter still, you can do an exercise routine downloaded to your TV or tablet. It all makes a difference. \u201cSomething like a gentle yoga session, or a walk in a park taking in the nature and surroundings, can also help reset your mind and body. And of course, if you do want to sign up for that marathon, then go for it!\u201d", "summary": "Kieran Jones saw his mental health spiral following the traumatising ordeal - now he's helping others", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/one-day-woke-up-two-29177514", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29194868.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PO_TEM_160524kieran.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:23", "author": "Paige Oldfield", "authors": ["Paige Oldfield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.27}

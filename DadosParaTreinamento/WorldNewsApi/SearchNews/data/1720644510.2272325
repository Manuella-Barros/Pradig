The event followed the leaders\u2019 presence at commemorations for the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings in Normandy on Thursday. The presidents are expected to discuss Ukraine, the war in Gaza, global security and the strengthening of Nato, and policy issues including the climate crisis and naval cooperation. An \u00c9lys\u00e9e source said Macron and Biden had a warm relationship and cited the fact the US president is spending five days in France as evidence of the importance he attributes to the visit. In Paris on Saturday, the leaders oversaw the placing of a large wreath at the flame of the unknown soldier underneath the Arc de Triomphe before a minute\u2019s silence. Afterwards, Biden\u2019s vehicle was accompanied back down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9e by the mounted Republican Guard. The two leaders will hold official talks and share a working lunch before a state banquet for the US president and his wife at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e on Saturday evening. On Thursday during his visit to Normandy for the D-day commemorations, Biden reiterated America\u2019s support for Ukraine and said the US and its allies \u201cwill not bow down\u201d and they would \u201cstand for freedom\u201d. \u201cTo surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply unthinkable,\u201d Biden said in a speech at the American cemetery in Normandy. \u201cIf we were to do that, it means we\u2019d be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\u201d \u201cWe will not walk away because, if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated and it will not end there. Ukraine\u2019s neighbours will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened,\u201d the US president added, describing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as a \u201ctyrant bent on domination\u201d. \u201cThere are things that are worth fighting and dying for,\u201d Biden said. \u201cFreedom is worth it. Democracy is worth it.\u201d Kyiv has been urging Europe to increase its military support for Ukraine after Russian advances in recent months, particularly in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Kharkiv region. On Friday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, warned French parliament that, 80 years after D-day, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 meant Europe was \u201cunfortunately no longer a continent of peace\u201d. He said there could be no peace in Ukraine based on current battle lines. \u201cCan this war end on the lines that exist now? No. Because there are no lines for evil: not 80 years ago, not now. And if someone tries to draw temporary lines, it will only give a pause before a new war.\u201d Max Bergmann, a former US state department official who leads European research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Associated Press that the relationship between the two countries is strong despite occasional disagreements. \u201cThere\u2019s always tension in Franco-American relations, because the French try to do stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re bold, they throw up proposals and that leads to some friction when we push back.\u201d He cited Macron\u2019s suggestion the west could send military trainers to Ukraine suggesting this had the \u201cpotential to be escalatory and dangerous\u201d. He said the French president \u201cpushes the boundaries and throws up ideas\u201d. \u201cFrance is ... our oldest and one of our deepest allies. And this will be an important moment to affirm that alliance and also look to the future and what we have to accomplish together,\u201d Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, told reporters earlier this week.", "summary": "<p>World leaders will spend several days discussing Ukraine, Gaza and global security issues such as strengthening Nato</p><p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Joe Biden marked the start of the US president\u2019s official state visit to France with a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe.</p><p>The event followed the leaders\u2019 presence at commemorations for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2024/jun/06/d-day-80th-anniversary-in-pictures\">the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings</a> in Normandy on Thursday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/emmanuel-macron-welcomes-joe-biden-for-us-state-visit-with-arc-de-triomphe-ceremony\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/08/emmanuel-macron-welcomes-joe-biden-for-us-state-visit-with-arc-de-triomphe-ceremony", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2415eea27c30b63f146c73041ca1724bee54a2/0_301_7994_4799/master/7994.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:05:24", "author": "Kim Willsher", "authors": ["Kim Willsher"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.003}

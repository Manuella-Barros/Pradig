Oil executives also worry that a second Trump administration won't attract staff skillful enough to roll back President Joe Biden's regulations or craft new ones favoring the industry, these people added.\n\nSix energy industry lawyers and lobbyists interviewed by POLITICO described the effort to craft executive orders and other policy paperwork that they see as more effective than anything a second Trump administration could devise on its own. Those include a quick reversal of Biden's pause on new natural gas export permits and preparations for wider and cheaper access to federal lands and waters for drilling.\n\nThe initiative is just one example of the efforts underway from multiple advocacy groups with strong policy agendas -- including abortion-rights opponents -- to fill in the gaps for Trump's potential return to the White House. The presumptive Republican nominee has been a vocal supporter of the oil and gas industry, but the companies often chafed at the effects of his policies as president, including his trade wars and the legal challenges that thwarted some of his pro-fossil-fuel actions.\n\nTrump, who is spending many of his days facing trial in a Manhattan courtroom, has had little time to delve into policy issues with industry officials. In his absence, oil industry officials said they're not sure who speaks for him on the issues they want to address. And while generally unhappy with Biden's attempts to rein in their industry, some have expressed nervousness about what policies Trump might pursue.\n\n\"Other than what Donald Trump says off the cuff, I don't think they're taking much advice on energy strategy,\" Frank Maisano, senior principal at the government relations firm Bracewell, said of the ex-president's campaign. \"He's going to complain about gas prices, he's going to complain about [natural gas], but only in the general sense because the details are complex.\"\n\nSo oil industry lawyers have decided to fill the breach. Industry representatives have already prepared some executive orders for Trump to sign if he reaches the White House, said Stephen Brown, director of energy consulting firm RBJ Strategies and a former refining industry lobbyist. Undoing Biden's actions would be a major target.\n\n\"You'll see a lot of Biden regulations that have come out in the past six months checked one way or another,\" Brown said in an interview. \"It's going to be like shooting fish in the barrel -- there's just so much to go after.\"\n\nThe Biden policies they would seek to unravel include a new fee on leaks of the potent greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas equipment on federal land. The industry also wants to change an Environmental Protection Agency risk management rule focused on preventing refinery accidents, Brown said.\n\nOne energy company lawyer said he was working on executive order language on gas exports and \"a real five-year plan\" for offshore oil leases for a second Trump administration.\n\n\"Supportive industries are going to have to prop up a second Trump administration with expertise,\" said the person, who was granted anonymity to discuss confidential planning. \"We're going to have to write exactly what we want, actually spoon feeding the administration. There's 27-page drafts moving around Washington.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign's Agenda 47 website has listed broad-stroke promises: Cut taxes on oil companies, speed up work for oil and pipeline projects and reverse Biden's pause on gas export permits. But the industry people said they've seen little indication from Trump or those in his orbit what actions he would take to make those promises a reality.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt declined to say who is advising Trump on energy issues, only reiterating the campaign's previous statements that outside groups don't reflect official strategy or policy.\n\nSierra Club managing attorney Elena Saxonhouse said adherence to the fossil fuel industry's agenda would be a continuation of the previous Trump administration, in which industry insiders -- including former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler and oil industry lawyer Dave Bernhardt -- were appointed to Cabinet-level positions to lead agencies dealing with energy and pollution regulations.\n\n\"It's not surprising to me,\" Saxonhouse said in an interview. \"It's absolutely what we would expect for a second Trump term. The administration would be looking out for polluters' interests and not for public health or the environment.\"\n\nMatthew Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters and former EPA scientist, said it's a fairly widespread norm for outside groups to write policy proposals and white papers to inform an incoming administration's policies. But an industry writing exact language for an incoming president to sign is \"beyond the pale,\" he said.\n\n\"It is not shocking, but perhaps a little bold and gross that the oil industry is writing text for executive orders,\" Davis said in an interview.\n\nIn a statement, Biden's campaign spokesperson James Singer said the president believes in building an energy economy for the future by standing up to special interests and producing record amounts of energy.\n\n\"Donald Trump is selling out working families to big oil. Oil companies get huge tax breaks while screwing over consumers and making record profits,\" he said.\n\nTrump hosted energy executives at a dinner last month at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he criticized offshore wind power and said he would end the Biden administration's pause on new gas export licenses, an industry lawyer who attended the event told POLITICO.\n\nAnd he's used his stump speeches to blame Biden for increased energy costs, linking those to inflation and higher interest rates.\n\n\"We must be the most affordable energy and electricity place anywhere on the planet,\" Trump said in last year's rollout of his proposed second term agenda. \"Right now we have energy that is weak, substandard and unaffordable. It's made by the wind.\"\n\nBiden's policies have pushed clean energy development largely through the hundreds of billions of dollars in his signature Inflation Reduction Act as well as the bipartisan infrastructure law. But oil production and natural gas exports have also reached record highs during his term.\n\nWhile Biden has not delivered on his 2020 campaign promise to end new oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters, his administration's regulatory actions have raised the costs for drilling, tightened rules on methane pollution and slowed the pace of lease sales. Those actions in particular are the ones the industry would like to see rolled back first, according to oil and gas executives.\n\nWhile interest groups regularly write policy frameworks and white papers for incoming administrations from both parties, it would be less common for them to write ready-made executive orders or rules for a new president to sign, said Mark Squillace, a former Interior Department official under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"It's not particularly surprising that they'd be engaged,\" Squillace, now a natural resources law professor at the University of Colorado, said of the oil industry advocates. \"These are people who have a strong interest and expertise in an issue. Sometimes the Trump administration might be inclined to sign whatever is put in front of their nose.\"\n\nTrump regularly said things that pleased the industry's collective ears during his first term, but the industry members said the executive orders his aides wrote did little to further the companies' goals. One specific example they cited -- Trump's executive order on \"America-First Offshore Energy,\" a plan to promote offshore oil drilling -- had little impact amid low oil prices and his administration's eventual failure to put together a five-year drilling plan.\n\nThat concern continues, others said. They said the industry doubts that Trump would be able to staff an A-team of experts needed to reverse the parts of Biden's energy policies they don't like.\n\n\"There's a lot of skepticism on what team a new Trump administration could bring in with energy,\" said a person at an industry trade association who was granted anonymity because the person was not authorized to talk to the media. \"The previous time around it was the B team, the C team. Now we're wondering if it's going to be the F team.\"\n\nMandy Gunasekara, a former EPA chief of staff during the Trump administration, said the ex-president regularly talks to people in the oil industry to discuss policy ideas and doesn't rely on any particular advisers. Gunasekara stressed she wasn't speaking as a campaign surrogate.\n\nWhat a second Trump administration would likely do upon taking office is scour the Biden administration's policy actions and decide \"do we rescind it, do we amend it or do we keep it as is,\" Gunasekara said in an interview. She wrote a section on reshaping the EPA for the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a sprawling set of policy recommendations written by Trump supporters and former aides.\n\nTrump's main energy policy aim would be \"to jump start the economy and reduce the cost burden on the American people that they've been feeling ever since Biden walked into the White House,\" Gunasekara added.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Those actions in particular are the ones the industry would like to see rolled back first, according to oil and gas executives.\n\nWhile interest groups regularly write policy frameworks and white papers for incoming administrations from both parties, it would be less common for them to write ready-made executive orders or rules for a new president to sign, said Mark Squillace, a former Interior Department official under President Bill Clinton.\n\n\"It's not particularly surprising that they'd be engaged,\" Squillace, now a natural resources law professor at the University of Colorado, said of the oil industry advocates. \"These are people who have a strong interest and expertise in an issue. Sometimes the Trump administration might be inclined to sign whatever is put in front of their nose.\"\n\nTrump regularly said things that pleased the industry's collective ears during his first term, but the industry members said the executive orders his aides wrote did little to further the companies' goals. One specific example they cited -- Trump's executive order on \"America-First Offshore Energy,\" a plan to promote offshore oil drilling -- had little impact amid low oil prices and his administration's eventual failure to put together a five-year drilling plan.\n\nThat concern continues, others said. They said the industry doubts that Trump would be able to staff an A-team of experts needed to reverse the parts of Biden's energy policies they don't like.\n\n\"There's a lot of skepticism on what team a new Trump administration could bring in with energy,\" said a person at an industry trade association who was granted anonymity because the person was not authorized to talk to the media. \"The previous time around it was the B team, the C team. Now we're wondering if it's going to be the F team.\"\n\nMandy Gunasekara, a former EPA chief of staff during the Trump administration, said the ex-president regularly talks to people in the oil industry to discuss policy ideas and doesn't rely on any particular advisers. Gunasekara stressed she wasn't speaking as a campaign surrogate.\n\nWhat a second Trump administration would likely do upon taking office is scour the Biden administration's policy actions and decide \"do we rescind it, do we amend it or do we keep it as is,\" Gunasekara said in an interview. She wrote a section on reshaping the EPA for the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a sprawling set of policy recommendations written by Trump supporters and former aides.\n\nTrump's main energy policy aim would be \"to jump start the economy and reduce the cost burden on the American people that they've been feeling ever since Biden walked into the White House,\" Gunasekara added.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal lands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_R._Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew R.

At the dinner, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens of President Joe Biden's environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted, according to people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\n\nGiving $1 billion would be a \"deal,\" Trump said, because of the taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him, according to the people.\n\nTrump's remarkably blunt and transactional pitch reveals how the former president is targeting the oil industry to finance his reelection bid. At the same time, he has turned to the industry to help shape his environmental agenda for a second term, including the rollbacks of some of Biden's signature achievements on clean energy and electric vehicles.\n\nThe contrast between the two candidates on climate policy could not be more stark. Biden has called global warming an \"existential threat,\" and over the last three years, his administration has finalized 100 new environmental regulations aimed at cutting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, restricting toxic chemicals, and conserving public lands and waters. In comparison, Trump has called climate change a \"hoax,\" and his administration weakened or wiped out more than 125 environmental rules and policies over four years.\n\nIn recent months, the Biden administration has raced to overturn Trump's environmental actions and issue new ones before the November election. So far, Biden officials have overturned 27 Trump actions affecting the fossil fuel industry and completed 23 new actions affecting the sector, according to a Washington Post analysis. The Interior Department, for instance, recently blocked future oil drilling across 13 million acres of the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nDespite the oil industry's complaints about Biden's policies, the United States is now producing more oil than any country ever has, pumping nearly 13 million barrels per day on average last year. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest U.S. energy companies, reported their biggest annual profits in a decade last year.\n\nYet oil giants will see an even greater windfall -- helped by new offshore drilling, speedier permits and other relaxed regulations -- in a second Trump administration, the former president told the executives over the dinner of chopped steak at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump vowed at the dinner to immediately end the Biden administration's freeze on permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports -- a top priority for the executives, according to three people present. \"You'll get it on the first day,\" Trump said, according to the recollection of an attendee.\n\nThe roughly two dozen executives invited included Mike Sabel, the CEO and founder of Venture Global, and Jack Fusco, the CEO of Cheniere Energy, whose proposed projects would directly benefit from lifting the pause on new LNG exports. Other attendees came from companies including Chevron, Continental Resources, Exxon and Occidental Petroleum, according to an attendance list obtained by the Post.\n\nTrump told the executives that he would start auctioning off more leases for oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, a priority that several of the executives raised. He railed against wind power, as the Post previously reported. And he said he would reverse the restrictions on drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\n\"You've been waiting on a permit for five years; you'll get it on Day 1,\" Trump told the executives, according to the recollection of the attendee.\n\nAt the dinner, Trump also promised that he would scrap Biden's \"mandate\" on electric vehicles -- mischaracterizing ambitious rules that the Environmental Protection Agency recently finalized, according to people who attended. The rules require automakers to reduce emissions from car tailpipes, but they don't mandate a particular technology such as EVs. Trump called them \"ridiculous\" in the meeting with donors.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has aggressively lobbied against the EPA's tailpipe rules, which could eat into demand for its petroleum products. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry trade group, has launched a seven-figure campaign against what it calls a de facto \"gas car ban.\" The campaign includes ads in battleground states warning that the rule will restrict consumer choice.\n\n\"Clearly, if you are producing gasoline and diesel, you want to make sure that there's enough market there,\" said Stephen Brown, an energy consultant and a former lobbyist for Tesoro, an oil refining company. \"I don't know that the oil industry would walk in united with a set of asks for the Trump administration, but I think it's important for this issue to get raised.\"\n\nAlthough the repeal of the EPA rule would benefit the fossil fuel industry, it would probably anger the auto industry, which has invested billions of dollars in the transition away from gasoline-powered cars. Many automakers are under increasing pressure to sell more EVs in Europe, which has tightened its own tailpipe emissions rules, and they are eager to avoid a patchwork of regulations around the globe.\n\n\"Automakers need some degree of regulatory certainty from government,\" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and other car companies.\n\n\"What has emerged instead is a wholesale repeal ... and then reinstatement ... and then repeal again of regulations every four or eight years,\" Bozzella said in an email.\n\nBiden's EV policies have also sparked opposition in rural, Republican-led states such as North Dakota, where there are far more oil pump jacks than charging stations. A key figure leading the Trump campaign's development of its energy policy is Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has been talking extensively to oil donors and CEOs.\n\nAt a fundraiser on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla., Burgum told donors that Trump would halt Biden's \"attack\" on fossil fuels, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by the Post.\n\n\"What would be the No. 1 thing that President Trump could do on Day 1? It's stop the hostile attack against all American energy, and I mean all,\" Burgum said. \"Whether it's baseload electricity, whether it's oil, whether it's gas, whether it's ethanol, there is an attack on liquid fuels.\"\n\nBurgum also criticized the Biden administration's policies on gas stoves and vehicles with internal combustion engines, falsely claiming that they would prevent consumers from buying both technologies.\n\n\"They've got some liberal idea about what products we need,\" Burgum said. \"You all need EV cars. You don't need internal combustion. We'll decide what kind of car you're going to drive, and we're going to regulate the other ones out of business. I mean, it's just in every industry, not just in cars, not just in energy. They're telling people what stoves you can buy. This is not America.\"\n\nWhile the Energy Department recently set new efficiency standards for gas stoves, they would not affect the stoves in people's kitchens or those currently on the market. The Biden campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nBurgum has pushed harder to address climate change than many other Republicans, setting a goal in 2021 for North Dakota -- the third-largest oil-producing state -- to become carbon-neutral by 2030. He has stressed, however, that the goal won't be achieved via government mandates or the elimination of fossil fuels.\n\nBurgum's approach to climate policy makes him an unusual messenger for Trump, who has falsely called global warming a hoax invented by China. But many oil executives view Burgum -- a possible contender to lead the Energy Department in a second Trump term -- as sympathetic to their concerns, and he has cultivated deep support among oil donors.\n\nDespite Trump's huge fundraising ask, oil donors and their allies have yet to donate hundreds of millions to his campaign. They have contributed more than $6.4 million to Trump's joint fundraising committee in the first three months of this year, according to an analysis by the advocacy group Climate Power. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm and others are scheduling a fundraiser for Trump later this year, advisers said, where they expect large checks to flow to his bid to return to office.\n\nOne person involved in the industry said many oil executives wanted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or another Republican to challenge Biden. But now that Trump is the nominee, this person said, they are going to embrace his policies and give.\n\nDan Eberhart, chief executive of the oil-field services company Canary and a Trump donor, said the Republican onslaught of donations was not surprising.\n\n\"Biden constantly throws a wet blanket to the oil and gas industry,\" Eberhart said. \"Trump's 'drill baby drill' philosophy aligns much better with the oil patch than Biden's green-energy approach. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nAlex Witt, a senior adviser for oil and gas with Climate Power, said Trump's promise is he will do whatever the oil industry wants if they support him. With Trump, Witt said, \"everything has a price.\"\n\n\"They got a great return on their investment during Trump's first term, and Trump is making it crystal clear that they're in for an even bigger payout if he's reelected,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At the dinner, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens of President Biden's environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted, according to people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.\n\nGiving $1 billion would be a \"deal,\" Trump said, because of the taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him, according to the people.\n\nTrump's remarkably blunt and transactional pitch reveals how the former president is targeting the oil industry to finance his reelection bid. At the same time, he has turned to the industry to help shape his environmental agenda for a second term, including the rollbacks of some of Biden's signature achievements on clean energy and electric vehicles.\n\nThe contrast between the two candidates on climate policy could not be more stark. Biden has called global warming an \"existential threat,\" and over the last three years, his administration has finalized 100 new environmental regulations aimed at cutting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, restricting toxic chemicals, and conserving public lands and waters. In comparison, Trump has called climate change a \"hoax,\" and his administration weakened or wiped out more than 125 environmental rules and policies over four years.\n\nIn recent months, the Biden administration has raced to overturn Trump's environmental actions and issue new ones before the November election. So far, Biden officials have overturned 27 Trump actions affecting the fossil fuel industry and completed 23 new actions affecting the sector, according to a Washington Post analysis. The Interior Department, for instance, recently blocked future oil drilling across 13 million acres of the Alaska Arctic.\n\nDespite the oil industry's complaints about Biden's policies, the United States is now producing more oil than any country ever has, pumping nearly 13 million barrels per day on average last year. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest U.S. energy companies, reported their biggest annual profits in a decade last year.\n\nYet oil giants will see an even greater windfall - helped by new offshore drilling, speedier permits and other relaxed regulations - in a second Trump administration, the former president told the executives over the dinner of chopped steak at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump vowed at the dinner to immediately end the Biden administration's freeze on permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports - a top priority for the executives, according to three people present. \"You'll get it on the first day,\" Trump said, according to the recollection of an attendee.\n\nThe roughly two dozen executives invited included Mike Sabel, the CEO and founder of Venture Global, and Jack Fusco, the CEO of Cheniere Energy, whose proposed projects would directly benefit from lifting the pause on new LNG exports. Other attendees came from companies including Chevron, Continental Resources, Exxon and Occidental Petroleum, according to an attendance list obtained by The Post.\n\nTrump told the executives that he would start auctioning off more leases for oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, a priority that several of the executives raised. He railed against wind power, as The Post previously reported. And he said he would reverse the restrictions on drilling in the Alaska Arctic.\n\n\"You've been waiting on a permit for five years; you'll get it on Day 1,\" Trump told the executives, according to the recollection of the attendee.\n\nAt the dinner, Trump also promised that he would scrap Biden's \"mandate\" on electric vehicles - mischaracterizing ambitious rules that the Environmental Protection Agency recently finalized, according to people who attended. The rules require automakers to reduce emissions from car tailpipes, but they don't mandate a particular technology such as EVs. Trump called them \"ridiculous\" in the meeting with donors.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has aggressively lobbied against the EPA's tailpipe rules, which could eat into demand for its petroleum products. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry trade group, has launched a seven-figure campaign against what it calls a de facto \"gas car ban.\" The campaign includes ads in battleground states warning that the rule will restrict consumer choice.\n\n\"Clearly, if you are producing gasoline and diesel, you want to make sure that there's enough market there,\" said Stephen Brown, an energy consultant and a former lobbyist for Tesoro, an oil refining company. \"I don't know that the oil industry would walk in united with a set of asks for the Trump administration, but I think it's important for this issue to get raised.\"\n\nAlthough the repeal of the EPA rule would benefit the fossil fuel industry, it would probably anger the auto industry, which has invested billions of dollars in the transition away from gasoline-powered cars. Many automakers are under increasing pressure to sell more EVs in Europe, which has tightened its own tailpipe emissions rules, and they are eager to avoid a patchwork of regulations around the globe.\n\n\"Automakers need some degree of regulatory certainty from government,\" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and other car companies.\n\n\"What has emerged instead is a wholesale repeal... and then reinstatement... and then repeal again of regulations every four or eight years,\" Bozzella said in an email.\n\nBiden's EV policies have also sparked opposition in rural, Republican-led states such as North Dakota, where there are far more oil pump jacks than charging stations. A key figure leading the Trump campaign's development of its energy policy is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R), who has been talking extensively to oil donors and CEOs.\n\nAt a fundraiser on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla., Burgum told donors that Trump would halt Biden's \"attack\" on fossil fuels, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by The Post.\n\n\"What would be the No. 1 thing that President Trump could do on Day 1? It's stop the hostile attack against all American energy, and I mean all,\" Burgum said. \"Whether it's baseload electricity, whether it's oil, whether it's gas, whether it's ethanol, there is an attack on liquid fuels.\"\n\nBurgum also criticized the Biden administration's policies on gas stoves and vehicles with internal combustion engines, falsely claiming that they would prevent consumers from buying both technologies.\n\n\"They've got some liberal idea about what products we need,\" Burgum said. \"You all need EV cars. You don't need internal combustion. We'll decide what kind of car you're going to drive, and we're going to regulate the other ones out of business. I mean, it's just in every industry, not just in cars, not just in energy. They're telling people what stoves you can buy. This is not America.\"\n\nWhile the Energy Department recently set new efficiency standards for gas stoves, they would not affect the stoves in people's kitchens or those currently on the market. The Biden campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nBurgum has pushed harder to address climate change than many other Republicans, setting a goal in 2021 for North Dakota - the third-largest oil-producing state - to become carbon-neutral by 2030. He has stressed, however, that the goal won't be achieved via government mandates or the elimination of fossil fuels.\n\nBurgum's approach to climate policy makes him an unusual messenger for Trump, who has falsely called global warming a hoax invented by China. But many oil executives view Burgum - a possible contender to lead the Energy Department in a second Trump term - as sympathetic to their concerns, and he has cultivated deep support among oil donors.\n\nDespite Trump's huge fundraising ask, oil donors and their allies have yet to donate hundreds of millions to his campaign. They have contributed more than $6.4 million to Trump's joint fundraising committee in the first three months of this year, according to an analysis by the advocacy group Climate Power. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm and others are scheduling a fundraiser for Trump later this year, advisers said, where they expect large checks to flow to his bid to return to office.\n\nOne person involved in the industry said many oil executives wanted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or another Republican to challenge Biden. But now that Trump is the nominee, this person said, they are going to embrace his policies and give.\n\nDan Eberhart, chief executive of the oil-field services company Canary and a Trump donor, said the Republican onslaught of donations was not surprising.\n\n\"Biden constantly throws a wet blanket to the oil and gas industry,\" Eberhart said. \"Trump's 'drill baby drill' philosophy aligns much better with the oil patch than Biden's green-energy approach. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nAlex Witt, a senior adviser for oil and gas with Climate Power, said Trump's promise is he will do whatever the oil industry wants if they support him. With Trump, Witt said, \"everything has a price.\"\n\n\"They got a great return on their investment during Trump's first term, and Trump is making it crystal clear that they're in for an even bigger payout if he's reelected,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He also vowed to auction off more offshore oil drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico, and reverse recently enacted restrictions on drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\n\"You've been waiting on a permit for five years; you'll get it on Day 1,\" Trump promised, per the source's recollection.\n\nThe GOP presidential nominee also vowed to end a \"mandate\" on electric vehicles from the Biden administration, a misrepresentation of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules that encourage a shift but do not require one.\n\nDespite industry complaints about Biden, oil and gas production in the U.S. have hit record levels during his term. Although Biden recently overturned 27 Trump-era actions that benefited oil companies, he has also approved nearly twice the amount of oil and gas permits for wells on federal land that Trump did during his first three years in office; last year, Exxon and Chevron, the largest U.S. energy companies, notched their highest annual profits in a decade.\n\nThe news of Trump's meeting with fossil fuel executives comes on the heels of reports that the GOP nominee's campaign is receiving other aid from oil executives, including drafts of potential executive orders and policies he can enact if he wins in November.\n\nAccording to these reports, fossil fuel industry leaders view Trump's comments on energy-related matters -- including his statements to voters on gas prices and oil production -- as an indication that he supports their goals, but also as mere campaign fodder.

Attendees included executives from Exxon Mobil Corp., EQT Corp. and the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry.\n\nThe event was organized by oil billionaire Harold Hamm, who has for years helped to shape Republican energy policies. It was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nTrump has publicly railed for months against President Joe Biden's energy and environmental agenda, as Biden has raced to restore and strengthen dozens of climate and conservation rules that Trump had weakened or erased while in office. In particular, Trump has promised to eliminate Biden's new climate rules intended to accelerate the nation's transition to electric vehicles, and to push a \"Drill, baby, drill\" agenda aimed at opening up more public lands to oil and gas exploration.\n\nBiden has called climate change an existential threat and has moved to cut the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet and supercharging storms, heat waves and drought.\n\nOver a dinner of chopped steak, Trump repeated his public promises to delete Biden's pollution controls, telling the attendees that they should donate heavily to help him beat Biden because his policies would help their industries.\n\n\"That has been his pitch to everybody,\" said Michael McKenna, who worked in the Trump White House but did not attend the event in Florida.\n\nMcKenna said the former president's appeal to the fossil fuel industry could be summed up as: \"Look, you want me to win. You might not even like me, but your other choice is four more years of these guys,\" referring to the Biden administration. He added, \"The uniform sentiment of guys in the business community is 'We don't want four more years of Team Biden.'\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBiden's presidential campaign on Thursday accused Trump of \"straight up selling out working families for campaign donations from oil barons.\"\n\nBiden has frustrated the fossil fuel industry by pursuing the most ambitious climate agenda in the nation's history. He has signed a sweeping law that pumps $370 billion into incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles and has enacted a suite of tough regulations designed to sharply reduce emissions from the burning of oil, gas and coal.\n\nThis year, the Biden administration paused the permitting process for new facilities that export liquefied natural gas in order to study their impact on climate change, the economy and national security.\n\nBut the fossil fuel industry has also enjoyed record profits under the Biden administration. Last year, the United States produced record amounts of oil. And even with the pause in new permits for gas export terminals, the United States is the world's leading exporter of natural gas and is still on track to nearly double its export capacity by 2027 because of projects already permitted and under construction.\n\nBiden has also approved several oil and gas projects sought by the fossil fuel industry.\n\nHe has authorized an enormous $8 billion oil development in Alaska known as the Willow project. He also granted a crucial permit for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a project championed by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., despite opposition from climate experts and environmental groups. Last month, undeterred by opposition from climate activists, the Biden administration also gave approval for an oil export project in Texas known as the Sea Port Oil Terminal.\n\nSome oil and gas executives have said that they would prefer some of Biden's regulations to remain, such as a rule requiring companies to detect and stop methane leaks from oil and gas wells. They said they wanted consistency rather than an endless pattern of regulatory whiplash in which rules are enacted by one administration, repealed by the next and restored by the one after that.\n\nMany, however, have attacked Biden's policies, and the industry has contributed heavily to Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nAlthough attendees were told that Trump's event was an energy roundtable, waiting on the chairs of executives and lobbyists at Mar-a-Lago were printouts of PowerPoint slides about migrants at the southern border.\n\nPart of the meeting dwelled on migration, and Trump declared he wanted separate divisions of Ultimate Fighting Championship fighters: one designated for immigrants who came across the border illegally, and the other for \"Americans.\"\n\nThe room was filled predominantly with oil and gas executives, including Mike Sabel, CEO and founder of Venture Global LNG; Toby Rice, president and CEO of EQT Corp.; Jack Fusco, CEO of Cheniere Energy; and Nick Dell'Osso, president of Chesapeake Energy.\n\nAlso in the room were North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a former Republican presidential candidate who has been acting as Trump's point person on energy issues; and Hamm, executive chair of Continental Resources, which is among the biggest oil and gas drilling companies in Oklahoma and North Dakota.\n\nTrump - accompanied by Susie Wiles, his top political adviser; Taylor Budowich, a former aide; and Meredith O'Rourke, a fundraiser - asked the executives to detail their concerns on energy issues, according to the two attendees.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute, the nation's top fossil fuel industry group, is running an eight-figure national advertising campaign to promote fossil fuels and \"dismantle policy threats,\" Mike Sommers, CEO of the trade group, has said. Separately, the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents petroleum refiners, has started to buy ads in nine battleground states urging Americans to fight Biden's regulation on tailpipe emissions.\n\nAnd states with Republican attorneys general have filed legal challenges against most, if not all, of Biden's regulations, including a suit announced Thursday by 27 states arguing that the administration overstepped its authority in cracking down on smokestack pollution from power plants.\n\nBut Trump told executives they were not fighting hard enough. He also went on a rant about windmills, the attendees said. Trump has falsely claimed that wind turbines cause cancer and that offshore wind farms are \"driving whales crazy.\"\n\nTrump did not request money in exchange for killing Biden's climate regulations, the two people in the room maintained. Rather, the former president told executives that he was determined to squash what he considered anti-business policies, and that the oil industry should therefore want him to win and should raise $1 billion to ensure his success.\n\nHamm has had Trump's ear on energy issues dating back to the former president's 2016 campaign and pushed him to appoint Scott Pruitt to run the Environmental Protection Agency, where Pruitt denied the established science of climate change and unravelled environmental protections.\n\nAfter Trump lost the 2020 election, Hamm briefly supported some of the former president's rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. But the oil tycoon appeared to have had a change of heart. Hamm donated $3,300 to Trump's campaign last year, the maximum allowed for a primary contribution, and another $3,300 in March, according to campaign filings.\n\nHamm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. McKenna said Hamm continued to play an outsize role in Trump's energy policy. \"If Harold has an idea, the rest of us have to chase it around,\" he said. \"Harold Hamm wants that LNG pause gone. He wants the California waiver and the tailpipe rule gone.\"\n\nCalifornia has for decades received waivers under the Clean Air Act that authorize it to set environmental rules that are tougher than federal regulations. To do business in California, automakers and other industries must comply with its rules. Trump has promised to revoke California's waivers.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The $1 billion sum would ultimately be a \"deal\" for the fossil fuel industry, Trump reportedly told the executives, because of the money they would save with him in office. An anonymous industry source told the Post that Trump is likely to get some funds.\n\nThe oil and fossil fuel industry has long made its alliances with the Republican Party, which generally supports and promotes fossil fuels. Ahead of the 2024 election, the industry has been drawing up \"ready-to-sign\" executive orders for Trump if he wins the presidency, aimed at expanding natural gas exports and increasing offshore oil leases, Politico reported this week.\n\nA second Trump term would mean a sharp departure from Biden's agenda of clean energy, electric vehicles and historic efforts to fight climate change. The former president has falsely called global warming a \"hoax\" and has vowed to unravel Biden's landmark climate programs included in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nRepublicans have spent the entirety of Biden's term condemning what they describe as the administration's \"war\" on energy, even though U.S. oil production and exports of natural gas have never been higher. They accuse Biden of being beholden to \"radical environmentalists\" -- an ironic talking point given Trump and the GOP's unflinching loyalty to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIn Congress, Republicans have tried to undo many of the Biden administration's recent environmental rules, including those regulating tailpipe emissions and heavy-duty trucks. Last week, House Republicans passed a package of bills that, among other things, would reverse Biden's actions to limit drilling across millions of acres in Alaska and to better protect public lands by putting conservation and ecosystem restoration on equal footing with drilling, mining and other extractive uses.\n\nThe Biden administration is racing to finalize as many regulations as possible before Republicans would have an opportunity under Trump to roll them back via the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a few months' time to rescind new rules implemented by the White House. If Trump becomes president, however, he could still undo them unilaterally.\n\nTrump appears to be laying the groundwork to quickly implement many of the policy priorities of Project 2025, the sweeping blueprint that right-wing organizations have compiled to guide Trump if he is reelected in November. Certain sections of that pro-Trump memorandum are little more than an oil industry wish list. As HuffPost previously reported, the energy section of the chapter for the Interior Department was authored by Kathleen Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, a prominent oil and gas trade association.\n\nTrump's quid pro quo with the industry comes as the world's coral reefs are in the midst of a global bleaching event -- only the fourth such event on record. Hundreds of climate scientists told The Guardian this week that global temperatures are on track to soar well beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the aspirational goal of the landmark Paris climate accords.\n\nFor years, scientists have warned about the disastrous consequences of failing to keep temperatures under the 1.5-degree mark, from rising seas and increasingly extreme weather to famines and severe social and economic disruptions. The fossil fuel industry is most responsible for the crisis and has spent decades denying and downplaying the threat, with the help of industry-allied Republicans.\n\nDemocrats criticized Trump for cozying up to fossil fuel executives, warning that it would further erode American democracy.\n\n\"Big Oil CEOs will happily use the billions they've made selling dirty expensive energy to further warp American democracy, if it means they can keep wrecking the planet for free,\" Sen.

The goal of the orders would be to roll back some of the Biden administration's most progressive environmental regulations, such as halting natural gas export permits, slashing vehicle carbon emissions, and penalizing gas companies for methane leaks.\n\nFrank Maisano, a senior principal at government relations firm Bracewell, told Politico that \"other than what Donald Trump says off the cuff, I don't think [Trump's campaign is] taking much advice on energy strategy.\" While the ex-president routinely complains about gas prices and mocks clean-energy initiatives at his rallies, he otherwise fails to discuss environmental policy.\n\nOil industry lawyers have taken it upon themselves to fill the gap, drafting executive orders undoing Biden's policies if Trump's put back in the White House, according to Stephen Brown, a former lobbyist and director of energy consulting firm RBJ Strategies.\n\n\"You'll see a lot of Biden regulations that have come out in the past six months checked one way or another,\" Brown told Politico.\n\nThe Trump campaign's policy website, Agenda 47, states Trump wants to \"drill, baby, drill\" to increase oil and natural gas production domestically in order to lower consumer energy costs, regardless of the environmental impact. The website also states that \"President Trump will once again exit the horrendously unfair Paris Climate Accords,\" referring to the 2015 Paris Agreement which set a goal of capping global temperature increase to under 2\u00b0C, and aiming for a limit of 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nA poll published by The Guardian on Wednesday, which included responses from 380 of 843 climate scientists with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, found that more than three-quarters believe we will not only fail to meet that goal, but we will be far above it.\n\nOnly 22 of the 380 experts, about six percent, said they expected global temperatures to remain at or below 1.5\u00b0C, which was chosen as a target goal to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. Meanwhile, 77 percent of the surveyed scientists predict Earth will remain on pace for 2.5\u00b0C warming or greater by 2100, which could cause widespread famine, flooding, wildfires, and other natural disasters all over the world, forcing millions to become climate refugees.\n\nThe poll also asked the scientists why they thought the global response to climate change was not measuring up to stated goals. Nearly 75 percent cited a lack of political will, while 60 percent cited vested corporate interests -- like the oil and gas industry insiders setting the table for a second Trump term.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_childs@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jeremy Childs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Methane emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/trump-executive-orders-climate-change.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552337", "eventUri": "eng-9552337", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He would also overturn the Biden administration's decision in January to pause new natural gas export permits which have been denounced as \"climate bombs\".\n\n\"You'll get it on the first day,\" Trump said, according to the Post, citing an unnamed dinner attendee.\n\nTrump's exhortation to the oil executives that they were wealthy enough to pour $1bn into his campaign war-chest, at the same time pledging a U-turn on Biden's efforts to combat the climate crisis, was immediately denounced on Wednesday by environmental groups.\n\n\"$1bn for Trump, a devastating climate future for the rest of us,\" said Pete Maysmith of the League of Conservation Voters (LCV).\n\nChristina Polizzi of Climate Power told the Guardian that Trump was \"putting the future of the planet up for sale\".\n\n\"He is in the pocket of big oil - he gave them $25bn in tax breaks in his first term - and now it's clear he is willing to do whatever big oil wants in a potential second term.\"\n\nThe former president's exchange with fossil fuel giants also engaged the concern of groups monitoring the influence of money in politics. Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (Crew), a non-partisan government watchdog, said the conversation, as reported by the Post, \"certainly looks a lot like quid pro quo\".\n\nLibowitz said the encounter was \"about as blatant as I've ever seen. Politicians often give a nudge and a wink, they don't say raise a billion dollars for me and I'll get rid of the regulations that you want.\"\n\nHe added that Crew's legal team were looking into whether this rises to the high legal standard of bribery.\n\nTrump's close relations to the oil industry, and his hostility to federal regulations designed to reduce emissions that exacerbate the climate crisis, are well-known and longstanding. With six months to go until the presidential election, however, he is stepping up his efforts to attract campaign donations from the sector.\n\nTrump is also performing strongly in the polls. Having all but certainly secured the Republican nomination, Trump is often narrowly ahead of Joe Biden in surveys of the presidential race, including performing strongly in the key swing states that are vital to any candidate's chances of victory. Trump's solid performance comes despite a swath of legal woes, including currently being on trial in New York over an alleged hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nFor their part, executives in big oil companies have been preparing for a possible Trump second term by drafting executive orders designed to be ready to sign as soon as he returns to office. Politico reported this week that the executives have clubbed together to produce off-the-shelf policies on increasing natural gas exports, supercharging drilling and extending offshore oil leases.\n\nThe interplay between Trump and the oil giants as the election approaches underlines the vast gulf between the former president and the current occupant of the White House. According to an analysis by a group of environmental groups including the Sierra Club and LCV, the Biden administration has taken more than 300 actions towards greater public health and clean energy, more than any other administration in US history.\n\nThose measures included the first major climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, which has propelled record investment in clean energy including solar and wind and increased sales of electric vehicles. US energy emissions are slowly declining, by some 3% this year.\n\nEven so, the US is extracting more oil and gas than ever, reaching almost 13m barrels of crude oil a day - more than double the production levels a decade ago.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

He would also overturn the Biden administration's decision in January to pause new natural gas export permits which have been denounced as \"climate bombs\".\n\n\"You'll get it on the first day,\" Trump said, according to the Post, citing an unnamed dinner attendee.\n\nTrump's exhortation to the oil executives that they were wealthy enough to pour $1bn into his campaign war-chest, at the same time pledging a U-turn on Biden's efforts to combat the climate crisis, was immediately denounced on Wednesday by environmental groups.\n\n\"$1bn for Trump, a devastating climate future for the rest of us,\" said Pete Maysmith of the League of Conservation Voters (LCV).\n\nChristina Polizzi of Climate Power told the Guardian that Trump was \"putting the future of the planet up for sale\".\n\n\"He is in the pocket of Big Oil - he gave them $25bn in tax breaks in his first term - and now it's clear he is willing to do whatever Big Oil wants in a potential second term.\"\n\nThe former president's exchange with fossil fuel giants also engaged the concern of groups monitoring the influence of money in politics. Jordan Libowitz of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (Crew), a non-partisan government watchdog, said the conversation, as reported by the Post, \"certainly looks a lot like quid pro quo\".\n\nLibowitz said the encounter was \"about as blatant as I've ever seen. Politicians often give a nudge and a wink, they don't say raise a billion dollars for me and I'll get rid of the regulations that you want\".\n\nHe added that Crew's legal team were looking into whether this rises to the high legal standard of bribery.\n\nTrump's close relations to the oil industry, and his hostility to federal regulations designed to reduce emissions that exacerbate the climate crisis, are well-known and long-standing. With six months to go until the presidential election, however, he is stepping up his efforts to attract campaign donations from the sector.\n\nTrump is also performing strongly in the polls. Having all but certainly secured the Republican nomination, Trump is often narrowly ahead of Joe Biden in surveys of the presidential race, including performing strongly in the key swing states that are vital to any candidate's chances of victory. Trump's solid performance comes despite a swathe of legal woes, including currently being on trial in New York over an alleged hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nFor their part, executives in big oil companies have been preparing for a possible Trump second term by drafting executive orders designed to be ready to sign as soon as he returns to office. Politico reported this week that the executives have clubbed together to produce off-the-shelf policies on increasing natural gas exports, supercharging drilling and extending offshore oil leases.\n\nThe interplay between Trump and the oil giants as the election approaches underlines the vast gulf between the former president and the current occupant of the White House. According to an analysis by a group of environmental groups including the Sierra Club and LCV, the Biden administration has taken more than 300 actions towards greater public health and clean energy, more than any other administration in US history.\n\nThose measures included the first major climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, which has propelled record investment in clean energy including solar and wind and increased sales of electric vehicles. US energy emissions are slowly declining, by some 3% this year.\n\nEven so, the US is extracting more oil and gas than ever, reaching almost 13m barrels of crude oil per day - more than double the production levels a decade ago.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_pilkington@theguardian.com", "name": "Ed Pilkington",

on permits for new liquified natural gas (LNG) exports.\n\nHe also reportedly told the energy executives -- about two dozen from companies including Venture Global, Cheniere Energy, Chevron and Exxon -- he would auction off more oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico and reverse restrictions on drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nBiden's 2022 climate action plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, funnels some

Executives from Exxon, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, and other prominent fossil fuel companies reportedly attended the Mar-a-Lago dinner.\n\nLate last year, Trump said he would be a dictator on the first day of his second term, vowing to use his executive authority to \"close the border\" and \"drill, drill, drill\" for the fossil fuels that are driving global temperatures to catastrophic extremes and imperiling hopes for a livable future.\n\nThe Post reported Thursday that Trump said a $1 billion investment in his run against Democratic President Joe Biden would be a \"deal\" for Big Oil \"because of the taxation and regulation they would avoid thanks to him.\"\n\n\"The contrast between the two candidates on climate policy could not be more stark,\" the Post noted. \"Biden has called global warming an 'existential threat' and over the last three years, his administration has finalized 100 new environmental regulations aimed at cutting air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, restricting toxic chemicals, and conserving public lands and waters. In comparison, Trump has called climate change a 'hoax,' and his administration weakened or wiped out more than 125 environmental rules and policies over four years.\"\n\nWill Bunch, a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer, wrote in response to the Post's reporting that \"you won't read a more important story today.\"\n\n\"Trump is willing to literally destroy the planet for $1 billion,\" Bunch added.\n\n\"Republicans want to sell you out to Big Oil to line their pockets.\"\n\nIn recent months, Trump and his allies have laid out how they intend to resume and accelerate that destructive deregulatory blitz if the former president wins another term in November.\n\nProject 2025, a coalition of dozens of right-wing organizations including the Heritage Foundation, crafted a detailed presidential transition guide that calls for a dramatic expansion of U.S. fossil fuel infrastructure, aggressive rollbacks of climate rules, and steep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nMeanwhile, as Politicoreported Wednesday, fossil fuel industry lawyers and lobbyists are in the process of \"drawing up ready-to-sign executive orders for Donald Trump aimed at pushing natural gas exports, cutting drilling costs, and increasing offshore oil leases in case he wins a second term.\"\n\n\"Six energy industry lawyers and lobbyists interviewed by Politico described the effort to craft executive orders and other policy paperwork that they see as more effective than anything a second Trump administration could devise on its own,\" the outlet noted. \"Those include a quick reversal of Biden's pause on new natural gas export permits and preparations for wider and cheaper access to federal lands and waters for drilling.\"\n\nA recent study estimated that a Trump victory in 2024 could result in an additional 4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by the end of the decade, inflicting more than $900 billion in global climate damages.\n\nSo far, the fossil fuel industry and their allies have donated more than $6.4 million to Trump's joint fundraising committee in the first three months of 2024, the Post noted Thursday, citing an analysis by Climate Power.\n\nThe Texas Tribunereported earlier this week that the oil and gas sector \"has contributed more than $25 million to the GOP and conservative groups compared to $3.6 million to Democrats\" thus far in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nHarold Hamm, a billionaire oil tycoon, is planning to hold a fundraiser for Trump's reelection bid later this year, according to the Post.\n\nCiting the Post's reporting, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. (D-N.J.) said Thursday that Trump \"demanded a straight-up billion-dollar bribe from oil executives.\"\n\n\"Republicans want to sell you out to Big Oil to line their pockets,\" said Pascrell.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki",

Trump pledged to immediately end the Biden administration's freeze on permits for new liquified natural gas (LNG) exports.\n\nHe also reportedly told the energy executives -- about two dozen from companies including Venture Global, Cheniere Energy, Chevron and Exxon -- he would auction off more oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico and reverse restrictions on drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nMore

So far, Biden officials have overturned 27 Trump actions affecting the fossil fuel industry and completed 23 new actions affecting the sector, according to a Washington Post analysis. The Interior Department, for instance, recently blocked future oil drilling across 13 million acres of the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nDespite the oil industry's complaints about Biden's policies, the United States is now producing more oil than any country ever has, pumping nearly 13 million barrels per day on average last year. ExxonMobil and Chevron, the largest US energy companies, reported their biggest annual profits in a decade last year.\n\nYet oil giants will see an even greater windfall - helped by new offshore drilling, speedier permits and other relaxed regulations - in a second Trump administration, the former president told the executives over the dinner of chopped steak at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump vowed at the dinner to immediately end the Biden administration's freeze on permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports - a top priority for the executives, according to three people present. \"You'll get it on the first day,\" Trump said, according to the recollection of an attendee.\n\nThe roughly two dozen executives invited included Mike Sabel, the CEO and founder of Venture Global, and Jack Fusco, the CEO of Cheniere Energy, whose proposed projects would directly benefit from lifting the pause on new LNG exports. Other attendees came from companies including Chevron, Continental Resources, Exxon and Occidental Petroleum, according to an attendance list obtained by The Post.\n\nTrump told the executives that he would start auctioning off more leases for oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, a priority that several of the executives raised. He railed against wind power, as The Post previously reported. And he said he would reverse the restrictions on drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\n\"You've been waiting on a permit for five years; you'll get it on Day 1,\" Trump told the executives, according to the recollection of the attendee.\n\nAt the dinner, Trump also promised that he would scrap Biden's \"mandate\" on electric vehicles - mischaracterising ambitious rules that the Environmental Protection Agency recently finalised, according to people who attended. The rules require automakers to reduce emissions from car tailpipes, but they don't mandate a particular technology such as EVs. Trump called them \"ridiculous\" in the meeting with donors.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry has aggressively lobbied against the EPA's tailpipe rules, which could eat into demand for its petroleum products. The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry trade group, has launched a seven-figure campaign against what it calls a de facto \"gas car ban.\" The campaign includes ads in battleground states warning that the rule will restrict consumer choice.\n\n\"Clearly, if you are producing gasoline and diesel, you want to make sure that there's enough market there,\" said Stephen Brown, an energy consultant and a former lobbyist for Tesoro, an oil refining company. \"I don't know that the oil industry would walk in united with a set of asks for the Trump administration, but I think it's important for this issue to get raised.\"\n\nAlthough the repeal of the EPA rule would benefit the fossil fuel industry, it would probably anger the auto industry, which has invested billions of dollars in the transition away from gasoline-powered cars. Many automakers are under increasing pressure to sell more EVs in Europe, which has tightened its own tailpipe emissions rules, and they are eager to avoid a patchwork of regulations around the globe.\n\n\"Automakers need some degree of regulatory certainty from government,\" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and other car companies.\n\n\"What has emerged instead is a wholesale repeal... and then reinstatement... and then repeal again of regulations every four or eight years,\" Bozzella said in an email.\n\nBiden's EV policies have also sparked opposition in rural, Republican-led states such as North Dakota, where there are far more oil pump jacks than charging stations. A key figure leading the Trump campaign's development of its energy policy is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R), who has been talking extensively to oil donors and CEOs.\n\nAt a fundraiser on Saturday in Palm Beach, Fla., Burgum told donors that Trump would halt Biden's \"attack\" on fossil fuels, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by The Post.\n\n\"What would be the No. 1 thing that President Trump could do on Day 1? It's stop the hostile attack against all American energy, and I mean all,\" Burgum said. \"Whether it's baseload electricity, whether it's oil, whether it's gas, whether it's ethanol, there is an attack on liquid fuels.\"\n\nBurgum also criticised the Biden administration's policies on gas stoves and vehicles with internal combustion engines, falsely claiming that they would prevent consumers from buying both technologies.\n\n\"They've got some liberal idea about what products we need,\" Burgum said. \"You all need EV cars. You don't need internal combustion. We'll decide what kind of car you're going to drive, and we're going to regulate the other ones out of business. I mean, it's just in every industry, not just in cars, not just in energy. They're telling people what stoves you can buy. This is not America.\"\n\nWhile the Energy Department recently set new efficiency standards for gas stoves, they would not affect the stoves in people's kitchens or those currently on the market. The Biden campaign declined to comment for this story.\n\nBurgum has pushed harder to address climate change than many other Republicans, setting a goal in 2021 for North Dakota - the third-largest oil-producing state - to become carbon-neutral by 2030. He has stressed, however, that the goal won't be achieved via government mandates or the elimination of fossil fuels.\n\nBurgum's approach to climate policy makes him an unusual messenger for Trump, who has falsely called global warming a hoax invented by China. But many oil executives view Burgum - a possible contender to lead the Energy Department in a second Trump term - as sympathetic to their concerns, and he has cultivated deep support among oil donors.\n\nDespite Trump's huge fundraising ask, oil donors and their allies have yet to donate hundreds of millions to his campaign. They have contributed more than $US6.4 million to Trump's joint fundraising committee in the first three months of this year, according to an analysis by the advocacy group Climate Power. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm and others are scheduling a fundraiser for Trump later this year, advisers said, where they expect large checks to flow to his bid to return to office.\n\nOne person involved in the industry said many oil executives wanted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or another Republican to challenge Biden. But now that Trump is the nominee, this person said, they are going to embrace his policies and give.\n\nDan Eberhart, chief executive of the oil-field services company Canary and a Trump donor, said the Republican onslaught of donations was not surprising.\n\n\"Biden constantly throws a wet blanket to the oil and gas industry,\" Eberhart said. \"Trump's 'drill baby drill' philosophy aligns much better with the oil patch than Biden's green-energy approach. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nAlex Witt, a senior adviser for oil and gas with Climate Power, said Trump's promise is he will do whatever the oil industry wants if they support him. With Trump, Witt said, \"everything has a price.\"\n\n\"They got a great return on their investment during Trump's first term, and Trump is making it crystal clear that they're in for an even bigger payout if he's reelected,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So why does it hate him?", "body": "Among west Texas oilmen, the lesser prairie-chicken is a subject that quickly raises hackles.\n\nThe unusual-looking animal famed for its elaborate mating dance roams the scrubland of the vast Permian Basin -- the epicentre of US oil production -- and was listed as endangered last year. Its new status now restricts where, when and how oil can be drilled.\n\nFor the industry, the rights granted to the bird are emblematic of the regulatory onslaught it claims to have suffered at the hands of President Joe Biden, who executives believe will bring about the ruin of their sector.\n\n\"It's death by 1,000 cuts,\" says Steve Pruett, chief executive of Elevation Resources, sitting in his office in Midland, Texas. \"It's the worst presidency with regard to energy policy I've ever seen -- and I've been involved in energy for 40 years, my entire career.\"\n\nAfter the regulatory bonfire of Donald Trump's four years in office, Biden made tackling climate change a central priority for his administration and vowed to crack down on America's oil and gas industry. He has brought in environmental rules that range from endangered species protections and a clampdown on methane leaks to restrictions on offshore leasing and the suspension of new licences for the multibillion-dollar terminals needed to liquefy American gas and ship it abroad.\n\nTo many Democratic voters, such restrictions are long overdue. But in Midland, the west Texas frontier town where George W Bush spent his childhood, they have made Biden an unpopular man. The city sits at the heart of the Permian, which at 6.1mn barrels a day pumps more than Opec powerhouses such as Kuwait, Iraq or the UAE -- and has made the US the biggest oil producer in history.\n\nWith six months to go until the presidential election in November, energy policy has emerged as a key battleground between Biden and Trump. The former president is attempting to harness the discontent by telling voters in fossil fuel states that, if re-elected, he would adopt a policy of \"drill, baby, drill\".\n\nYet the rhetoric of the two candidates belies an inconvenient truth for both: America's oil and gas industry has flourished under Biden. At more than 13mn b/d, production is at record levels, exports of American hydrocarbons have surged and the scale of annual profits has been unprecedented -- largely driven by a jump in commodity prices following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nInvestors in the industry have reaped rewards too, as cash-rich producers showered them with returns. Shares in ExxonMobil have more than doubled since Biden took office and, emboldened by high prices, the industry has also splurged on mergers and acquisitions, making some of the biggest deals in decades.\n\nFor many in oil and gas, however, such successes have occurred in spite of the White House -- not because of it. Escalation of the regulatory clampdown under a second Biden administration could cause real long-term damage, they warn, chasing away capital and hurting production in the years ahead.\n\n\"In Biden's campaign to become president, he said he was going to end the oil and gas industry -- he is doing that,\" says Stephen Robertson, executive vice-president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association.\n\n\"There have been over 200 actions taken by this administration opposed to the oil and gas industry,\" he adds. \"There's not one of these that will be the end of the industry\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but there's going to be a straw that breaks the camel's back.\"\n\nBut Ali Zaidi, Biden's national climate adviser, counters that claims the administration has declared war on the industry is a \"misplaced characterisation\" of its intentions.\n\n\"The focus is not on a firm. The focus is not on a fuel. The focus is on emissions -- and on setting our country up to win the economy of the future,\" Zaidi says. \"The global consensus is that the world needs to transition away from fossil fuels on an accelerating pace in this decade and obviously continuing into the decades that follow.\"\n\nBiden had successfully steered clear of the topic of the oil industry's future during the 2020 election campaign.\n\nBut in the dying minutes of the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, Biden declared that, if elected, he \"would transition away from the oil industry\".\n\n\"The oil industry pollutes significantly,\" he said, responding to repeated badgering by Trump. \"It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.\"\n\nThe remarks four years ago sent a shudder through the oil industry from Texas to North Dakota. \"It's like being in the cattle business and him saying they're going to take away beef from the grocery stores,\" says Kirk Edwards, an oil executive based in Odessa, 20 miles from Midland.\n\nBiden hit the ground running. On his first day in office he signed an order revoking a crucial permit for the Keystone XL pipeline -- in effect killing an $8bn project designed to shuttle oil from Alberta, Canada, to Gulf Coast refineries.\n\nMore policies followed: a temporary suspension of drilling on public lands; freezing and then scrapping leases in an Arctic wildlife refuge; and introducing a charge on methane leaks, the country's first nationwide fee on a greenhouse gas, to the delight of environmental groups.\n\n\"From day one, the Biden administration has made a strong commitment to addressing climate change,\" says Alexandra Adams at the National Resources Defense Council, a non-profit.\n\nBut in February 2022, when Vladimir Putin ordered tanks into Ukraine, Biden's approach changed. As petrol prices soared, the president and his advisers -- fearful of a hammering in that year's midterm elections -- urged US drillers to pump more oil. He also pledged to help replace Europe's reliance on Russian gas by encouraging US liquefied natural gas exports to the continent.\n\nAs a result of higher prices, 2022 was the most profitable year on record for publicly traded US oil companies. The country's top-10 listed operators by value amassed a combined net income of $313bn in the first three years of the Biden administration, almost triple the amount in the same period under Trump. Oil and gas production in the US hit record levels in 2023.\n\n\"One of the great ironies of President Biden's first term is that he campaigned on a pledge to address climate change and make significant changes to oil and gas policies, yet through this first term, profits and production for these companies have both boomed,\" says Andrew Gillick, a managing director at energy consultancy Enverus.\n\nHow much of this windfall can be placed at Biden's door is a topic that stirs intense debate. Despite the vitriol and political rhetoric, the ability of an incumbent president to influence oil production is limited, say analysts, with market forces beyond Washington's control the key driver.\n\nAs prices escalated and profits for producers skyrocketed, the industry and the White House clashed. Biden lashed out at ExxonMobil, which he said was making \"more money than God.\" Then he called Chevron boss Mike Wirth \"sensitive\" after the executive accused him of seeking to \"vilify\" the industry.\n\nAn uneasy truce followed as Biden sought to avoid policies that could be deemed to contribute to high oil prices that might be felt at the petrol pump. He waved through ConocoPhillips's $8bn Willow project in Alaska to the dismay of his progressive base. His administration's landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, included legal provisions that tied future development of renewable energy to holding oil and gas auctions.\n\nBut ahead of a tough re-election campaign, tensions between the president and the industry have resurfaced. Biden has implemented a slew of policies cracking down on oil and gas: suspending new licences for LNG terminals; restricting offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico; and issuing strict tailpipe emissions rules to push Americans towards electric vehicles.\n\nThis has riled the industry, which is waging a multipronged legal battle against the administration, arguing that the new rules will hurt America's ability to produce in the years ahead and undermine the energy security of the US and its allies.\n\n\"We need predictability. And when governments change rules at the drop of a hat without much consultation that sends a signal that if you're going to invest in that place your investment may be at risk,\" says Mike Sommers, head of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry body.\n\nIn January, the institute launched a multimillion-dollar pre-election advertising blitz to promote increased oil and gas development and to work towards dismantling what it sees as threats to the industry, including some Biden climate policies.\n\nIn Midland, local industry players say the policies hit smaller businesses hardest as they lack the financial firepower to comply. \"For the small guys, it's even more of a daunting reality, because we don't have the balance sheet to lean on like our publicly traded friends to go tackle some of these mandates that are slowly trickling out,\" says Jared Blong, chief executive of Midland-based Octane Energy.\n\nA roadside billboard in Somerset, Pennsylvania -- paid for by groups linked to the fossil fuel industry -- highlights how Biden's energy policies have become an important campaign issue in resource-rich states.\n\n\"Stop the BS and Wasted Tax dollars: You Need Energy from Fossil Fuels to live,\" it reads, alongside a photograph of local Republican politician Camera Bartolotta. A conservative group, Job Creators Network, is also running adverts in the state criticising Biden's LNG pause.\n\nPennsylvania, America's second-largest shale gas producing state after Texas, is one of a handful of swing states that will determine who wins the White House. Trump triumphed in the state in 2016, but four years later it was Biden who won there by a narrow margin.\n\nBiden's decision to freeze new LNG permits has not been well received in the state, where about 80,000 people work in the oil and gas sector. In contrast, Trump received rapturous applause at a rally last month when he told supporters he would immediately scrap it if he won. Local Democratic politicians, including governor Josh Shapiro, who is a close ally of Biden, have distanced themselves from the controversial policy and called for its swift repeal.\n\nFrackers warn the pause is destabilising the industry at a time when gas prices have fallen to near record lows due to oversupply. \"When you look at the war on our industry this has a chilling effect and it does threaten jobs,\" says Toby Rice, chief executive of EQT, one of the largest gas producers in the US, which is based near Pittsburgh. \"Voters know that when you pause LNG, you pause natural gas development and you pause our ability to keep natural gas prices affordable for Americans.\"\n\nThe pause highlights the tightrope the president has had to walk on energy policy as the election draws near. It was widely viewed as an effort to boost support among environmentally conscious younger voters, many of whom are disillusioned not only by the Biden administration's record on climate but also on other issues, such as the war in Gaza.\n\nA CNN poll last month showed Biden trailing Trump by 11 points among young people, with 40 per cent of voters aged 18 to 34 saying they will vote for him, compared with 51 per cent for Trump.\n\n\"Young people are more sceptical now,\" says Sof Petros, a 26-year-old climate activist who lives in Seattle, pointing to the Willow project in Alaska as one particular disappointment. She adds: \"I don't see young people I work with on climate issues voting for Trump but frankly the real danger is that they don't vote at all.\"\n\nBut the pause has galvanised opposition within the oil and gas industry, with big donors who initially funded Republican rivals such as Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis pouring money into the Trump campaign.\n\nIt has received about $7mn from the oil and gas industry, according to the non-profit OpenSecrets, with $500,000 coming through his official campaign and the rest coming through affiliated super Pacs -- aligned groups that can pull in unlimited donations from mega donors.\n\nAmong the largest donors are George Bishop of Texas oil producer GeoSouthern Energy and Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer, one of North America's biggest pipeline groups, who have given $1mn and $815,000, respectively.\n\nHarold Hamm, founder of Continental Resources -- one of the industry's most vocal Biden critics -- has contributed just over $200,000 to Trump groups, although he initially backed Haley.\n\n\"We have what we call punitive regulation and punitive policy that has been brought about by this administration,\" says Hamm, adding that a Biden win would be \"disastrous\" for hydrocarbon production.\n\nThe industry has also funnelled tens of millions of dollars into the campaign war chests of congressional candidates this cycle, according to OpenSecrets, with contributions to Republicans outnumbering those to Democrats nearly seven to one, in line with other cycles since 2012.\n\nAll of the top 10 recipients of oil and gas money since the beginning of this campaign cycle are Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and House majority leader Steve Scalise. Among Democrats, the only campaigns in the House to receive more than $100,000 from the oil and gas industry are a handful of candidates running for office in Texas.\n\nBut despite the industry's bankrolling of Republicans, there remain deep concerns about a second Trump presidency, particularly among companies with overseas operations.\n\nMany executives privately worry that the former president's volatility on the world stage could undermine the sector, especially if he became embroiled in tit-for-tat tariff wars that could hurt trade and undermine demand.\n\nHis promise to significantly increase production is also unlikely to become a reality, analysts say, pointing to investors' insistence on returns over expensive and risky drilling campaigns.\n\nTrump has also promised to rip up the IRA, whose lucrative tax breaks for hydrogen and carbon capture are benefiting oil companies including Exxon, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. This pledge may also alarm Republicans whose constituencies have benefited from the billions being invested in clean energy and technology under the legislation.\n\n\"It is hard to know what Trump's position is: you never know if it is going to change from day to day,\" says Mary Landrieu, a former Democratic US senator and now a lobbyist with oil and gas clients. \"The industry is caught between Trump and Biden.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian_Basin_(North_America)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Permian Basin (North America)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Endangered species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midland, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Midland, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefied_natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquefied natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Methane emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Permian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_of_petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraction of petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrocarbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

The oil executives reportedly balked at the transactional nature of Trump's comments.\n\nSpending $1 billion to send him back to the White House would be a \"deal\" for the executives in attendance because of all the regulation and taxes they would avoid if he were in office, Trump said, according to the Post.\n\nExecutives from Chevron, Exxon, and Occidental Petroleum were among the attendees, the Post reported. The Trump campaign, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune. Representatives from Exxon declined to comment.\n\nIncluded in those future regulatory cuts was a promise to undo a series of regulations meant to encourage automakers to invest in and manufacture more electric vehicles. The specific policy limits the amount of carbon emissions allowed from a car's tailpipes. The new regulation essentially forces car companies to make more electric vehicles, which don't have any tailpipe emissions. A transition away from gas-powered vehicles toward electric vehicles would harm energy companies that produce the gasoline that powers the cars targeted by the policy. According to the Post, Trump called the policy \"ridiculous.\"\n\nThat regulation in particular has drawn the attention of the oil and gas companies, which have spent millions in a lobbying campaign against it. They claim the policy is a de facto ban on combustion engine vehicles. The rule has also encountered strong resistance at the state level. Last month, just a few weeks after the regulation was announced, a group of 25 states sued to stop it on the grounds it would hurt the economy.\n\nTrump's promise to reverse the regulation as soon as he took office comes at a time when the EV industry is already underwater. It's facing declining consumer demand and industrywide struggles to develop a national charging network. Lawmakers around the world have also seized on the electric vehicle transition as a political boogeyman they say would raise prices for consumers and hurt domestic energy companies. President Joe Biden's administration has moved to incentivize EV adoption, offering a $7,500 tax credit for households that bought one.\n\nShould Trump's hopes come to fruition, they could upset some of the carefully laid plans of U.S. automakers that have invested billions on electric vehicles. GM, Ford, and Stellantis have all pledged to open factories specifically for EVs and the batteries that power them across the country. However, all three recently pared back their plans amid waning consumer demand.\n\nThroughout the meeting Trump reportedly also promised to get rid of other current regulations that energy companies have lobbied against. For example, Trump said he would remove the pause on export permits on liquified natural gas that the Biden administration had implemented, as it evaluated their environmental impact. During the exchange Trump also told executives that he would allow oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Alaskan Arctic.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

During the 2016 election, for example, he said what everyone knew but no politicians would acknowledge: That wealthy donors bought access and fealty with their contributions.\n\nThese blunt statements have endeared him to supporters who see Trump as a rare figure willing to speak about how special interests and corporations conspire with politicians to screw over ordinary Americans. And because he is a billionaire, they see him as immune to these pressures, wealth enough to not be beholden in the same way as typical politicians.\n\nThat brings us to a Washington Post article this morning. At a Mar-a-Lago meeting in April, oil executives complained that despite pouring hundreds of millions into lobbying the government, the Biden administration had pursued stronger environmental regulations. \"Trump's response stunned several of the executives in the room overlooking the ocean: You all are wealthy enough, he said, that you should raise $1 billion to return me to the White House,\" the Post reports. In exchange, Trump vowed to roll back current regulations and freeze future ones. He told them given the savings, a billion bucks would be a \"deal\" for them.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The utter absurdity of Donald Trump and RFK Jr. running as \"outsiders\"\n\nWhat Trump is offering is entirely legal and absolutely corrupt. (Or to borrow a phrase: very legal and very uncool.) Thanks to Trump's bluntness, there can be no hair-splitting about what's going on here, and that's good for public understanding. Trump is asking special interests for an eye-popping fee in exchange for giving them explicit favors. Trump and the oil companies might argue (dubiously) that their preferred regime would actually be better for consumers, but they are cutting 'the people' out of the discussion entirely, subverting democracy. The deal gets done between Trump and the suits, behind closed doors. It's a good reminder that Trump's claim to being an outsider is a sham.\n\nAmerican politics would be healthier if all politicians were so transparent about such deals (though, of course, it would be better were they not making such deals at all). Everyone might \"know\" that politicians are cutting deals for powerful interests, but they seldom know what exactly those deals are, so it's hard for them to take it into account when voting. (This is one reason the federal indictment of Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat, is so riveting: The alleged trades are all laid out so plainly.)\n\nTrump, however, has said he's different. Many people took his frankness about how the system works to mean that he wouldn't act the same way as the politicians he excoriated. What this report shows is he's no different. Trump was describing transactionalism, not critiquing it, and the idea that Donald Trump would ever object to transactionalism is absurd. He's a grandee in good standing of the Leopards Eating Faces Party.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Bob Menendez never should have been a senator this long in the first place\n\nIn fact, he's arguably worse. An ordinary politician might have approached this situation with a touch more finesse. First, he'd listen to the executives' concerns. Then, he'd lay out his agenda on energy. Finally, a campaign aide would hit the executives up for donations. That offers a little bit of deniability, which in turns gives a politician in office some wiggle room. It's not like donors can call him up and say, you made an explicit promise to do this for me! That would be unseemly. If the oil suits produce a billion and Trump wins, however, they can do exactly that, since he's offered an explicit quid pro quo. Not only is he just as beholden to special interests as anyone else, here he's going out of his way to make himself beholden.\n\nOne final tawdry thing about Trump's offer is the implicit threat it contains. If they don't pass the hat to produce the cash, Trump might not pursue the same policies -- and as he notes, that could cost them dearly.\n\nTim Naftali: The worst president in history\n\nTrump runs a real risk to his reputation, as well as his election, by being quite so direct about what he's offering. One of the biggest scandals in American political history was Teapot Dome, which involved federal officials trading favors to the oil business in exchange for cash. It's one reason that Warren Harding, the president at the time, has often been ranked among the very worst by historians. (Trump has surpassed him in some recent surveys thanks to his attempt to steal the 2020 election.)\n\nVoters just don't like corruption very much, and Trump's offer here is not only plainly corrupt but cuts to the center of the political persona he has cultivated.

What is news is how far Trump may go.\n\nThere's new reporting in The Washington Post that Trump, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, asked oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign so that he could upend efforts by Biden to push the US toward clean energy and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the transactional nature of the pitch, as relayed to the Post, is overt and somewhat shocking, it's not out of step with Trump's view of politics or his insistence that climate change is a \"hoax.\" For evidence that climate change is not a hoax, read this CNN story about ocean temperatures. Or look at the pictures of hundreds of thousands of dead fish killed by a heat wave in Vietnam.\n\nI talked to CNN climate reporter Ella Nilsen about Trump's plans for a second term and Biden's record on climate change. Among the interesting things I learned is that a lot of the money Biden and Democrats have spent to spur manufacturing has gone to red states.\n\nWOLF: The Washington Post reports that Trump is promising oil executives a friendly administration if they raise $1 billion for his campaign. Politico reports the oil industry is crafting executive orders Trump could sign on day one. Trump has promised - in his \"dictator for a day\" fantasy - to act on immigration and energy production first. What do we know about how different US energy policy would be under Trump?\n\nNILSEN: In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration.\n\nBiden's administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump's actions - in some places enacting even stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump has vowed to again reverse course from Biden; he wants to give a boost to fossil fuels and oil and gas drilling in particular.\n\nWOLF: For all their rhetorical differences on climate, it's not like the US has cut oil production under Biden. In fact, the US remains the No. 1 world oil producer by a long shot. How do climate activists rate the current administration?\n\nNILSEN: Climate activists have a mixed view of Biden.\n\nOn the one hand, he delivered on the most ambitious piece of climate legislation in modern history. His administration has also finalized some pretty ambitious regulations cutting planet-warming pollution, conserved a lot of public lands and created an American Climate Corps - a key demand of activists.\n\nOn the other hand, the administration greenlit the massive new oil drilling project in Alaska known as Willow, which galvanized a huge amount of opposition from youth climate groups and on social media. Youth climate groups want Biden to use executive authority to stop drilling for fossil fuels - something that likely won't happen as oil and gas production booms in the US.\n\nWOLF: The money for climate in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was backed by Democrats only, was sold as the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate policy. Are we seeing it pay off?\n\nNILSEN: Yes, so far. The IRA has already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new US manufacturing, largely for clean-energy industries like EVs, battery plants, and solar and wind production.\n\nA lot of this funding has been clustered in red states, but other 2024 swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia have been big benefactors.\n\nWOLF: Is that a political move, or does it just have to do with the fact that it gets windy in Texas?\n\nNILSEN: You're right, it's very windy in a lot of red states - red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota are big wind-energy producers and consumers.\n\nBut there are other reasons too. For instance, it's easier to permit and build in some red states, and others have relaxed union labor laws, another factor that draws big businesses.\n\nWOLF: I've been seeing a lot of stories about a backlash to EVs. Trump falsely says Biden wants to ban gas-powered vehicles. How big a part does a transition to EVs play in addressing climate change?\n\nNILSEN: The vehicles we drive play a huge role in addressing climate change.\n\nTransportation emissions account for a little less than a third of total US emissions - the biggest individual sector for greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nEven accounting for mining for the critical minerals needed for EV batteries, EVs are much cleaner than gas-powered vehicles - assuming the power used to charge them is also coming from clean sources.\n\nWOLF: Even before Biden took office, states like California were taking the lead in a more climate-focused energy policy. Would that continue even if Trump wins?\n\nNILSEN: Yes, blue states like California and Washington state and even some Midwestern, purple states like Michigan and Minnesota have passed some very ambitious climate laws through their legislatures. That work will continue in the states even if Trump is elected.\n\nBut given how quickly we're running out of time to get the planet's warming under control, it will be important to have the federal government moving in that direction as well.\n\nWOLF: Better than presidents taking executive action or the Environmental Protection Agency writing a regulation to address the climate would be lawmakers passing a major piece of climate legislation. Are there any indications of movement toward a new national energy policy?\n\nNILSEN: Lawmakers passing the IRA was a huge achievement in its own right; however, multiple lawmakers have said the IRA was just the start.\n\nGiven the 2017 Trump tax cuts are expiring soon, and Congress will have to take up tax policy in 2025, there's already chatter about a possible carbon tax, or a carbon tariff on polluting products like cement and steel, coming up in the legislature.\n\nOf course, what's possible in Congress depends tremendously on which party is in power - and who is in the White House.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

What is news is how far Trump may go.\n\nThere's new reporting in The Washington Post that Trump, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago, asked oil executives to raise $1 billion for his campaign so that he could upend efforts by Biden to push the US toward clean energy and electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the transactional nature of the pitch, as relayed to the Post, is overt and somewhat shocking, it's not out of step with Trump's view of politics or his insistence that climate change is a \"hoax.\" For evidence that climate change is not a hoax, read this CNN story about ocean temperatures. Or look at the pictures of hundreds of thousands of dead fish killed by a heat wave in Vietnam.\n\nI talked to CNN climate reporter Ella Nilsen about Trump's plans for a second term and Biden's record on climate change. Among the interesting things I learned is that a lot of the money Biden and Democrats have spent to spur manufacturing has gone to red states.\n\nWOLF: The Washington Post reports that Trump is promising oil executives a friendly administration if they raise $1 billion for his campaign. Politico reports the oil industry is crafting executive orders Trump could sign on day one. Trump has promised - in his \"dictator for a day\" fantasy - to act on immigration and energy production first. What do we know about how different US energy policy would be under Trump?\n\nNILSEN: In his first term, Trump overturned more than 100 environmental rules and actions put in place by the Obama administration.\n\nBiden's administration has spent much of its tenure undoing Trump's actions - in some places enacting even stronger regulations on planet-warming pollution coming from vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump has vowed to again reverse course from Biden; he wants to give a boost to fossil fuels and oil and gas drilling in particular.\n\nWOLF: For all their rhetorical differences on climate, it's not like the US has cut oil production under Biden. In fact, the US remains the No. 1 world oil producer by a long shot. How do climate activists rate the current administration?\n\nNILSEN: Climate activists have a mixed view of Biden.\n\nOn the one hand, he delivered on the most ambitious piece of climate legislation in modern history. His administration has also finalized some pretty ambitious regulations cutting planet-warming pollution, conserved a lot of public lands and created an American Climate Corps - a key demand of activists.\n\nOn the other hand, the administration greenlit the massive new oil drilling project in Alaska known as Willow, which galvanized a huge amount of opposition from youth climate groups and on social media. Youth climate groups want Biden to use executive authority to stop drilling for fossil fuels - something that likely won't happen as oil and gas production booms in the US.\n\nWOLF: The money for climate in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was backed by Democrats only, was sold as the largest-ever investment in clean energy and climate policy. Are we seeing it pay off?\n\nNILSEN: Yes, so far. The IRA has already spurred hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in new US manufacturing, largely for clean-energy industries like EVs, battery plants, and solar and wind production.\n\nA lot of this funding has been clustered in red states, but other 2024 swing states like Michigan, Arizona and Georgia have been big benefactors.\n\nWOLF: Is that a political move, or does it just have to do with the fact that it gets windy in Texas?\n\nNILSEN: You're right, it's very windy in a lot of red states - red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and South Dakota are big wind-energy producers and consumers.\n\nBut there are other reasons too. For instance, it's easier to permit and build in some red states, and others have relaxed union labor laws, another factor that draws big businesses.\n\nWOLF: I've been seeing a lot of stories about a backlash to EVs. Trump falsely says Biden wants to ban gas-powered vehicles. How big a part does a transition to EVs play in addressing climate change?\n\nNILSEN: The vehicles we drive play a huge role in addressing climate change.\n\nTransportation emissions account for a little less than a third of total US emissions - the biggest individual sector for greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nEven accounting for mining for the critical minerals needed for EV batteries, EVs are much cleaner than gas-powered vehicles - assuming the power used to charge them is also coming from clean sources.\n\nWOLF: Even before Biden took office, states like California were taking the lead in a more climate-focused energy policy. Would that continue even if Trump wins?\n\nNILSEN: Yes, blue states like California and Washington state and even some Midwestern, purple states like Michigan and Minnesota have passed some very ambitious climate laws through their legislatures. That work will continue in the states even if Trump is elected.\n\nBut given how quickly we're running out of time to get the planet's warming under control, it will be important to have the federal government moving in that direction as well.\n\nWOLF: Better than presidents taking executive action or the Environmental Protection Agency writing a regulation to address the climate would be lawmakers passing a major piece of climate legislation. Are there any indications of movement toward a new national energy policy?\n\nNILSEN: Lawmakers passing the IRA was a huge achievement in its own right; however, multiple lawmakers have said the IRA was just the start.\n\nGiven the 2017 Trump tax cuts are expiring soon, and Congress will have to take up tax policy in 2025, there's already chatter about a possible carbon tax, or a carbon tariff on polluting products like cement and steel, coming up in the legislature.\n\nOf course, what's possible in Congress depends tremendously on which party is in power - and who is in the White House.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

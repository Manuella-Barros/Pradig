This strike led to significant disruptions, with the national electricity grid shut down and operators driven away from a key transmission station, leaving efforts to restore power thwarted.\n\nThroughout the country, government employees either did not report to work or blocked office entrances, affecting airports in Abuja and Lagos.

The strike affects electricity and aviation sectors, with oil unions threatening to halt production. This marks the fourth strike since President Tinubu took office.\n\nNigeria's main labour unions on Monday shut down the national grid and disrupted flights across the country as they began an indefinite strike over the government's failure to agree a new minimum wage. The strike began after talks broke down between the government and the country's two biggest union federations, the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), over increasing the minimum wage. It is the fourth since President Bola Tinubu took office last year.\n\nThe Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said union members drove operators away at the country's power control rooms and shut down at least six substations, eventually shutting the national grid at 02:19 am (0119 GMT). Nigerian airline Ibom Air said it was suspending flights until further notice due to the strike, while another, United Nigeria, said airports across the country had been shut down and striking workers had permitted none of its flights to operate.\n\nElectricity and aviation unions said in a statement on Monday they had directed members to withdraw their services in compliance with the indefinite strike. Oil unions also threatened to halt oil production, but Nigeria's oil regulator chief Gbenga Komolafe said contingencies were in place to ensure output was not disrupted.\n\nSince taking office Tinubu, has embarked on Nigeria's boldest reforms, which has fuelled a rise in inflation to an almost 30-year high and worsened a cost-of-living crisis in Africa's most populous nation. He has been under pressure from unions to offer relief to households and small businesses after scrapping subsidies on petrol, which kept fuel cheap but cost the government $10 billion a year.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to strike a measured and realistic balance in this effort to arrive at a new minimum wage for Nigerians,\" said Information Minister Mohammed Idris, after talks with union leaders reconvened on Monday afternoon. Unions declared the indefinite strike on Friday after talks for a new minimum wage meant to cushion the impact of reforms collapsed. They had demanded a sixteen-fold raise in the minimum wage to 494,000 naira ($333.23) a month from 30,000 naira, and vowed to continue the strike until a new minimum wage was in place.\n\nUnions have also demanded the reversal of an electricity tariff hike effected in April for better-off consumers who use the most power, as the government tries to wean the economy off subsidies. The TCN said it was making efforts to recover and stabilise the national grid, but unions were obstructing grid recovery nationwide.\n\nOn Thursday, Nigeria's privatisation body said the country had secured a World Bank loan of $500 million for its electricity sector.

The striking workers are calling for a higher minimum wage.\n\nTwo of Nigeria's largest trade unions called an indefinite strike starting on Monday, with the walkout already crippling the national electricity grid and air travel.\n\nTalks with the government on a new minimum wage, meant to cushion the impact of inflation of more than 30%, recently broke down.\n\nThe ongoing protest is the fourth large strike staged by the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) since President Bola Tinubu took office last year and launched a far-reaching set of economic reforms.\n\nPower grid goes offline overnight\n\nElectricity and aviation unions had directed their workers to withdraw their services and comply with the strike call, union representatives said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThe national electricity provider, the Transmission Company of Nigeria, said that union members drove away operators at the country's power control rooms and shut down at least six substations overnight.\n\nThis led to a shutdown of the national grid as of 2:19 a.m. local time (0019 GMT/UTC), it said.\n\nNigerian airline Ibom Air said it was suspending flights until further notice, while another, United Nigeria, said airports across the country had been shut down and that striking workers were preventing it from operating.\n\nInflation runs high amid Tinubu's reforms\n\nAfter taking office in May 2023, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu embarked on a bold set of economic reforms, which he argues were necessary and would bear fruit in the future.\n\nBut Tinubu's reforms, coupled with macroeconomic impacts following the COVID pandemic and amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have put additional strain on inflation, which rose to an almost 30-year high of more than 30% this year.\n\nSlowing growth rates and a reduced government tax intake have exacerbated the problems. Already saddled by high debt repayments, Nigeria is currently running an annual budget deficit in the region of 5% of GDP.\n\nTinubu's administration also took the controversial step of scrapping government subsidies on petrol in the oil-rich country.\n\nThese payments kept fuel cheap, but also cost the government roughly $10 billion in 2023. That comfortably outstrips the government's share of revenues from selling oil, even as the world's ninth most prolific exporter.\n\nCritics of fuel subsidies, including environmentalists, argue that the subsidies are ultimately counterproductive. They claim such measures tend to benefit relatively affluent people, rather than the country's poorest, while also reducing governments' spending power in other core areas like education, healthcare, infrastructure and national security.", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trades Union Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibom_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibom Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coordinated Universal Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620377", "eventUri": "eng-9620377", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

the national grid at 02:19 am (0119 GMT).\n\nNigerian airline Ibom Air said it was suspending flights until further notice due to the strike, while another, United Nigeria, said airports across the country had been shut down and striking workers had permitted none of its flights to operate.\n\nElectricity and aviation unions said in a statement on Monday they had directed members to withdraw their services in compliance with the indefinite strike.\n\nThe oil unions also threatened to halt oil production, but Nigeria's oil regulator chief Gbenga Komolafe said contingencies were in place to ensure output was not disrupted by the strike.\n\nHe has been under pressure from unions to offer relief to households and small businesses after scrapping subsidies on petrol, which kept fuel cheap but cost the government $10 billion a year.\n\nThe TCN said it was making effort to recover and stabilise the national grid, but unions were obstructing grid recovery nationwide.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nRead

Cane-swinging union workers were also seen in photos circulating on social media Monday ordering personnel of the country's tax agency out of their offices.\n\nThis strike comes after failed negotiations with the government to raise the federal minimum wage. The unions are also protesting a recent hike in electricity tariffs.\n\nThe unions' demands include raising the minimum wage from 30,000 naira ($22.4) to 494,000 naira ($369.6). Presidential aide Bayo Onanuga dismissed these demands as \"unreasonable,\" in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nThe government had proposed a 100% increase to 60,000 naira ($44.89), which the unions rejected, seeking a 1,547% increase instead, Onanuga added.\n\nDespite being Africa's fourth-largest economy, Nigeria's minimum wage is not among the continent's top ten, lagging far behind countries like Seychelles, where workers receive a minimum wage of $465.4 monthly.\n\nHealth care system disrupted\n\nThe strike has severely affected travel, leaving passengers stranded at major airports in Lagos and Abuja.

Patients and healthcare workers were all in darkness.\"\n\nNigerian Justice Minister Lateef Fagbemi has declared the strike illegal in a letter to the labor unions, calling it \"premature and ineffectual,\" in a statement posted by Onanuga.\n\nThe strike has elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media, with some declaring support, others saying it is detrimental to citizens.\n\n\"I support the strike action by the NLC. 30k or 60k minimum wage in 2024 Nigeria is unsustainable and unacceptable,\" wrote lawyer Festus Ogun in a post on X.\n\n\"The NLC should refrain from actions that punish the common man - the average Nigerian.

Cane-swinging union workers were also seen in photos circulating on social media Monday ordering personnel of the country's tax agency out of their offices.\n\nThis strike comes after failed negotiations with the government to raise the federal minimum wage. The unions are also protesting a recent hike in electricity tariffs.\n\nThe unions' demands include raising the minimum wage from 30,000 naira ($22.4) to 494,000 naira ($369.6). Presidential aide Bayo Onanuga dismissed these demands as \"unreasonable,\" in a post on the social media platform X.\n\nThe government had proposed a 100% increase to 60,000 naira ($44.89), which the unions rejected, seeking a 1,547% increase instead, Onanuga added.\n\nThe strike has severely affected travel, leaving passengers stranded at major airports in Lagos and Abuja. Airport workers confirmed to CNN that all incoming and outgoing flights have been grounded, further compounding the crisis.\n\nHealthcare services have also been severely impacted, a Nigerian doctor Olusina Ajidahun told CNN.\n\n\"I'm worried because the state of the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse,\" he said, adding that his medical facility located in southwest Nigeria was unable to power crucial hospital equipment due to the shutdown of the national grid.\n\n\"Coming in the morning, the emergency (unit) and everywhere was dark. Patients and healthcare workers were all in darkness.\"\n\nNigerian Justice Minister Lateef Fagbemi has declared the strike illegal in a letter to the labor unions, calling it \"premature and ineffectual,\" in a statement posted by Onanuga.\n\nThe strike has elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media, with some declaring support, others saying it is detrimental to citizens.\n\n\"I support the strike action by the NLC. 30k or 60k minimum wage in 2024 Nigeria is unsustainable and unacceptable,\" wrote lawyer Festus Ogun in a post on X.\n\n\"The NLC should refrain from actions that punish the common man - the average Nigerian. Electricity, roads, airports and other critical infrastructure should be left to function as normal,\" argued management consultant Dipo Awojide.\n\nNigeria faces numerous economic challenges, including the devaluation of its currency which has dropped to record lows in recent months, as well as a cost-of-living crisis marked by soaring prices for food, transport, and health care.

Already saddled by high debt repayments, Nigeria is currently running an annual budget deficit in the region of 5% of GDP.\n\nTinubu's administration also took the controversial step of scrapping government subsidies on petrol in the oil-rich country.\n\nThese payments kept fuel cheap, but also cost the government roughly $10 billion in 2023. That comfortably outstrips the government's share of revenues from selling oil, even as the world's ninth most prolific exporter.\n\nCritics of fuel subsidies, including environmentalists, argue that the subsidies are ultimately counterproductive. They claim such measures tend to benefit relatively affluent people, rather than the country's poorest, while also reducing government's spending power in other core areas like education, healthcare, infrastructure and national security.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trades Union Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibom_Air", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibom Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coordinated Universal Time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.dw.com/image/69257150_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620377", "eventUri": "eng-9620377", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

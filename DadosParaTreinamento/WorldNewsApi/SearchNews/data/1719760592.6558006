It also includes private schools Holy Name of Mary College School and Eitz Chaim. The lawsuit was initially launched in March by four of Ontario\u2019s largest school boards, the Toronto District School Board, Toronto Catholic District School Board, Peel District School Board and Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. Toronto-based law firm Neinstein LLP is representing the boards and schools in the lawsuit. \u201cThe lawsuits filed by these boards and schools claim social media products, intentionally designed for compulsive use, have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn and educators within these boards/schools have been left to manage the fallout,\u201d Schools for Social Media Change said. \u201cThe addictive properties of the products designed by social media giants have compromised all students\u2019 ability to learn, disrupted classrooms and created a student population that suffers from increasing mental health harms,\u201d the group said. \u201cAs a result, social media companies have forced school boards to divert significant resources including personnel, hours, funds, and attention to combat the growing crisis caused by their products.\u201d", "summary": "Five Ontario school boards and two private schools have joined a lawsuit that claims social media tech giants Meta, Snapchat and TikTok are disrupting student learning.", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10531229/ontario-school-boards-social-media-lawsuit/", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240409170444-6615b73a995574496b52d3a2jpeg.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:17:56", "author": "Gabby Rodrigues", "authors": ["Gabby Rodrigues"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.118}

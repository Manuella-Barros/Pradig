Wednesday", "body": "CHICAGO (CBS) -- The Chicago Bears are preparing to make a big announcement about their bid for a new stadium on the lakefront.\n\nThe team is planning to hold a press conference with city officials on Wednesday to unveil their plans for a new publicly-owned stadium on the Museum Campus, including additional park space and improved access to the lakefront.\n\nIn March, the Bears announced they were prepared to commit more than $2 billion to help build a new stadium in Chicago, but have yet to say how much public financing they would seek to help build a replacement for Soldier Field.\n\nWednesday's announcement would provide the first look at what the Bears have in mind for a new stadium in Chicago.\n\nAccording to published reports, the Bears plan to build a new domed stadium along the lakefront, while tearing down most of Soldier Field, while preserving the iconic colonnades and war memorial honoring the nation's veterans.\n\nLast year, the Bears finalized the purchase of the 326-acre Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights for $197 million.\n\nThe team had previously said they were planning to develop the site into a $5 billion sports, retail, residential, and entertainment district centered around a domed stadium, but have been unable to reach a deal with local government and school officials on property taxes for the site, and have since turned their focus to staying in Chicago.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson has said any plans the Bears might have for a new lakefront stadium must have a public benefit.\n\n\"That's what I've been pushing,\" Johnson said last month. \"They also recognize that we have a fiduciary responsibility with private and public partnerships to ensure that there's an ultimate benefit as well as not the heavy burden that historically has been the case when it comes to these negotiations.\"\n\nJohnson said any plans for a new Bears lakefront stadium should ensure it can be used 365 days a year, rather than just on days the Bears are playing, in addition to more public green space on the lakefront.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [],

Mayor Brandon Johnson is expected to attend.\n\nThe team has said the plans will encompass a state-of-the-art enclosed stadium that will also feature additional open green space on the Museum Campus, with access to the lakefront.\n\nLast month, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren announced the team would provide more than $2 billion in funding to build a publicly-owned domed stadium and park space along the lakefront.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the Chicago Tribune reported the Bears' plan will ask taxpayers to cover about half the costs to build the new stadium. According to the report, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told the Tribune the plan is estimated to cost $4.6 billion to execute, with $3.2 billion directed toward building the new stadium itself and another $1.4 billion dedicated to infrastructure improvements around and outside the stadium.\n\nSources told the Tribune the Bears plan to put forward $2.3 billion in private capital, which would include some financing coming from the NFL. But the Bears' plan will also ask for $2.3 billion in public financing.\n\nDebates on funding\n\nThat report, along with Wednesday afternoon's press conference at Soldier Field, is sure to spark renewed debates about how much public funding -- if any -- should go toward financing a new Bears stadium.\n\nCity and state officials have repeatedly expressed their reluctance to provide public funding to help a professional sports franchise build a new stadium.\n\n\"There's next to no appetite to fund a new stadium with taxpayer dollars,\" President of the Illinois Senate Don Harmon has said.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker addressed the Bears' plans for a domed lakefront stadium last month, calling them \"a good first step.\"\n\nBut he reiterated his wariness to commit public funding for a stadium project, saying, \"I don't think that should be the highest priority for the state of Illinois.\"\n\nLast week, Mayor Johnson noted that the city's talks with the team seemed to be headed in the right direction.\n\n\"These conversations, particularly with the Bears, have been quite positive. I appreciate the leadership of Kevin Warren,\" the mayor said.\n\nAnother possible roadblock to a new Bears stadium on the lakefront is the advocacy group Friends of the Parks, which has blocked previous development on the lakefront.\n\nThe group has met with the team, but as of earlier this week, there had been no response on the plans.\n\nArlington Heights question\n\nIn addition to concerns over funding, the Arlington Heights question also lingers if the Bears plan to proceed with building a new stadium in Chicago along the lakefront.\n\nThe Bears still own the Arlington Park property in the northwest suburb, formerly the site of Arlington International Racecourse, which the Bears purchased in February 2023 for $197.2 million. Demolition on the racecourse began soon after.\n\nAt the time, it seemed likely the Bears would build a new stadium at Arlington Park.\n\nHowever, the Bears and local school districts in and around Arlington Heights reached an impasse on the valuation of the property, leaving the Bears with a higher property tax burden there than they feel they should have.\n\nThe Village of Arlington Heights released a proposal in late February that would at least lessen the Bears' property tax burden on Arlington Park, presenting the proposal to the team and the school districts.\n\nBut the Bears seem to have moved on from Arlington Park, saying their focus is on the City of Chicago, then announcing their willingness to contribute more than $2 billion in funding toward a domed lakefront stadium.\n\nRecently, the Tribune reported the Bears filed a request with the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board seeking a $7.2 million property tax refund on Arlington Park.\n\nIn response to the news that the Bears would unveil their lakefront stadium plans Wednesday, Arlington Heights Mayor Tom Hayes reiterated that Arlington Heights remains a great location for a new Bears stadium \"if they get a 'no' on the lakefront.\"\n\nDraft excitement\n\nWednesday's unveiling of new stadium plans, and all the components that surround it, come during one of the most crucial and much-anticipated offseason weeks in Bears history, in terms of the team's future on the field.\n\nThe Bears hold two of the top 10 picks in this year's NFL Draft, including the No. 1 overall. The first round is Thursday night in Detroit.\n\nThe Bears are expected to select quarterback Caleb Williams out of USC, one of the best quarterback prospects to enter the draft in years, with the No. 1 pick. That would instantly give the Bears a new face of the franchise.\n\nAdditionally, the Bears possess the No. 9 overall pick in Thursday's first round, which the team could use to to add another top prospect to its offense or defense, or trade to another team to acquire more assets with which to build the roster.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glenn_marshall@wgntv.com", "name": "Glenn Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_johnson@wgntv.com", "name": "Michael Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

I appreciate the leadership of Kevin Warren,\" the mayor said.\n\nAnother possible roadblock to a new Bears stadium on the lakefront is the advocacy group Friends of the Parks, which has blocked previous development on the lakefront.\n\nThe group has met with the team, but as of earlier this week, there had been no response on the plans.\n\nArlington Heights question\n\nIn addition to concerns over funding, the Arlington Heights question also lingers if the Bears plan to proceed with building a new stadium in Chicago along the lakefront.\n\nThe Bears still own the Arlington Park property in the northwest suburb, formerly the site of Arlington International Racecourse, which the Bears purchased in February 2023 for $197.2 million. Demolition on the racecourse began soon after.\n\nAt the time, it seemed likely the Bears would build a new stadium at Arlington Park.\n\nHowever, the Bears and local school districts in and around Arlington Heights reached an impasse on the valuation of the property, leaving the Bears with a higher property tax burden there than they feel they should have.\n\nThe Village of Arlington Heights released a proposal in late February that would at least lessen the Bears' property tax burden on Arlington Park, presenting the proposal to the team and the school districts.\n\nBut the Bears seem to have moved on from Arlington Park, saying their focus is on the City of Chicago, then announcing their willingness to contribute more that $2 billion in funding toward a domed lakefront stadium.\n\nRecently, the Chicago Tribune reported the Bears filed a request with the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board seeking a $7.2 million property tax refund on Arlington Park.\n\nIn response to the news that the Bears would unveil their lakefront stadium plans Wednesday, Arlington Heights Mayor Tom Hayes reiterated that Arlington Heights remains a great location for a new Bears stadium \"if they get a 'no' on the lakefront.\"\n\nDraft excitement\n\nWednesday's unveiling of new stadium plans, and all the components that surround it, come during one of the most crucial and much-anticipated offseason weeks in Bears history, in terms of the team's future on the field.\n\nThe Bears hold two of the top 10 picks in this year's NFL Draft, including the No. 1 overall. The first round is Thursday night in Detroit.\n\nThe Bears are expected to select quarterback Caleb Williams out of USC, one of the best quarterback prospects to enter the draft in years, with the No. 1 pick. That would instantly give the Bears a new face of the franchise.\n\nAdditionally, the Bears possess the No. 9 overall pick in Thursday's first round, which the team could use to to add another top prospect to its offense or defense, or trade to another team to acquire more assets with which to build the roster.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "glenn_marshall@wgntv.com", "name": "Glenn Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_johnson@wgntv.com", "name": "Michael Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mayor Brandon Johnson attended and delivered a speech following opening remarks from Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren.\n\nIncluded in the proposal made public on Wednesday were renderings from Manica Architecture, seen below.\n\nThe team had previously said the plans would encompass a state-of-the-art enclosed stadium that will also feature additional open green space on the Museum Campus, with access to the lakefront.\n\nLast month, Warren announced the team would provide more than $2 billion in funding to build a publicly-owned domed stadium and park space along the lakefront.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, the Chicago Tribune reported the Bears' plan will ask taxpayers to cover about half the costs to build the new stadium. According to the report, sources speaking on condition of anonymity told the Tribune the plan is estimated to cost $4.6 billion to execute, with $3.2 billion directed toward building the new stadium itself and another $1.4 billion dedicated to infrastructure improvements around and outside the stadium.\n\nSources told the Tribune the Bears plan to put forward $2.3 billion in private capital, which would include some financing coming from the NFL.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights.

Warren said the new stadium will allow the Bears to hold more concerts and events and give them a chance to bid on hosting a Super Bowl.\n\nThe goal is to get approval during the current legislative session, with shovels in the ground by the summer of 2025 that could allow a stadium to open by 2028, Warren said.\n\nSports fields and gardens will replace Soldier Field, with the stadium's historic colonnades preserved as a tribute to Chicago's military veterans. The Bears will continue playing at Soldier Field while the new stadium is under construction.\n\n\"This marks a pivotal moment for Chicago as we introduce a visionary project prioritizing the public good,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement. \"The proposed stadium, accompanied by expanded open spaces and recreational facilities, exemplifies my administration's commitment to enhancing the quality of life for all Chicagoans. ... I look forward to the positive impact it will have on our beloved city.\"\n\nThe stadium project will cost $3.2 billion, and Bears ownership will contribute $2 billion toward that proposed cost. Karen Murphy, the Bears executive vice President of stadium development and COO, said the club will apply for a $300 million NFL loan as part of the private investment plan.\n\nJohnson said the project will not result in new taxes on the city's residents.\n\nWhile the capacity for the new stadium will be similar to Soldier Field (65,000 seats), the plan is to include more standing-room-only options.\n\nOther stadium project plans include improving access to the museum campus near the stadium with better infrastructure and adding public restrooms and food and beverage options for park users.\n\nThe Bears last underwent a major renovation on Soldier Field 20 years ago, and previously planned to move the team to the suburbs north of Chicago.\n\nIn September 2021, the Bears signed a purchase agreement to buy a 326-acre plot of Arlington Park racecourse property in Arlington Heights, Ill. The idea was to build a stadium and create a \"mixed-use\" area full of restaurants, bars and hotels that provide the franchise with more revenue. The deal was finalized in February 2023 and the horserace track was demolished.\n\nBut the team turned its attention back to Chicago as arguments over school districts and real estate taxes for the Arlington Park property stalled the project. The Cook County Board of Review recently appraised the land at $125 million. The Bears have argued it should be valued at $60 million, and an appeal by the team is likely.\n\nIn March, Warren made it clear at the NFL owners' meetings that building a new stadium in Chicago on the lakefront was the priority for the team, rather than Arlington Park.\n\nDespite the Bears' $197.2 million purchase of a 326-acre plot of the Arlington Heights property, Warren said at the owners' meeting that the team was focused on bringing a state-of-the-art stadium to Chicago.\n\nBears chairman George McCaskey echoed Warren later in the day.\n\n\"We want what's best for Bears fans and what's best for the community,\" McCaskey said. \"And if that can be done on the museum campus, we'd be thrilled.\n\n\"That area is a jewel of our great city. But it needs better access. And this is an opportunity to provide that and bring out all that the Museum Campus has to offer. And I think if we do it right, it will be great for the museums, great for Bears fans, great for the people of the city of Chicago and great for the region.\"\n\nWarren played a major role in helping the Vikings build U.S. Bank Stadium, a domed venue considered one of the best in the NFL.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together.

Once again, Chicago taxpayers are being told what is good for them. We are told that a new domed stadium on protected lakefront land will make Chicago a great city,\" the group said in response to the announcement. \"We are already a great city -- in large part due to our protected lakefront. As is so often the case in Chicago, the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront.\"\n\nThe group noted several lingering questions following the team's proposal reveal, including why the team is pushing for a faster timeline on the project, why other parks weren't vetted or chosen as the potential site, what will happen to Soldier Field and more.\n\n\"We did not hear anything at the Bears news conference that could not take place at another Chicago location. We have too many questions to make any decision about the value of these plans. We encourage the Bears and the administration to act with 'honor, integrity, transparency, wisdom and to be forward thinking and collaborative' and not repeat past mistakes,\" the group's statement read.\n\nThe Bears addressed some of those questions during their announcement Wednesday, saying the team evaluated 10-12 different sites before settling on Museum Campus.\n\nAmong those was the Michael Reese Hospital site.\n\n\"I was passionate about the Michael Reese site, one because the history and tradition with Bronzeville and all the different things that it brings to the table,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said. \"The difficulty about this site - it is very narrow. So from an NFL stadium footprint standpoint, it's difficulty doesn't work. It's too narrow. The other thing is that it would require this to be built over an active railroad and train lines. There are certain rules and requirements that the majority of sports leagues, especialls the National Football League, has in regards to building active stadiums over active train lines, especially with a certain kid of 100-foot perimeter.\"\n\nWarren said in order for the team to be able to build a stadium capable of hosting Final Four games, Super Bowls, college playoffs, concerts and more, \"it would be incredibly challenging at this point in time to make that work.\"\n\nThe team revealed plans for more than just a stadium, rather showcasing an entertainment hub that can host a number of major events.\n\n\"This really becomes an international destination [for] the Olympics, World Cup,\" Warren said.\n\nRenderings of the proposed new stadium include a \"fixed\" roof, with the stadium situated atop the current South parking lot of Soldier Field. As for Soldier Field, the columns exist, but the stadium is gone. (See the full renderings here)\n\nThe proposal offers the first chance for fans and the city to view what the team has planned since shifting gears away from the Arlington Heights property they previously purchased.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson spoke to NBC Sports Chicago shortly after the Friends of the Parks statement was released, and he said he's \"looking forward to the continued the conversation.\"\n\n\"The lakefront protected ordinance, which I'm fully in support of, I'm confident we're not in opposition to that ordinance,\" Johnson said. \"We're talking about 20% more open space. The amount of investment going into creating 14 more acres of space for our children, our young people in Chicago to benefit from, that's been the vision for the lakefront for some time. Look, I know there's been a regular practice in the city of Chicago where things have just been rammed down peoples' throats. This is a proposal. What we're saying is, we have an opportunity to not just keep the Bears in the city of Chicago, but 24,000 more construction jobs just for the people of Chicago, 46,000 more jobs in the region, millions of dollars of labor income - the type of income that's needed to afford to live in the city of Chicago. That's what this proposal provides.\"\n\nAmong the new features highlighted by the team were:\n\nOne of the biggest question from residents involved financing for the new plan.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said during the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nBears COO and executive vice president of stadium development Karen Murphy said in a presentation on Wednesday that the team expects the entire stadium project to cost $4.7 billion: $3.2 for the stadium itself and just over $300 million for the infrastructure required to open it, then $1.2 billion for two other phases of development.\n\nLast month, the team confirmed it would contribute $2 billion dollars to fund the majority of the project. On Wednesday, a slide in the presentation clarified that number would be closer to $2.025 billion dollars. After that, the team would look to an NFL stadium program for a $300 million loan. That leaves a $900 million gap for the stadium financing itself. The Bears plan has them looking to a bond mechanism in the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority program to make up the difference.\n\nThe Bears said a 2% hotel tax that is already in place for the ISFA should be able to make up the $900 million they need from public funds.\n\nThere wasn't a clear answer as to where the team would get the $300 million for the infrastructure, however. Murphy said the team is still working with the state and looking into different funding sources.\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money.\n\nThe Bears' plans have also faced increased scrutiny amid a separate push from the Chicago White Sox to secure public funding for a stadium project in the South Loop. According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nWarren and the Bears have said they are still happy to own the Arlington Park property, and officials there remain optimistic that the team could return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nArlington Heights officials said they will be ready and waiting for if the Bears change their minds.\n\n\"There's a lot of challenges ahead with respect to the lakefront stadium in terms of financing and opposition by interest groups like Friends of the Parks... We stand ready to continue discussions with the Bears if they do get a no on the lakefront,\" Mayor Tom Hayes told NBC Chicago.\n\nHe added that while the village is respectful of the Bears' plan to explore a lakefront stadium, they believe the Arlington Heights property is a better fit.\n\n\"Other than a lake which we don't have in Arlington heights, I think everything else in Arlington heights is a better solution for them,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and also could include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases, and construction would take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's 1909 \"Plan of Chicago.\" Johnson said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nAlthough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields and park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and a plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal, and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nJohnson, however, said that the financing for the project will not implement \"any new taxes on the residents of the city of Chicago.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders also were doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail, and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million over a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nBy staying in Chicago, the Bears would remain tenants rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project - especially one on public land - must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property - all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota - why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report. ___", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_seligman@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Andrew Seligman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Burnham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters today at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Burnham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

However, plans for a $5 billion stadium complex on that 326-acre site have stalled after the team wasn't able to reach an agreement over property taxes with local schools in the area.\n\nJohnson has made it clear he wants to keep the team in the city, but the Bears' plan is certain to meet political resistance. Gov. JB Pritzker has said he's willing to consider the Bears' plans, but has voiced reluctance to provide public funding for the project, and state lawmakers also have been reluctant to support taxpayer financing for the Bears.\n\nThe nonprofit group Friends of the Parks also has opposed building a new Bears stadium on the lakefront, citing the city's Lakefront Protection Ordinance, which prohibits further private development east of DuSable Lake Shore Drive.\n\nIn 2016, the Friends of the Parks went to court to block filmmaker George Lucas' plan to build a museum on the same site the Bears are now targeting for a new stadium.

According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nThe Bears have pledged up to $2 billion in private funding for a stadium, but have not announced other financing details ahead of Wednesday's press conference.\n\nBears President Kevin Warren recently discussed the change of direction in the team's plans during media availabilities at the NFL league meetings in Orlando.\n\nWarren's 30-minute sit-down with the Chicago media mainly focused on the Bears' efforts to build a new stadium on the lakefront, as opposed to the Arlington Heights location.\n\nListen to Kevin Warren's full press conference\n\nWhen asked about the Bears' pivot to the lakefront and the steam their plan is gaining, Warren noted there is still a long way to go, but he believes things are moving in the right direction.\n\n\"All of these projects are, you know, that's a great word. They require momentum. They require vision,\" Warren said. \"They require tenacity. They require a lot of thought and planning, but they also require momentum. And I strongly believe that we're building momentum to that museum area.\n\n\"So when you have that combination of the museum, the lakefront, the beach, the architecture, and most of all, what makes Chicago special is the people. And so when you can mix that together, you do get great momentum, but it's going to require a lot of work as we proceed forward.\"\n\nWarren and the Bears are happy to own the Arlington Park property, but their sights are set on downtown.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nWarren doesn't view the change of focus as a waste of the Bears' initial investment in the Arlington Park property.\n\n\"I think one of the things that I would say, and especially in my position, is I always have to live in a world of prioritization,\" Warren said. \"So it's good to own land. And at the appropriate time, we'll address what is the best use of that land. But for now, the energy and the efforts of our individuals internally, with our consultants and ownership, is focused on Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bears must overcome several obstacles to make the domed stadium on the lakefront a reality.\n\nThe first is ensuring a healthy, long-term relationship between the team and the park district. Given their rocky history, that bridge might be harder to cross than it sounds.\n\n\"I believe in people, I believe in relationships,\" Warren said about the park district-team relationship. \"And even since I've been able to be here and spend time with individuals at Soldier Field, individuals at the park district, individuals in the city of Chicago, I've only been welcomed. And we've had a great relationship. And I think people have seen that. They feel it. And I'm just confident that when you have a common goal that people can focus on and come together, I'm confident that we'll have a positive relationship as we go forward. And so one of the things I promised myself when I started on April 17 of last year was that I was going to understand and appreciate and embrace the history of the Chicago Bears and all the relationships. But any tension or negativity, I was not going to take it forward.\n\n\"And so I started from scratch. And I feel that we have not only great from a business relationship, but we've developed a personal relationship. And we work together very well. So I'm pleased with the way that it's gone. And I look forward to even building stronger relationships in the future. So that's an area that's not really a concern of mine.\"\n\nAs far as the thought that the lakefront project would require more than $1 billion in public infrastructure investment, Warren views the investment, whatever the number is, as good for the city of Chicago as it looks to compete against other cities in the marketplace.\n\n\"Those are things that we're working on. And one thing that I can guarantee you, I am fiscally conservative, and I am financially responsible,\" Warren said when asked about public funding. \"So anything that we recommend, from a financial standpoint, will be very well thought out.\"\n\nWarren cited a Sports Business Journal article that did not have Chicago in \"Top 25 Sports Business Cities\" as evidence that the investment is needed.\n\n\"But to think Chicago, you know, with this massive background, all the professional sports teams we have, the beautiful landscape, the topography, all those things involved, known for an incredible sports city.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report. ___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_seligman@register-herald.com", "name": "Andrew Seligman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Burnham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

On Wednesday, the Bears released the initial designs for a new lakefront stadium. According to Front Office Sports, the stadium is projected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. The Bears said they will pledge $2 billion toward the effort.\n\nThe stadium will be located just south of Soldier Field and will be enclosed. The release of the designs comes after the team announced last month it plans to stay in the city of Chicago after considering multiple options across the area suburbs.\n\n\"The future stadium of the Chicago Bears will bring a transformative opportunity to our region -- boosting the economy, creating jobs, facilitating mega events, and generating millions in tax revenue,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said in March, per Front Office Sports. \"We look forward to sharing more information when our plans are finalized.\"\n\nOne thing to note about the proposed staidum is there is not deal in place with the city of the Chicago and the state of Illinois when it comes to the remaining funding. \"If we're going to build 21st-century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire city of Chicago, and these conversations, particularly with the Bears, have been quite positive,\" Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson said last week. \"I appreciate the leadership of [team president] Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nThe Bears have been playing at Soldier Field since 1971. There have been renovations made to the stadium over the years, but Chicago is looking to host big sporting events like the Super Bowl and the Final Four, meaning a new stadium is the best and easiest way to do that.\n\nIn 2022, the Bears penned an open letter that showed conceptual plans for development of the 326-acre property on Arlington Park, which located in the Chicago suburb Arlington Heights.\n\n\"If the team does proceed with the purchase of the Arlington Park property, and if the Bears organization then chooses to proceed with the development of the property, the project will be one of the largest development projects in Illinois state history,\" the Bears wrote in the letter. \"We envision a multi-purpose entertainment district anchored by a new, best-in-class enclosed stadium, providing Chicagoland with a new home worthy of hosting global events such as the Super Bowl, College Football Playoffs, and Final Four.\"\n\nThe Bears are coming off a 2023 season where they finished 7-10.

Rogal, Chicago Tribune The Tribune Content Agency\n\nCHICAGO - The Chicago Bears are set to announce a $4.6 billion plan for a new enclosed stadium and lakefront area, half of which would come from taxpayers, sources said, but the team will have to overcome serious skepticism from several directions.\n\nThe stadium itself would cost $3.2 billion to build, with another $1.4 billion in proposed infrastructure improvements, according to sources familiar with the plan who spoke to the Chicago Tribune on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe sources said the Bears plan to pledge $2.3 billion, which include some financing through the NFL. But the Bears' plan includes an additional $2.3 billion in public financing, along with refinancing outstanding debt for prior publicly financed stadium projects for the Bears and White Sox, according to the sources.\n\nTaxpayers would be on the hook for the proposed infrastructure improvements along with about $1 billion in new borrowing to finance the new stadium south of Soldier Field, the sources said.\n\nTo make the plan a reality, the Bears want the Illinois General Assembly to approve $1.5 billion in new bonding for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which carries the debt for prior projects at Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, sources said.\n\nAbout one-third of the new borrowing would be used to roll over existing stadium debt, and the plan calls for the new borrowing to be paid off over 40 years, which also would require legislative approval.\n\nSources said the Bears' plan calls for the debt to be repaid without raising the 2% hotel tax that currently goes to ISFA.\n\nThe details are expected to be revealed at a much-anticipated news conference at noon Wednesday where officials will lay out plans for the domed stadium with increased open space.\n\nThe 2% hotel tax has fallen far short of paying off the existing debt. As a result, taxpayers still owe $629 million for past renovations of Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, whose occupants, the White Sox, also are seeking a new stadium in the South Loop. To finance a new Bears stadium using the hotel tax, the state would have to increase the borrowing limit for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority.\n\nThat could prove to be a tough sell in Springfield, however, where legislative leaders so far have given the Bears, and the Sox, a cool reception.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the Bears can legally build on the site. The city's lakefront protection ordinance calls for public use of the lakefront, and the team has called for public ownership of the stadium.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Parks opposes building a stadium for a privately owned team on the lakefront. The group successfully drove \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas away from plans to build a movie art museum on the same site, now used for parking lots.\n\nWhatever the Bears propose, they will have to win over skeptics, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who a spokesperson said Tuesday had not been briefed by the team about the stadium plans. The governor had previously called the Bears' proposed investment \"a good first step,\" and said he's willing to listen to their proposal, but said it shouldn't be a priority for the state.\n\nJoe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog group, told the Tribune in a recent interview that the Bears and Sox need to show vetted cost and revenue projections.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in the city) - the question is, on what terms?\" he said. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) actually is viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"\n\nThe city recently went through a similar scenario, he said, when it chose the Bally's casino for development, only to find the project is already being scaled back and has funding issues.\n\n\"I think Gov. Pritzker has spoken to this exactly right, with a real wariness about public funding of sports stadiums,\" Ferguson said. \"We need to see reliable, thorough revenue projections for this before we can even open the conversation.\"\n\nMaking the situation more precarious, Ferguson said, is that all levels of government are facing financial cliffs in multiple areas - pensions, transit and Chicago Public Schools -with the end of billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 pandemic money.\n\nSports economist J.C. Bradbury, voicing a common concern among economists, said whatever public money is earmarked for the stadium would be better spent on other public projects, or returned to taxpayers.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\" Bradbury said. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nThe team has taken a long, strange trip to get to this point. In 2022, officials agreed to buy the former Arlington International Racecourse for $197 million, closing on the deal last year. Under prior President and CEO Ted Phillips, the team made an elaborate presentation of its plans for a $5 billion mixed-used development on the 326-acre site, with an enclosed stadium, housing and entertainment.\n\nBut since Kevin Warren became team president and CEO last year, the team has been unable to reach agreement over property taxes with local schools in the Arlington Heights area.\n\nAs the Minnesota Vikings did when Warren was an executive there, the Bears reversed course from a suburban stadium site to downtown. Warren has extolled the beauty and energy of the city, talked of his rapport with Mayor Brandon Johnson, and has said the lakefront is the \"ideal location.\"\n\n\"Absolutely we can build something that would be magnificent downtown,\" he said.\n\nThe team wouldn't necessarily have to move right away, with a lease at Soldier Field through 2033. But Warren has talked about the importance of momentum in getting the stadium project done. State lawmakers are scheduled to meet until May 24, then have a veto session in the fall, and a brief lame-duck session in the new year.\n\nReconstructing the museum campus around a new Bears stadium could help attract new residential and retail development along the lakefront, replacing some of the tax revenue lost by the declining property values of downtown office towers, said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head of the Chicago region for Savills, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nIf the Bears' proposal improves lakefront access with better public transportation with new gathering spaces, it's possible the new stadium district will attract families year-round, not just on a handful of Sundays.\n\nFeinberg said he still doesn't understand why the Bears didn't settle disagreements with Arlington Heights' officials before buying the former Churchill Downs site.\n\n\"It seems so strange they would plop down all this money, and then say this is just not working out for us,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind.\"\n\nIf the Bears do cut a deal for a lakefront stadium, it would leave Arlington Heights with a big hole to fill, said John Melaniphy of Melaniphy & Associates, a former business and development coordinator for the village of Arlington Heights. But even without football, the former racetrack site could still attract mixed-use developments with apartments, restaurants and entertainment.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_gorner@bradenton.com", "name": "Jeremy Gorner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson returns to his seat after speaking at the unveiling in Chicago on April 23, 2024. The Chicago Bears unveiled a nearly $5 billion proposal Wednesday for an enclosed stadium next door to their current home at Soldier Field as part of a major project that would transform the city's lakefront, and they are asking for public funding to help make it happen. The plan calls for $3.2 billion for the new stadium plus an additional $1.5 billion in infrastructure. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team\u00b4s lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears\u00b4 stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago\u00b4s famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field\u00b4s famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project - especially one on public land - must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn\u00b4t on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it\u00b4s a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I\u00b4m not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois\u00b4 top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings\u00b4 front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property - all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together.

The Bears said they will also announce plans for green and open space along the lakefront, with preserved access to the shoreline for families on the Museum Campus, according to the release.\n\nThe press conference will be streamed live in the player above once it begins.\n\nAccording to a report from the Chicago Tribune, the stadium would cost approximately $4.6 billion to build, with taxpayers financing roughly half of the cost.\n\nAfter purchasing land in suburban Arlington Heights for a proposed domed stadium, the team recently changed course and committed to building in Chicago, setting their sights on a \"publicly-owned\" stadium on the city's lakefront, located near their current home at Soldier Field.\n\nThe move could be seen as an attempt to ease concerns from preservation group Friends of the Parks, which successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront and has previously voiced opposition to the construction of any new stadium project on Museum Campus.\n\nFriends of the Parks declined comment ahead of the Bears' announced press conference.\n\nThe Bears' plans have also faced increased scrutiny amid a separate push from the Chicago White Sox to secure public funding for a stadium project in the South Loop. According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nThe Bears have pledged up to $2 billion in private funding for a stadium, but have not announced other financing details ahead of Wednesday's press conference.\n\nThe Bears must overcome several obstacles to make the domed stadium on the lakefront a reality.\n\nThe first is ensuring a healthy, long-term relationship between the team and the park district. Given their rocky history, that bridge might be harder to cross than it sounds.\n\n\"I believe in people, I believe in relationships,\" Warren said about the park district-team relationship. \"And even since I've been able to be here and spend time with individuals at Soldier Field, individuals at the park district, individuals in the city of Chicago, I've only been welcomed. And we've had a great relationship. And I think people have seen that. They feel it. And I'm just confident that when you have a common goal that people can focus on and come together, I'm confident that we'll have a positive relationship as we go forward. And so one of the things I promised myself when I started on April 17 of last year was that I was going to understand and appreciate and embrace the history of the Chicago Bears and all the relationships. But any tension or negativity, I was not going to take it forward.\n\nMORE: Bears' new stadium plan raises funding questions as taxpayers still owe $589M on Soldier Field\n\n\"And so I started from scratch. And I feel that we have not only great from a business relationship, but we've developed a personal relationship. And we work together very well. So I'm pleased with the way that it's gone. And I look forward to even building stronger relationships in the future. So that's an area that's not really a concern of mine.\"\n\nAs far as the thought that the lakefront project would require more than $1 billion in public infrastructure investment, Warren views the investment, whatever the number is, as good for the city of Chicago as it looks to compete against other cities in the marketplace.\n\n\"Those are things that we're working on. And one thing that I can guarantee you, I am fiscally conservative, and I am financially responsible,\" Warren said when asked about public funding. \"So anything that we recommend, from a financial standpoint, will be very well thought out.\"\n\nWarren cited a Sports Business Journal article that did not have Chicago in \"Top 25 Sports Business Cities\" as evidence that the investment is needed.\n\n\"But to think Chicago, you know, with this massive background, all the professional sports teams we have, the beautiful landscape, the topography, all those things involved, known for an incredible sports city. For us not to be on that list, from a business standpoint, those are the things that as a citizen of downtown Chicago and the state of Illinois, those are things from a business standpoint, concern me I look forward to the day that events like [the NFL league meetings] should and can be and will be held in downtown Chicago.\"\n\nBears President Kevin Warren recently discussed the change of direction in the team's plans during media availabilities at the NFL league meetings in Orlando.\n\nWhen asked about the Bears' pivot to the lakefront and the steam their plan is gaining, Warren noted there is still a long way to go, but he believes things are moving in the right direction.\n\n\"All of these projects are, you know, that's a great word. They require momentum. They require vision,\" Warren said. \"They require tenacity. They require a lot of thought and planning, but they also require momentum. And I strongly believe that we're building momentum to that museum area.\n\n\"So when you have that combination of the museum, the lakefront, the beach, the architecture, and most of all, what makes Chicago special is the people. And so when you can mix that together, you do get great momentum, but it's going to require a lot of work as we proceed forward.\"\n\nWarren and the Bears are happy to own the Arlington Park property, but their sights are set on downtown.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Parks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

Construction would begin in summer 2025.\n\n\"The Bears have been proud to call Chicago home for more than 100 years. Perhaps no other sports team embodies the character of the city it represents better than the Bears and Chicago,\" said chairman George H. McCaskey. \"Our founder, George Halas, emphasized the importance of being a champion for Chicago. This has been part of the foundation of our organization. That is why we are excited to invest in the greatest city in the world through a stadium project and site improvements that will benefit Chicagoans and visitors.\"\n\nThe new stadium would feature a translucent roof and large window with view of Chicago's skyline, similar to features seen at Sofi Stadium in Inglewood or U.S. Bank in Minnesota, but Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the team said.\n\nThe Bears have committed $2 billion toward the project, but would need additional funding in the form of a $300 million loan from the NFL Stadium program and $900 million from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which involve extending bonds of an existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nIn addition to NFL games, it would host events like concerts year-round and be an option for Super Bowls, college basketball's Final Four and soccer.\n\nOfficials say the stadium project would create 43,000 construction jobs and have an $8.4 billion impact during construction. Once built it would create 4,000 permanent jobs and an ongoing $455 million economic impact, officials said.\n\n\"This is a beautiful day for the city of Chicago. It really is,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said. \"As a lifelong Bears fan, it is an honor to be here to celebrate the Bears commitment to remaining the Chicago Bears. Any new development project on the lakefront has to have real private investment, real public use and real economic participation for the entire city. Today's announcement delivers on all three.\"\n\nThere remains some notable skeptics of the proposal, though. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who was not present at the press conference, said Wednesday that he doesn't see why taxpayers should foot the bill for a significant portion of the project.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal, and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said, via the Chicago Tribune. \"There are a lot of priorities that the state has, and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders also expressed doubt.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said, according to the Associated Press. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nThe Bears have called Soldier Field home since 1971, but it is the smallest stadium in the NFL, with a capacity of 61,500.

Reports say taxpayers would be on the hook for the rest\n\nA day before the NFL Draft is set to begin, the Chicago Bears, \"in collaboration with city officials and stakeholders,\" are scheduled Wednesday to announce plans for a new, \"state-of-the-art, publicly owned enclosed stadium\" along the city's lakefront, the team said in a press release.\n\nThe Bears said they will also announce plans for green and open space along the lakefront, with preserved access to the shoreline for families on the Museum Campus, according to the release.\n\nAccording to a report from the Chicago Tribune, the stadium would cost approximately $4.6 billion to build, with taxpayers financing roughly half of the cost.\n\nThe announcement will take place at 12 p.m. Wednesday at the Bears' current home, Soldier Field. It will be streamed in the player above once it begins.\n\nAfter purchasing land in suburban Arlington Heights for a proposed domed stadium, the team recently changed course and committed to building in Chicago, setting their sights on a \"publicly-owned\" stadium on the city's lakefront, located near their current home at Soldier Field.\n\nThe move could be seen as an attempt to ease concerns from preservation group Friends of the Parks, which successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront and has previously voiced opposition to the construction of any new stadium project on Museum Campus.\n\nFriends of the Parks declined comment ahead of the Bears' announced press conference.\n\nThe Bears' plans have also faced increased scrutiny amid a separate push from the Chicago White Sox to secure public funding for a stadium project in the South Loop. According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nThe Bears have pledged up to $2 billion in private funding for a stadium, but have not announced other financing details ahead of Wednesday's press conference.\n\nBears President Kevin Warren recently discussed the change of direction in the team's plans during media availabilities at the NFL league meetings in Orlando.\n\nWhen asked about the Bears' pivot to the lakefront and the steam their plan is gaining, Warren noted there is still a long way to go, but he believes things are moving in the right direction.\n\n\"All of these projects are, you know, that's a great word. They require momentum. They require vision,\" Warren said. \"They require tenacity. They require a lot of thought and planning, but they also require momentum. And I strongly believe that we're building momentum to that museum area.\n\n\"So when you have that combination of the museum, the lakefront, the beach, the architecture, and most of all, what makes Chicago special is the people. And so when you can mix that together, you do get great momentum, but it's going to require a lot of work as we proceed forward.\"\n\nWarren and the Bears are happy to own the Arlington Park property, but their sights are set on downtown.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nThe Bears must overcome several obstacles to make the domed stadium on the lakefront a reality.\n\nThe first is ensuring a healthy, long-term relationship between the team and the park district. Given their rocky history, that bridge might be harder to cross than it sounds.\n\n\"I believe in people, I believe in relationships,\" Warren said about the park district-team relationship. \"And even since I've been able to be here and spend time with individuals at Soldier Field, individuals at the park district, individuals in the city of Chicago, I've only been welcomed. And we've had a great relationship. And I think people have seen that. They feel it. And I'm just confident that when you have a common goal that people can focus on and come together, I'm confident that we'll have a positive relationship as we go forward. And so one of the things I promised myself when I started on April 17 of last year was that I was going to understand and appreciate and embrace the history of the Chicago Bears and all the relationships. But any tension or negativity, I was not going to take it forward.\n\nMORE: Bears' new stadium plan raises funding questions as taxpayers still owe $589M on Soldier Field\n\n\"And so I started from scratch. And I feel that we have not only great from a business relationship, but we've developed a personal relationship. And we work together very well. So I'm pleased with the way that it's gone. And I look forward to even building stronger relationships in the future. So that's an area that's not really a concern of mine.\"\n\nAs far as the thought that the lakefront project would require more than $1 billion in public infrastructure investment, Warren views the investment, whatever the number is, as good for the city of Chicago as it looks to compete against other cities in the marketplace.\n\n\"Those are things that we're working on. And one thing that I can guarantee you, I am fiscally conservative, and I am financially responsible,\" Warren said when asked about public funding. \"So anything that we recommend, from a financial standpoint, will be very well thought out.\"\n\nWarren cited a Sports Business Journal article that did not have Chicago in \"Top 25 Sports Business Cities\" as evidence that the investment is needed.\n\n\"But to think Chicago, you know, with this massive background, all the professional sports teams we have, the beautiful landscape, the topography, all those things involved, known for an incredible sports city. For us not to be on that list, from a business standpoint, those are the things that as a citizen of downtown Chicago and the state of Illinois, those are things from a business standpoint, concern me I look forward to the day that events like [the NFL league meetings] should and can be and will be held in downtown Chicago.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Parks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

The Bears said they'd provide over $2 billion for the project, which they said would cover over 70% of the costs. But projections put the total price tag at around $4.7 billion.\n\nThe Bears said the project would create 43,000 temporary construction jobs and generate $8 billion in economic impact. Such economic impact numbers provided by other major professional sports teams have been challenged and often debunked in other regions of the country.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was on hand with the Bears for the announcement and said the stadium complex could host numerous events.\n\n\"Including Chicago Public School championships, graduations, major concerts, the Final Four, Big Ten Championship, my next inauguration, I don't know, we will just keep adding to it,\" said Johnson.\n\nRevealed at a news conference Wednesday, the Chicago Bears show a promotional video, feature Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, and details about the cost of a proposed stadium.

The 100-year-old stadium would be torn down to make way.\n\nAt a much-anticipated news conference at noon Wedneday, officials are expected to lay out plans for a stadium with increased open space and improved access and with potential add-ons that could include a hotel and sports museum.\n\nThe team must answer two crucial questions: who would pay for the rest of the project, and how? Sports consultant Marc Ganis has estimated stadium construction costs at $2.5 billion to $3 billion, plus an estimated $1 billion in associated infrastructure.\n\nThe team has discussed extending the current 2% city hotel tax that is committed to pay for past renovations at Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, the White Sox ballpark. The Sox also are looking for help to build a new stadium in the South Loop.\n\nBut the hotel tax has fallen far short of paying off the existing debt. As a result, taxpayers still owe $629 million for past renovations of Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the Bears can legally build on the site. The city's Lakefront Protection ordinance calls for public use of the lakefront, and the team has called for public ownership of the stadium.\n\nThe non-profit Friends of the Parks opposes building a new stadium for a privately owned team on the lakefront. The group successfully drove \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas away from plans to build a movie art museum on the same site, now used for parking lots.\n\nWhatever the Bears propose, they will have to win over skeptics, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The governor called the Bears' proposed investment \"a good first step,\" and said he's willing to listen to their proposal, but said it shouldn't be a priority for the state.\n\nJoe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog group, told the Tribune in a recent interview that the Bears and Sox need to show vetted cost and revenue projections.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in the city) -- the question is, on what terms?\" he said. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) actually is viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"\n\nThe city recently went through a similar scenario, he said, when it chose the Bally's casino for development, only to find the project is already being scaled back and has funding issues.\n\n\"I think Gov. Pritzker has spoken to this exactly right, with a real wariness about public funding of sports stadiums,\" Ferguson said. \"We need to see reliable, thorough revenue projections for this before we can even open the conversation.\"\n\nMaking the situation more precarious, Ferguson said, is that all levels of government are facing financial cliffs in multiple areas -- pensions, transit, and Chicago Public Schools, with the end of billions of dollars in federal COVID pandemic money.\n\nThe Bears are offering a $2 billion as a big incentive to do business with them. But if the city pays $1 billion toward the plan, sports economist J.C. Bradbury said, voicing a common concern among economists, that's $1 billion that would be better spent on other public projects, or returned to taxpayers.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me,\" Bradbury said. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nThe team has taken a long, strange trip to get to this point. In 2022, officials agreed to buy the former Arlington International Racecourse for $197 million, closing on the deal last year. Under prior president and CEO Ted Phillips, the team made an elaborate presentation of its plans for a $5 billion mixed-used development on the 326-acre site, with an enclosed stadium, housing and entertainment.\n\nBut since Kevin Warren became team president and CEO last year, the team has been unable to reach agreement over property taxes with local schools in the Arlington Heights area.\n\nAs the Minnesota Vikings did when Warren was an executive there, the Bears reversed course from a suburban stadium site to downtown. Warren has extolled the beauty and energy of the city, talked of his rapport with Mayor Brandon Johnson, and has said the lakefront is the \"ideal location.\"\n\n\"Absolutely we can build something that would be magnificent downtown,\" he said.\n\nThe team wouldn't necessarily have to move right away, with a lease at Soldier Field through 2033. But Warren has talked about the importance of momentum in getting the stadium project done. State lawmakers are scheduled to meet until May 24, then have a veto session in the fall, and a brief lame-duck session in the new year.\n\nReconstructing the museum campus around a new Bears stadium could help attract new residential and retail development along the lakefront, replacing some of the tax revenue lost by the declining property values of downtown office towers, said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head of the Chicago region for Savills, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nIf the Bears' proposal improves lakefront access with better public transportation with new gathering spaces, it's possible the new stadium district will attract families year-round, not just on a handful of Sundays.\n\nFeinberg said he still doesn't understand why the Bears didn't settle disagreements with Arlington Heights' officials before buying the former Churchill Downs site.\n\n\"It seems so strange they would plop down all this money, and then say this is just not working out for us,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind.\"\n\nIf the Bears do cut a deal for a lakefront stadium, it would leave Arlington Heights with a big hole to fill, said John Melaniphy of Melaniphy & Associates, a former business and development coordinator for the village of Arlington Heights. But even without football, the former racetrack site could still attract mixed-use developments with apartments, restaurants and entertainment.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_mccoppin@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Robert McCoppin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brian_j_rogal@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Brian J.

The team is set to announce plans for a new lakefront stadium on Wednesday, and details about the project have started to surface.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, the Bears' plan to build a new stadium will cost approximately $4.6 billion, with half of that coming from taxpayers. The actual enclosed stadium would cost around $3.2 billion, and the other $1.4 billion would be used for improvements to the infrastructure. All of this and more is expected to be announced at noon CT on Wednesday during a press conference with the Bears and the city of Chicago.\n\nWhile the plans may be getting underway, the Bears may have a hard time pulling this off for a number of reasons. They will need to get state officials on board with the plan, and they haven't shown much interest in either the Bears or the White Sox, who are also requesting money for a new Chicago stadium. It's worth noting that Chicago taxpayers are still on the hook for approximately $629 million for the Soldier Field renovations and the building of Guaranteed Rate Field back in the early 2000s. The Bears will also need to win over the \"Friends of the Park\" nonprofit organization, which has already come out against building a new stadium just south of Soldier Field.\n\nThese impending plans are the latest pivot in the never-ending stadium saga that began with the Bears entering into an agreement to purchase 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights nearly three years ago. Since then, the twists and turns, including the change in leadership from Ted Phillips to Kevin Warren, have landed the team back in a position where they're looking to stay in the city.\n\nWednesday's press conference will hopefully answer plenty of questions. The $3.2 billion price tag for the stadium alone certainly raises eyebrows, though. It would be the second-most expensive NFL stadium in the country, according to Rob Schwarz Jr. of Bear Goggles On. As for the $2.3 billion taxpayers would owe, fans and residents of Chicago aren't loving the idea.", "source": {"uri": "bearswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bears Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_sugrue@bearswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Brendan Sugrue", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bearswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2024/02/1672282412.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused.

We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nWarren doesn't view the change of focus as a waste of the Bears' initial investment in the Arlington Park property.\n\n\"I think one of the things that I would say, and especially in my position, is I always have to live in a world of prioritization,\" Warren said. \"So it's good to own land. And at the appropriate time, we'll address what is the best use of that land. But for now, the energy and the efforts of our individuals internally, with our consultants and ownership, is focused on Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bears must overcome several obstacles to make the domed stadium on the lakefront a reality.\n\nThe first is ensuring a healthy, long-term relationship between the team and the park district. Given their rocky history, that bridge might be harder to cross than it sounds.\n\n\"I believe in people, I believe in relationships,\" Warren said about the park district-team relationship. \"And even since I've been able to be here and spend time with individuals at Soldier Field, individuals at the park district, individuals in the city of Chicago, I've only been welcomed. And we've had a great relationship. And I think people have seen that. They feel it. And I'm just confident that when you have a common goal that people can focus on and come together, I'm confident that we'll have a positive relationship as we go forward. And so one of the things I promised myself when I started on April 17 of last year was that I was going to understand and appreciate and embrace the history of the Chicago Bears and all the relationships. But any tension or negativity, I was not going to take it forward.\n\n\"And so I started from scratch. And I feel that we have not only great from a business relationship, but we've developed a personal relationship. And we work together very well. So I'm pleased with the way that it's gone. And I look forward to even building stronger relationships in the future. So that's an area that's not really a concern of mine.\"\n\nAs far as the thought that the lakefront project would require more than $1 billion in public infrastructure investment, Warren views the investment, whatever the number is, as good for the city of Chicago as it looks to compete against other cities in the marketplace.\n\n\"Those are things that we're working on. And one thing that I can guarantee you, I am fiscally conservative, and I am financially responsible,\" Warren said when asked about public funding. \"So anything that we recommend, from a financial standpoint, will be very well thought out.\"\n\nWarren cited a Sports Business Journal article that did not have Chicago in \"Top 25 Sports Business Cities\" as evidence that the investment is needed.\n\n\"But to think Chicago, you know, with this massive background, all the professional sports teams we have, the beautiful landscape, the topography, all those things involved, known for an incredible sports city. For us not to be on that list, from a business standpoint, those are the things that as a citizen of downtown Chicago and the state of Illinois, those are things from a business standpoint, concern me I look forward to the day that events like [the NFL league meetings] should and can be and will be held in downtown Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bears will also face resistance from Friends of the Park, a preservation group known for protecting the lakefront and parks in Chicago. Friends of the Park successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront and have been opposed to a new stadium on the museum campus.\n\nFriends of the Parks declined comment ahead of the Bears' announced press conference.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

But the Bears' plan includes an additional $2.3 billion in public financing, along with refinancing outstanding debt for prior publicly financed stadium projects for the Bears and White Sox, according to the sources.\n\nTaxpayers would be on the hook for the proposed infrastructure improvements along with about $1 billion in new borrowing to finance the new stadium south of Soldier Field, the sources said.\n\nTo make the plan a reality, the Bears want the Illinois General Assembly to approve $1.5 billion in new bonding for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which carries the debt for prior projects at Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, sources said.\n\nAbout one-third of the new borrowing would be used to roll over existing stadium debt, and the plan calls for the new borrowing to be paid off over 40 years, which also would require legislative approval.\n\nSources said the Bears' plan calls for the debt to be repaid without raising the 2% hotel tax that currently goes to ISFA.\n\nThe details are expected to be revealed at a much-anticipated news conference at noon Wednesday where officials will lay out plans for the domed stadium with increased open space.\n\nThe 2% hotel tax has fallen far short of paying off the existing debt. As a result, taxpayers still owe $629 million for past renovations of Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, whose occupants, the White Sox, also are seeking a new stadium in the South Loop. To finance a new Bears stadium using the hotel tax, the state would have to increase the borrowing limit for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority.\n\nThat could prove to be a tough sell in Springfield, however, where legislative leaders so far have given the Bears, and the Sox, a cool reception.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the Bears can legally build on the site. The city's lakefront protection ordinance calls for public use of the lakefront, and the team has called for public ownership of the stadium.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Parks opposes building a stadium for a privately owned team on the lakefront. The group successfully drove \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas away from plans to build a movie art museum on the same site, now used for parking lots.\n\nWhatever the Bears propose, they will have to win over skeptics, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who a spokesperson said Tuesday had not been briefed by the team about the stadium plans. The governor had previously called the Bears' proposed investment \"a good first step,\" and said he's willing to listen to their proposal, but said it shouldn't be a priority for the state.\n\nJoe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog group, told the Tribune in a recent interview that the Bears and Sox need to show vetted cost and revenue projections.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in the city) -- the question is, on what terms?\" he said. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) actually is viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"\n\nThe city recently went through a similar scenario, he said, when it chose the Bally's casino for development, only to find the project is already being scaled back and has funding issues.\n\n\"I think Gov. Pritzker has spoken to this exactly right, with a real wariness about public funding of sports stadiums,\" Ferguson said. \"We need to see reliable, thorough revenue projections for this before we can even open the conversation.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nMaking the situation more precarious, Ferguson said, is that all levels of government are facing financial cliffs in multiple areas -- pensions, transit and Chicago Public Schools -- with the end of billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 pandemic money.\n\nSports economist J.C. Bradbury, voicing a common concern among economists, said whatever public money is earmarked for the stadium would be better spent on other public projects, or returned to taxpayers.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\" Bradbury said. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nThe team has taken a long, strange trip to get to this point. In 2022, officials agreed to buy the former Arlington International Racecourse for $197 million, closing on the deal last year. Under prior President and CEO Ted Phillips, the team made an elaborate presentation of its plans for a $5 billion mixed-used development on the 326-acre site, with an enclosed stadium, housing and entertainment.\n\nBut since Kevin Warren became team president and CEO last year, the team has been unable to reach agreement over property taxes with local schools in the Arlington Heights area.\n\nAs the Minnesota Vikings did when Warren was an executive there, the Bears reversed course from a suburban stadium site to downtown. Warren has extolled the beauty and energy of the city, talked of his rapport with Mayor Brandon Johnson, and has said the lakefront is the \"ideal location.\"\n\n\"Absolutely we can build something that would be magnificent downtown,\" he said.\n\nThe team wouldn't necessarily have to move right away, with a lease at Soldier Field through 2033. But Warren has talked about the importance of momentum in getting the stadium project done. State lawmakers are scheduled to meet until May 24, then have a veto session in the fall, and a brief lame-duck session in the new year.\n\nReconstructing the museum campus around a new Bears stadium could help attract new residential and retail development along the lakefront, replacing some of the tax revenue lost by the declining property values of downtown office towers, said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head of the Chicago region for Savills, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nIf the Bears' proposal improves lakefront access with better public transportation with new gathering spaces, it's possible the new stadium district will attract families year-round, not just on a handful of Sundays.\n\nFeinberg said he still doesn't understand why the Bears didn't settle disagreements with Arlington Heights' officials before buying the former Churchill Downs site.\n\n\"It seems so strange they would plop down all this money, and then say this is just not working out for us,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind.\"\n\nIf the Bears do cut a deal for a lakefront stadium, it would leave Arlington Heights with a big hole to fill, said John Melaniphy of Melaniphy & Associates, a former business and development coordinator for the village of Arlington Heights. But even without football, the former racetrack site could still attract mixed-use developments with apartments, restaurants and entertainment.\n\n-- -- --\n\nChicago Tribune's Olivia Olander contributed.\n\n\u00a92024 Chicago Tribune.

The team's lease there runs through 2033.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. in suburban Arlington Heights. The team envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre (131 hectare) tract of land some 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson has made it clear he wants to keep the team in the city.\n\n\"I have said all along that meaningful private investment and a strong emphasis on public benefit are my requirements for public-private partnerships in our city,\" Johnson said last month.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said at the update.\n\nDetails from location, to traffic, to financing, to what will become of Soldier Field and more were revealed at the press conference, which Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke at. But not everyone is on board.\n\nIllinois politicians remain skeptical about the plan, which is expected to cost $4.7 billion. The team said it would contribute just over $2 billion, ask for $300 million from the NFL, and look to the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority for $900 million.\n\nThat leaves a gap of about $1.5 billion, and the team would look for public money to make up the difference.\n\n\"I wonder if it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said, after the team's update. \"It's very important to me that, with all the state needs to accomplish, that we think about what the priorities are for the state... there are a lot of priorities the state has and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nProminent Chicago preservation group Friends of the Parks also responded to the proposal. They noted lingering questions, including why the team is pushing for a faster timeline on the project, why other parks weren't vetted or chosen as the potential site, what will happen to Soldier Field and more.\n\n\"We did not hear anything at the Bears news conference that could not take place at another Chicago location. We have too many questions to make any decision about the value of these plans. We encourage the Bears and the administration to act with 'honor, integrity, transparency, wisdom and to be forward thinking and collaborative' and not repeat past mistakes,\" the group's statement read.\n\nStill, fans are trying to grasp what exactly happened, what could change and more. Here are seven big takeaways from Wednesday's press conference.\n\nThe team released renderings of the new, covered stadium Wednesday, showing plans for both inside and outside.\n\nIn addition to the renderings, the team also released a \"hype video\" showcasing the new plans.\n\nWATCH: Here's the compelling stadium hype video the Bears played at their press conference\n\nSoldier Field, which has been constructed and standing for nearly 100 years, is absent from the renderings. The historic columns, which are part of the architecture that \"pays homage to the men and women who valiantly served the country,\" according to Landmarks Illinois, remain in the renderings.\n\n\"Sports fields and gardens will replace the current stadium, with Soldier Field's historic colonnades preserved as a tribute to Chicago's military veterans,\" the team said in a release. \"An enclosed stadium is essential for Chicago to attract year-round events like the Super Bowl and major concerts -- unlocking billions in tourism revenue.\"\n\n\"As you noticed here, the plan is to keep the historical columns from Soldier Field to make that part of this development to make it one museum campus,\" Bears CEO/President Kevin Warren said during a visual presentation of the renderings. \"What happens here is the additional open and green space. This will have 14 acres of athletic fields, a recreational park to allow, as I mentioned earlier, for youth to be able to come together and do things in a productive manner.\"\n\nAs for the transition to the new stadium, Warren said the Bears will play at Soldier Field until the construction of the new stadium is complete for them to play in.\n\n\"One of the things that makes the project unique is that we would be able to continue to play at Soldier Field during the construction and then to be able to move into the new stadium once the construction is finalized,\" Warren said. \"So yes, we would be able to continue to play here and not have to move to a different location.\"\n\nThe Bears revealed plans for a \"state-of-the-art\" fixed, not a retractable roof on the stadium. Warren said while the team considered a retractable roof, it would have added \"another couple hundred million dollars.\"\n\n\"When we talked to organizations who had retractable roofs, they said they used it maybe three or four times a year,\" he said.\n\nWarren said the roof will be similar to ones seen at US Bank Stadium in Minnesota or Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas or SoFi Stadium in California.\n\n\"You'll be indoors, you'll get all the benefits of being indoors, but you'll feel like you're outdoors. You may have to wear sunglasses,\" he said.\n\nWith the increased capacity and usage, as opposed to Soldier Field, the Bears and the city of Chicago will surely run into traffic problems. Already, traffic problems exist with entering and exiting the lakefront campus; whether on foot or behind a wheel.\n\nBears newly appointed Chief Operating Officer Karen Murphy laid out the plan for traffic to the proposed stadium.\n\nThe first phase of the plan includes creating an \"improved interchange\" at 18th Street, which would become 19th Street on Lakeshore Drive. They're also looking at an entrance to the campus from the South to tie into their South parking lot.\n\nDouble-decking the South parking lot is also in the realm of possibilities.\n\nOn the North side, the Bears are looking to remove the light on Lakeshore Drive and McFetridge. They also hope to increase the space and accessibility on the lakefront path for pedestrians who are walking to the stadium.\n\nThe Bears estimate a 20% increase in campus capacity on the South side, with a 10-minute reduction in campus exit time. On the North side, they estimate a 50% increase in campus access --- likely because of the destruction of Soldier Field.\n\n\"If both these phases are done, this would be a 50% increase in lane capacity to the site, as well as a 20-minute reduction in exit times from our parking ramps, and 1,200 less hours daily for commuters on DuSable Lakeshore Drive,\" Murphy said during the presentation.\n\nThe Bears announced how they plan to fund a potential new stadium project in Chicago, and how much they believe it will cost.\n\nBears COO and executive vice president of stadium development Karen Murphy said in a presentation on Wednesday that the team expects the entire stadium project to cost $4.7 billion: $3.2 for the stadium itself and just over $300 million for the infrastructure required to open it, then $1.2 billion for two other phases of development.\n\nLast month, the team confirmed it would contribute $2 billion dollars to fund the majority of the project. On Wednesday, a slide in the presentation clarified that number would be closer to $2.025 billion dollars. After that, the team would look to an NFL stadium program for a $300 million loan. That leaves a $900 million gap for the stadium financing itself. The Bears plan has them looking to a bond mechanism in the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority program to make up the difference.\n\nThe Bears said a 2% hotel tax that is already in place for the ISFA should be able to make up the $900 million they need from public funds.\n\nThere wasn't a clear answer as to where the team would get the $300 million for the infrastructure, however. Murphy said the team is still working with the state and looking into different funding sources.\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money: one to maximize infrastructure for the stadium and surrounding campus totaling $510 million, and another phase for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million. Add up all three phases plus the IFSA funding, and it's nearly $2.4 billion in public money.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson said on Wednesday that the Bears' new plan to build a stadium in Chicago will not raise taxes on city residents.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said after the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nIt's still not clear where some of the funding will come from. Additionally, the Bears indicated they could potentially look for city money as well as state and federal dollars.\n\nShortly after their announcements, Illinois Senate president Don Harmon responded with one key question.\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer,\" Harmon said. \"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"\n\nAs Harmon alluded to, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he remains \"skeptical\" about the Bears proposal to build a new publicly-owned stadium in Chicago.\n\n\"I wonder if it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe team revealed plans for more than just a stadium, rather showcasing an entertainment hub that can host Super Bowls, playoffs, concerts and more.\n\n\"We have the best museums in the country. We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said during a press conference live Wednesday.\n\n\"We want to build a recreational and cultural campus to enhance upon the things that we have here in place. We view young students being able to study here in the park, [to] take the classrooms out of the classroom, out of the museums, and bring it into the open area and take it back into the museums and back into the classrooms,\" he said, adding that there's an \"opportunity to bid for the Super Bowl, for the Final Four, for college football playoffs, Big Ten championship games, concerts.\"\n\n\"This really becomes an international destination [for] the Olympics, World Cup,\" Warren said.\n\nAmong the new features highlighted by the team were:\n\nKevin Warren stressed that the team remains \"the largest landowner in Arlington Heights,\" but that doesn't change the fact that their focus remains on Chicago.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there.

But before the No. 1 overall pick is made, the Bears gave a first look at their jaw dropping new stadium proposal.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, the Bears fully revealed their plan for a new stadium alongside Chicago's lakefront. While football will be at the forefront, the new stadium is promising a number of amenities to the city of Chicago.\n\nThe plan calls for the community to be at the center of the project. It promises an open space for all pedestrians to enjoy with open bike lanes and a year-round epicenter to host community events. On top of it being a, \"world class,\" stadium, the Bears are looking to provide a world class environment alongside Chicago's lakefront.\n\nOf course, the project won't be cheap. With a price tag of $4.6 billion, the Bears are asking taxpayers to pay $2.3 billion to fund the stadium. The plan still needs to be approved by the city of Chicago, but the team's big plans are in place.\n\nRevealing the stadium plan is just one thing. It is going to take time for any proposal to be approved. But with question marks surrounding the future of Soldier Field, the Bears have at least taken a massive step to remedying the issue. Their new stadium looks to put Chicago at the forefront and give the Bears a look of a Super Bowl contending team. A plan is exactly that, but the Bears' vision will surely have fans percolating.\n\nStill, you can't be too certain in a scenario as groundbreaking as the one presented. The Bears called on a prayer before their press conference, hoping divine guidance will steer Chicago on the right path.\n\nIf the stadium is approved, Bears president Kevin Warren projects it to be open by 2028. In that case, Caleb Williams will be in his fifth year in the league. Jay Cutler is the last quarterback to play in Chicago for 5+ years, via Kevin Fishbain of The Athletic .\n\nIt seems like the Bears have been searching for competent quarterback play ever since. Holding the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, it seems to be on the way in Williams.\n\nHe was a dominant force during his three years at the college level, winning the Heisman Trophy in 2022. Overall, Williams threw for 10,082 yards, 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. He added another 966 yards and 27 scores on the ground.\n\nThe Bears are counting on Williams to still be their quarterback in 2028. Already moving on from Justin Fields, Chicago has gone all-in on the outgoing USC star. As the stadium plans come to fruition, they're certainly being built with Williams in mind.\n\nFor all the glitz and glimmer of the new stadium, fans just want to see success inside of it. The Bears have taken the steps to improve and will now have Williams as a major piece of the offensive puzzle. Watching Williams throw bombs with a lakefront view will be every Bears fan's dream come 2028.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_fappiano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Dan Fappiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cutler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Cutler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Chicagos-first-look-at-monster-stadium-proposal-comes-with-a-prayer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said during a press conference live Wednesday.\n\n\"We want to build a recreational and cultural campus to enhance upon the things that we have here in place. We view young students being able to study here in the park, [to] take the classrooms out of the classroom, out of the museums, and bring it into the open area and take it back into the museums and back into the classrooms,\" he said, adding that there's an \"opportunity to bid for the Super Bowl, for the Final Four, for college football playoffs, Big Ten championship games, concerts.\"\n\n\"This really becomes an international destination [for] the Olympics, World Cup,\" Warren said.\n\nThe proposal offers the first chance for fans and the city to view what the team has planned since shifting gears away from the Arlington Heights property they previously purchased.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there. But contentious negotiations about property taxes in the suburbs have become an obstacle for that plan. Earlier this year the team said it was switching its focus away from Arlington Heights back to the city.\n\n\"They're our team,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said as he touted the team's decision to return their sights to the city.\n\nRenderings of the proposed new stadium include a \"fixed\" roof, with the stadium situated atop the current South Parking lot of Soldier Field. As for Soldier Field, the columns exist, but the stadium is gone. (See the full renderings here)\n\nAmong the new features highlighted by the team were:\n\nOne of the biggest question from residents involved financing for the new plan. Johnson addressed those concerns Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said during the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bears have previously committed to contributing $2 billion to the construction of a new stadium in Chicago, but the project is expected to cost significantly more money, with estimates of a total of $4.7 billion between the stadium and infrastructure needs. The team said their investment will cover 70% of the project's funding needs.\n\nThe move has faced some criticism from preservation group Friends of the Parks, which successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront and has previously voiced opposition to the construction of any new stadium project on Museum Campus.\n\nFriends of the Parks declined comment ahead of the Bears' announced press conference.\n\nThe Bears' plans have also faced increased scrutiny amid a separate push from the Chicago White Sox to secure public funding for a stadium project in the South Loop. According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nWarren and the Bears have said they are still happy to own the Arlington Park property, and officials there remain optimistic that the team could return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nArlington Heights officials said they will be ready and waiting for if the Bears change their minds.\n\n\"There's a lot of challenges ahead with respect to the lakefront stadium in terms of financing and opposition by interest groups like Friends of the Parks... We stand ready to continue discussions with the Bears if they do get a no on the lakefront,\" Mayor Tom Hayes told NBC Chicago.\n\nHe added that while the village is respectful of the Bears' plan to explore a lakefront stadium, they believe the Arlington Heights property is a better fit.\n\n\"Other than a lake which we don't have in Arlington heights, I think everything else in Arlington heights

J.B. Pritzker says 'I remain skeptical'", "body": "By Robert McCoppin, Jeremy Gorner and Dan Petrella, Chicago Tribune The Tribune Content Agency\n\nCHICAGO - The Chicago Bears - one of the National Football League's charter franchises - on Wednesday unveiled plans for a new stadium project on the lakefront partly funded by the public that would give the team a facility in line with many of the NFL's ultra-modern, fan-friendly structures.\n\nJoined by Mayor Brandon Johnson and other local political leaders, team officials held a noontime news conference at their current home - 100-year-old Soldier Field - where they detailed what the multipurpose, fix-roofed, 77,000-capacity stadium and surrounding area would look like and sketched out how the plan would be funded.\n\nAbsent from the event was Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who earlier in the day repeated his skepticism of a plan that relies on public funding.\n\nBut Bears team President and CEO Kevin Warren called it \"a special day.\"\n\nJohnson said the project would \"result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\" He and Warren rattled off the community benefits and big-name events the project would bring, like Super Bowls, Final Fours and concerts.\n\nThe stadium would be owned by the Chicago Park District, the team said.\n\nKaren Murphy, the team's executive vice president of stadium development and chief operating officer, said the project would cost more than $4.6 billion. The stadium would cost $3.225 billion with up to $1.4 billion for infrastructure.\n\nThe Bears would commit more than $2 billion to what she called one of the biggest private investments into a public facility in Illinois history. All of the team's investment would pay for 72% of the stadium itself, with a Chicago hotel tax helping fund the rest plus all the infrastructure costs.\n\nThe project would require an increase in bonding by the Illinois State Facilities Bonding Authority.\n\nThe proposal includes 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space, with restrooms for the public. The area could be used for local youth sports, farmers markets, classes and graduations, Warren said.\n\nThe team showed a video with an artist's conception of the new stadium with what appears to be an open wall on one side with a translucent roof.\n\nIt also promised an enhanced lakefront pathway for bikes and pedestrians, with increased usable open space, and an open field for the public between the remaining colonnades from the old Soldier Field.\n\nThe stadium, by Manica architects, would have a translucent roof made of ETFE, similar to other newer NFL stadiums, and it would have a clear glass window on one wall with a view of downtown.\n\n\"You'll get all the benefits of being indoors but you'll feel like you're outdoors,\" Warren said.\n\nThe team rejected a moveble roof because it would cost a couple of hundred million dollars more, and they're trying to be fiscally responsible, Warren said.\n\nA diversity, equity and inclusion program would allow women- and minority-owned businesses and people of color an opportunity to work on and with the project.\n\nThere will be a project labor agreement and a stadium oversight committee to keep the project accountable, Warren said.\n\nWhile no new taxes would be introduced or expanded, the project is heavily reliant on public funding. And the Bears will need to overcome serious skepticism from several directions. Warren said he expected questions from the community.\n\nPritzker said Wednesday morning at an unrelated news conference that taxpayer assistance for stadium projects is \"not particularly popular around the country.\"\n\nHe noted that voters in Jackson County, Missouri, recently rejected a tax proposal to help fund stadium projects for the Kansas City Royals and Chiefs on the heels of the NFL team's latest Super Bowl victory.\n\nAs for the Bears' plans, \"I remain skeptical about this proposal, and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said. \"There are a lot of priorities that the state has, and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nPritzker said \"owners of these private businesses need to put a lot more forward in order to have their dreams fulfilled and not just rely on the taxpayers of Illinois to have that happen for them.\"\n\nTo make the plan a reality, the Bears want the Illinois General Assembly to approve new bonding for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which carries the debt for prior projects at Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, sources said.\n\nSome of the new borrowing would be used to roll over existing stadium debt, and the plan calls for the new borrowing to be paid off over 40 years, which also would require legislative approval.\n\nSources said the Bears' plan calls for the debt to be repaid without raising the 2% hotel tax that currently goes to ISFA.\n\nThe 2% hotel tax has fallen far short of paying off the existing debt. As a result, taxpayers still owe $629 million for past renovations of Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, whose occupants, the White Sox, also are seeking a new stadium in the South Loop.\n\nRaising ISFA's borrowing limit and stretching repayment over 40 years could prove to be a tough sell in Springfield, however, where legislative leaders so far have given the Bears, and the Sox, a cool reception.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the Bears can legally build on the site. The city's lakefront protection ordinance calls for public use of the lakefront, and the team has called for public ownership of the stadium.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Parks opposes building a stadium for a privately owned team on the lakefront. The group successfully drove \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas away from plans to build a movie art museum on the same site, now used for parking lots.\n\nThe Bears' proposal will have to win over skeptics, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The governor had previously called the Bears' proposed investment \"a good first step,\" and said he's willing to listen to their proposal, but said it shouldn't be a priority for the state.\n\nJoe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog group, told the Chicago Tribune in a recent interview that the Bears and Sox need to show vetted cost and revenue projections.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in the city) - the question is, on what terms?\" he said. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) actually is viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"\n\nThe city recently went through a similar scenario, he said, when it chose the Bally's casino for development, only to find the project is already being scaled back and has funding issues.\n\n\"I think Gov. Pritzker has spoken to this exactly right, with a real wariness about public funding of sports stadiums,\" Ferguson said. \"We need to see reliable, thorough revenue projections for this before we can even open the conversation.\"\n\nMaking the situation more precarious, Ferguson said, is that all levels of government are facing financial cliffs in multiple areas - pensions, transit and Chicago Public Schools - with the end of billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 pandemic money.\n\nSports economist J.C. Bradbury, voicing a common concern among economists, said whatever public money is earmarked for the stadium would be better spent on other public projects, or returned to taxpayers.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\" Bradbury said. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nThe team has taken a long, strange trip to get to this point. In 2022, officials agreed to buy the former Arlington International Racecourse for $197 million, closing on the deal last year. Under prior President and CEO Ted Phillips, the team made an elaborate presentation of its plans for a $5 billion mixed-used development on the 326-acre site, with an enclosed stadium, housing and entertainment.\n\nBut since Warren became team president and CEO last year, the team has been unable to reach an agreement over property taxes with local schools in the Arlington Heights area.\n\nAs the Minnesota Vikings did when Warren was an executive there, the Bears reversed course from a suburban stadium site to downtown. Warren has extolled the beauty and energy of the city, talked of his rapport with Mayor Brandon Johnson, and has said the lakefront is the \"ideal location.\"\n\n\"Absolutely we can build something that would be magnificent downtown,\" he said.\n\nThe team wouldn't necessarily have to move right away, with a lease at Soldier Field through 2033. But Warren has talked about the importance of momentum in getting the stadium project done. State lawmakers are scheduled to meet until May 24, then have a veto session in the fall, and a brief lame-duck session in the new year.\n\nReconstructing the museum campus around a new Bears stadium could help attract new residential and retail development along the lakefront, replacing some of the tax revenue lost by the declining property values of downtown office towers, said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head of the Chicago region for Savills, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nIf the Bears' proposal improves lakefront access with better public transportation with new gathering spaces, it's possible the new stadium district will attract families year-round, not just on a handful of Sundays.\n\nFeinberg said he still doesn't understand why the Bears didn't settle disagreements with Arlington Heights' officials before buying the former Churchill Downs site.\n\n\"It seems so strange they would plop down all this money, and then say this is just not working out for us,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind.\"\n\nIf the Bears do cut a deal for a lakefront stadium, it would leave Arlington Heights with a big hole to fill, said John Melaniphy of Melaniphy & Associates, a former business and development coordinator for the village of Arlington Heights. But even without football, the former racetrack site could still attract mixed-use developments with apartments, restaurants and entertainment.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_gorner@islandpacket.com", "name": "Jeremy Gorner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dan_petrella@islandpacket.com", "name": "Dan Petrella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Charlie E. Dates of the Progressive Baptist Church. \"I don't know that you played football, but I am asking you to help us, help us to win some games, help us to get a Super Bowl here, help us to play in a Super Bowl and bring back the 1985 roaring, cheering fans we had, for your glory and for our good.\"\n\nNow, Dates, who surely knows how to work a congregation, admitted he was joking with the part about God playing football. But it does raise the question: If the Almighty is a Bears fan, why has he been testing Chicago for so long?\n\nDates, whose church is located a foul ball away from Guaranteed Rate Field, kicked off Wednesday's news conference in which the Bears unveiled renderings and lofty promises for a new stadium and public-friendly development on the lakefront.\n\nAccording to the team, the stadium's projected cost is around $3.2 billion, of which the team promises to pay $2 billion, along with $300 million in loans from the NFL. That would put the public on the hook for $900 million for the stadium and anywhere from $325 million to well over a billion dollars for infrastructure improvements. The stadium would be a public-private deal and would have a roof.\n\nThe Bears will need the state's support for the plan, which is centered around extending a hotel tax, preferably before the end of this legislative session, which is coming soon.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker has had reservations about giving money to the team for years and the days of an Illinois governor and speaker of the house stopping the clock in Springfield to get money for a stadium are pretty much over. You can also factor in the \"Friends of the Park\" group, which helped scuttle a George Lucas museum on the museum camp. They aren't enthused about this proposal either.\n\nWho really wants to give the Bears taxpayer help? Public money for stadiums has been proven, over and over again, to be wasteful spending, but no matter where they build a new home, the Bears are going to need help paying for it. Like all sports teams, they'd prefer to get that help from the public. So why not ask? That's fair, but beyond the money, there are a lot of questions left unanswered like: Why build a domed stadium in a location where the views are part of the allure? Is this stadium really only going to hold 65,000 (give or take) fans, when the low seating capacity is a main argument to leave Soldier Field?\n\nWe can also ask: Why did the Bears choose to hold this news conference, which they had to have known would get negative press coverage, a day before drafting Caleb Williams with the first pick? Why usurp that positive moment? They could've held it in a week or two. What's the rush?\n\nBears chairman George McCaskey hired Kevin Warren to be the team's president to get this deal done, by hook or crook. On Wednesday, he was spinning faster than a Williams spiral.\n\nWarren promised that this plan, which involves adding green space where Soldier Field stands now and erecting a new stadium just south of it, could fix everything from Chicago's reputation as a big-event city to its crime rate.\n\nAccording to Warren, Chicago will have a Super Bowl, a Final Four and peace in the streets.\n\n\"This will have 14 acres of athletic fields and a recreational park to allow, as I mentioned earlier, for our youth to be able to come together and do things in a productive manner,\" Warren said. \"We have a crisis in this world with our young people. And there's a race to who gets to our young people first, the streets or us.\"\n\nAnd if this deal helps Warren's reputation, makes the McCaskeys wealthier and entertains the Grabowskis, even better. To his credit, Warren also made some more, uh, grounded promises.\n\n\"We'll build restrooms,\" Warren said. \"We'll make this a place that people want to come and spend time.\"\n\n(If you're like me, you read that and imagined James Earl Jones saying \"We'll build restrooms, Ray.\")\n\nAll of these stadium plans (and Olympic bids) include some kind of public good that could conceivably happen without the billions spent for an actual stadium. Warren isn't talking about building parks in the pockets of the city where kids really need them and it's not as if the museum campus is easily accessible for kids in the West and South sides. But the whole \"We're doing it for the kids\" rigmarole sounds better than just admitting, \"Give us money for a new stadium.\" We all know that's the truth.\n\nWhite Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf is trying to pull off a similar trick just west of Soldier Field. That's going over even worse because he's not promising much money to help, he already did this in the late 1980s and everyone (most notably White Sox fans) already blames him for the team's state of disarray.\n\nLike the Sox, the Bears got state help to redo their stadium and it was just two decades ago. How did that work out? We still have an astounding amount of public debt for the Spaceship on the Lake and the team wants to move. (The fans don't like it either, but if the Bears were any good, they wouldn't care as much.)\n\nThe Bears have been looking around for a new home for years, and it was just last winter they closed on the Arlington Park racetrack in the northwest suburbs. It seemed certain they would build a new stadium with a mixed-use business development on the 326 acres. I mean, they actually own the land. They would own the stadium. It would make sense, right?\n\nNot for the Bears, who aren't exactly known for their management success.\n\nTheir grand plans were halted by a disagreement with suburban school boards about real estate taxes, and now, the Bears, led by Warren, who lives downtown and has made friends with mayor Brandon Johnson, have pivoted back to the city and a stadium they wouldn't fully own.\n\nSome people thought this was all just posturing. But the suburban school districts did lower their ask and Warren still seems focused on staying in Chicago.\n\nYears ago, the Bears fought with former mayor (and Bears season ticket holder) Lori Lightfoot, who sarcastically told them to worry about beating the Green Bay Packers. Though the Bears haven't done that since 2018, before Lightfoot was even elected, they have found more success dealing with Johnson. Now, they just have to charm Pritzker and the state legislature.\n\nGood luck.\n\nIn the news conference, Johnson predictably mentioned Daniel Burnham, the father of the Plan of Chicago and the hero of the city's protected lakefront. It's the politician's version of invoking Papa Bear Halas or Mike Ditka.\n\n\"Daniel Burnham's vision for the lakefront was to center it around people, the people of Chicago,\" Johnson said. \"He envisioned an active lakefront with space and amusement for everyone to enjoy. The plan revitalizes that vision.\"\n\nBurnham died in 1912, nine years before the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago, so we'll never know what his feelings are on domed stadiums versus \"Bear Weather.\"\n\nBut he'd agree that Warren and the Bears aren't making small plans here. Will these plans be realized?

As of Thursday afternoon, the Bears had this message pinned atop their X page: \"A world-class destination for a world-class city.\"\n\nAnd the renderings of the proposed new stadium the team released Wednesday were certainly impressive.\n\nSo, from the team's perspective, everything sounds great: A beautiful new stadium, right on the lake, with a roof, public-use fields and recreational spaces, additional green space, access to the lakefront, a plaza, shopping, year-round attractions, a hotel, and presumably whatever else a football fan or tourist could want.\n\nSurely, Chicago would then be host to Super Bowls and Final Fours.\n\nObviously, this is the No. 1 topic of debate for such a project.\n\nThe Bears are calling this a \"public-private partnership,\" which means there's public money involved. When average citizens hear that, of course, they immediately think taxes.\n\nThree main sources of funding would be:\n\nBonds are a complicated thing, but WGN political reporter Tahman Bradley provided a nice breakdown by Wednesday evening about what those main financials look like. Check out more in the video below:\n\nStill, more money is needed, as the Sun-Times reports.\n\nSpecifically, that report says, the Bears' plan includes at least $325 million in taxpayer-backed infrastructure improvements for the stadium and Museum Campus.\n\nThis is where tax-paying citizens get nervous. To make a plan as large and ambitious as the one the Bears are proposing come to fruition, the amount needed for such \"infrastructure improvements\" can escalate in a hurry.\n\nAnyone that's done a major home renovation can tell you this.\n\nAnd, judging by his remarks throughout Wednesday's press conference, so is Mayor Brandon Johnson.\n\n\"This is going to reinvigorate the entire City of Chicago,\" he said. \"It will be the crown jewel of the City of Chicago.\"\n\nJohnson said he's worked closely with Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren to ensure that a new stadium project would include both large-scale investment from the Bears and result in facilities that benefit the entire community.\n\nThose conditions appear to have been satisfied for the mayor.\n\n\"What I've said from the very beginning is that an investment like this requires real skin in the game from ownership, which they've done that,\" he said. \"A commitment to public use, they've done that, as well as an overall committee to building a better, stronger, safer Chicago.\"\n\nWho's opposed?\n\nThe opposition came out quickly during and after Wednesday's press conference.\n\nThe state's top leaders, for example, did not seem moved by the Bears' glamorous proposal.\n\nGov. Pritzker said he was not invited to Wednesday's event, but he issued comments at an unrelated press conference reiterating what he's always felt about the state using public funding to build professional sports venues.\n\nThat he's not in favor.\n\n\"I'm highly skeptical of the proposal that's been made, and I believe strongly that this is not a high priority for legislators, and certainly not for me, when I compare it to all the other things,\" Pritzker said.\n\nHouse Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch, also a Democrat, said there isn't widespread support for the Bears' plan\n\n\"I'm going to say to you publicly what I said to Kevin Warren privately last week: If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail, and it would fail miserably,\" Welch said. \"There's no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nFormer Gov. Pat Quinn, meanwhile, railed against taxpayer subsidies and wants to take the matter to the voters, something he's already proposed to do.\n\nWhile Mayor Johnson and Warren positioned the Bears' proposal as a \"crown jewel\" for the city -- which, in theory, it could be -- it appears they could be in for a fight with state legislators if they want to get it done.\n\nAnd then there's the advocacy group Friends of the Parks, which has provided staunch opposition to lakefront projects before.\n\nFOTP issued a scathing response Wednesday to the Bears' proposal, debunking the team's claims on what a new stadium would cost and who it would benefit and comparing the plan to other city projects that FOTP says did \"not end well for taxpayers.\"\n\n\"The 'Chicago Way' was on full display at the Chicago Bears' news conference today,\" FOTP said in its statement. \"Once again, Chicago taxpayers are being told what is good for them.\"\n\nFOTP went on to issue a list of detailed questions that it feels must be asked before any stadium project could proceed, including whether the Bears have even considered other locations in the city.\n\n\"This is a time for some thoughtful, deliberate and civic engagement,\" FOTP said. \"A civil, community-driven conversation should be at the forefront of any action the City of Chicago takes regarding the lakefront.\"\n\nWhat about Arlington Heights?\n\nAdding another layer of intrigue is the matter of the Arlington Park property in the northwest suburb of Arlington Heights that the Bears still own.\n\nThe Bears purchased the site, formerly home to Arlington International Racecourse, in February 2023 for $197.2 million. Demolition on the racecourse began soon after.\n\nAt the time, it seemed likely the Bears would be making their future home in the northwest suburbs.\n\nHowever, the Bears and local school districts in and around Arlington Heights reached an impasse on the valuation of the property, leaving the Bears with a higher property tax burden there than they feel they should have.\n\nSo the Bears seem to have moved on from Arlington Park, saying for a while now that their focus is on the City of Chicago.\n\nWednesday's unveiling certainly gave the lakefront plans more confirmation.\n\nBut that doesn't mean a Bears' move to Arlington Heights is necessarily dead.\n\nThe Bears still own the Arlington Park property, and Arlington Heights Mayor Tom Hayes has said his village remains a great location for a new Bears stadium \"if they get a 'no' on the lakefront.\"\n\nIt would seem Arlington Heights remains well-positioned as a back-up plan, at least for now.\n\nFans generally want a team that can compete for a Super Bowl title on the field, all while playing in a comfortable, state-of-the art stadium that attracts tourist dollars, and they don't want to reach too deep into their pockets for it.\n\nOf course, that's a big wish list.\n\nFans weighed in with WGN after Wednesday's announcement. Not surprisingly, many who stopped to talk said they would be supportive of the Bears staying in the city along the lakefront, but most felt taxpayers should not be on the hook for such a large chunk of the project.\n\nSee more in the video below:\n\nAnd for anyone who thinks fans will accept anything as long as the hometown team wins, well, it's important to point out that's not necessarily the case.\n\nTake the Kansas City Chiefs, winners of three of the last five Super Bowls.\n\nIn a sales tax measure sent to the polls in Kansas City that would've helped fund a new downtown baseball stadium for the Royals, along with major renovations for the Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium, voters handily struck it down, with 58% of those who hit the polls voting against the measure.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThis isn't a satisfying answer, but it all remains to be seen. A lot is still up in the air.\n\nThe only thing for certain is that before any ground is broken on a new Bears stadium, there are likely to be more twists and turns and changes to best-laid plans.\n\nFor Thursday night, then, Bears fans can just relax and think about the next crop of players they'll root for on the field.\n\nThey may not get a new stadium just yet, but they can still get a new quaterback.\n\nAnd if history is any indication, that's been much harder for the Bears to find.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_johnson@wgntv.com", "name": "Michael Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Town square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Burnham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Braves_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Braves men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WGN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Quinn_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Quinn (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_appraisal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate appraisal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

The Bears have already promised to pony up $2 billion for a new lakefront domed stadium.\n\nThe Bears' pitch could require the city to invest $1 billion to overhaul Museum Campus, according to Crain's Chicago. Mayor Brandon Johnson has kept the door open on giving the Bears public funding.\n\nPark advocacy group Friends of the Parks has already raised concerns over a new stadium taking away space from the crowded lakefront.\n\nWednesday's stadium pitch will come a day before the Bears are expected to select USC quarterback Caleb Williams as the No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft.\n\nPinning hopes back on the lakefront marks a significant change for the team, which has threatened for years to leave the city for suburban Arlington Heights.\n\nThe Bears finalized the purchase last year of Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs for $197 million. Team officials said they'd develop the 326-acre site into a $5 billion entertainment district anchored by a domed stadium.\n\nAt the time, then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot had pitched the team on a glass-domed renovation of Soldier Field, largely considered a Hail Mary proposal.\n\nSolider Field -- save for its historical colonnades and war memorial -- would likely be torn down under the team's current proposal, the Sun-Times previously reported.", "source": {"uri": "blockclubchicago.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Block Club Chicago"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mack_liederman@blockclubchicago.org", "name": "Mack Liederman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Parks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Manitoba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Manitoba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Manitoba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Lightfoot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lori Lightfoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonnade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonnade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hail Mary pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_memorial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War memorial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2021/11/111921-Soldier-Field-Museum-Campus-Colin-Boyle-0437.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The historic columns, which are part of the architecture that \"pays homage to the men and women who valiantly served the country,\" according to Landmarks Illinois, remain in the renderings.\n\n\"Sports fields and gardens will replace the current stadium, with Soldier Field's historic colonnades preserved as a tribute to Chicago's military veterans,\" the team said in a release. \"An enclosed stadium is essential for Chicago to attract year-round events like the Super Bowl and major concerts -- unlocking billions in tourism revenue.\"\n\n\"As you noticed here, the plan is to keep the historical columns from Soldier Field to make that part of this development to make it one museum campus,\" Bears CEO/President Kevin Warren said during a visual presentation of the renderings. \"What happens here is the additional open and green space. This will have 14 acres of athletic fields, a recreational park to allow, as I mentioned earlier, for youth to be able to come together and do things in a productive manner.\"\n\nAs for the transition to the new stadium, Warren said the Bears will play at Soldier Field until the construction of the new stadium is complete for them to play in.\n\n\"One of the things that makes the project unique is that we would be able to continue to play at Soldier Field during the construction and then to be able to move into the new stadium once the construction is finalized,\" Warren said. \"So yes, we would be able to continue to play here and not have to move to a different location.\"\n\nThe Bears revealed plans for a \"state-of-the-art\" fixed, not a retractable roof on the stadium. Warren said while the team considered a retractable roof, it would have added \"another couple hundred million dollars.\"\n\n\"When we talked to organizations who had retractable roofs, they said they used it maybe three or four times a year,\" he said.\n\nWarren said the roof will be similar to ones seen at US Bank Stadium in Minnesota or Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas or SoFi Stadium in California.\n\n\"You'll be indoors, you'll get all the benefits of being indoors, but you'll feel like you're outdoors. You may have to wear sunglasses,\" he said.\n\nWith the increased capacity and usage, as opposed to Soldier Field, the Bears and the city of Chicago will surely run into traffic problems. Already, traffic problems exist with entering and exiting the lakefront campus; whether on foot or behind a wheel.\n\nBears newly appointed Chief Operating Officer Karen Murphy laid out the plan for traffic to the proposed stadium.\n\nThe first phase of the plan includes creating an \"improved interchange\" at 18th Street, which would become 19th Street on Lakeshore Drive. They're also looking at an entrance to the campus from the South to tie into their South parking lot.\n\nDouble-decking the South parking lot is also in the realm of possibilities.\n\nOn the North side, the Bears are looking to remove the light on Lakeshore Drive and McFetridge. They also hope to increase the space and accessibility on the lakefront path for pedestrians who are walking to the stadium.\n\nThe Bears estimate a 20% increase in campus capacity on the South side, with a 10-minute reduction in campus exit time. On the North side, they estimate a 50% increase in campus access --- likely because of the destruction of Soldier Field.\n\n\"If both these phases are done, this would be a 50% increase in lane capacity to the site, as well as a 20-minute reduction in exit times from our parking ramps, and 1,200 less hours daily for commuters on DuSable Lakeshore Drive,\" Murphy said during the presentation.\n\nThe Bears announced how they plan to fund a potential new stadium project in Chicago, and how much they believe it will cost.\n\nBears COO and executive vice president of stadium development Karen Murphy said in a presentation on Wednesday that the team expects the entire stadium project to cost $4.7 billion: $3.2 for the stadium itself and just over $300 million for the infrastructure required to open it, then $1.2 billion for two other phases of development.\n\nLast month, the team confirmed it would contribute $2 billion dollars to fund the majority of the project. On Wednesday, a slide in the presentation clarified that number would be closer to $2.025 billion dollars. After that, the team would look to an NFL stadium program for a $300 million loan. That leaves a $900 million gap for the stadium financing itself. The Bears plan has them looking to a bond mechanism in the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority program to make up the difference.\n\nThe Bears said a 2% hotel tax that is already in place for the ISFA should be able to make up the $900 million they need from public funds.\n\nThere wasn't a clear answer as to where the team would get the $300 million for the infrastructure, however. Murphy said the team is still working with the state and looking into different funding sources.\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money: one to maximize infrastructure for the stadium and surrounding campus totaling $510 million, and another phase for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million. Add up all three phases plus the IFSA funding, and it's nearly $2.4 billion in public money.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson said on Wednesday that the Bears' new plan to build a stadium in Chicago will not raise taxes on city residents.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said after the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nIt's still not clear where some of the funding will come from. Additionally, the Bears indicated they could potentially look for city money as well as state and federal dollars.\n\nThe team revealed plans for more than just a stadium, rather showcasing an entertainment hub that can host Super Bowls, playoffs, concerts and more.\n\n\"We have the best museums in the country. We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said during a press conference live Wednesday.\n\n\"We want to build a recreational and cultural campus to enhance upon the things that we have here in place. We view young students being able to study here in the park, [to] take the classrooms out of the classroom, out of the museums, and bring it into the open area and take it back into the museums and back into the classrooms,\" he said, adding that there's an \"opportunity to bid for the Super Bowl, for the Final Four, for college football playoffs, Big Ten championship games, concerts.\"\n\n\"This really becomes an international destination [for] the Olympics, World Cup,\" Warren said.\n\nAmong the new features highlighted by the team were:\n\nKevin Warren stressed that the team remains \"the largest landowner in Arlington Heights,\" but that doesn't change the fact that their focus remains on Chicago.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there. But contentious negotiations about property taxes in the suburbs have become an obstacle for that plan. Earlier this year the team said it was switching its focus away from Arlington Heights back to the city.\n\n\"They're our team,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said as he touted the team's decision to return their sights to the city.\n\nArlington Heights officials said they will be ready and waiting for if the Bears change their minds.\n\n\"There's a lot of challenges ahead with respect to the lakefront stadium in terms of financing and opposition by interest groups like Friends of the Parks... We stand ready to continue discussions with the Bears if they do get a no on the lakefront,\" Mayor Tom Hayes told NBC Chicago.\n\nHe added that while the village is respectful of the Bears' plan to explore a lakefront stadium, they believe the Arlington Heights property is a better fit.\n\n\"Other than a lake which we don't have in Arlington heights, I think everything else in Arlington heights is a better solution for them,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Shore_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake Shore Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_(road)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interchange (road)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMAQ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WMAQ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

The stadium would be located just south of Soldier Field, where the Bears currently play. In addition to Bears games, the stadium would also host concerts and other entertainment events, and would be usable year-round thanks to a fixed translucent roof.\n\nThe team is pledging $2.3 billion to the project, and estimates that it will create 4,200 new annual jobs and have an annual economic impact of $456 million once completed. The total cost is expected to be $4.7 billion -- $3.2 billion for the stadium and $1.5 billion for infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe club is seeking $900 million in public funding through the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, and will also apply for a $300 million NFL loan. Taxpayers would be on the hook for the infrastructure improvements to the Museum Campus, but Mayor Brandon Johnson said the project would not raise taxes for residents.\n\nThe new stadium would be publicly owned and include 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space. There is no timeline on when construction would start or end.\n\nThis latest move comes as a pivot by the Bears. The team purchased the former Arlington International Racecourse for $197 million in 2023, with the intention of turning the 326-acre site into a mixed-use development. However, negotiations regarding property taxes in Arlington Heights have caused the club to switch its focus back to a new stadium in Chicago.\n\nSoldier Field has been the home of the Bears since 1971. It has a capacity of 62,500 for football games, making it the second smallest stadium in the NFL. In 2001, Soldier Field underwent major renovations -- largely funded by public dollars -- that were criticized and resulted in the stadium being delisted as a National Historic Landmark.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971.

While a new home venue will surely bring some excitement in Chicago, one caveat is sure to rub Bears fans the wrong way.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, the new stadium plan is expected to cost $4.6 billion. However, half of that is expected to be paid for by taxpayers, via Jeremy Gorner, Dan Petrella and Robert McCoppin of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nWhile Bears fans want to see the team win, it's another thing to pay $2.3 million to fund their stadium. Social media was flooded with angry responses once that key part of Chicago's plan was revealed.\n\nThe stadium itself will cost $3.2 billion with another $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvements. Taxpayers still owe $629 million on improvements made at Soldier Field. The new plan in place is projected to take around 40 years to pay off.\n\nUltimately, Chicago has been working with Illinois' government to find a financial and geographical location that works. The proposed site has come into question as well due to it being a lakefront stadium. The Bears must work to find a financial plan that works and get approval from the state to build the stadium.\n\nJoe Ferguson, president of the Civic Foundation, has been well aware of the ongoing stadium proposals and how they're affecting taxpayers. He knows no one wants the Bears to leave Chicago. However, he says there first must be a plan in place that works for the team, state and taxpayers.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in the city), the question is on what terms?\" Ferguson asked. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) is actually viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"\n\n\"I think Gov. (J.B) Pitzker has spoken to this exactly right, with a real wariness about public funding of sports stadiums,\" Ferguson continued. \"We need to see reliable, thorough revenue projections for this before we can even open the conversation.\"\n\nMuch more will be known about the Bears' stadium plans after their press conference. However, taxpayers being forced to $2.3 billion has already become a major sticking point with fans.\n\nBears hoping new stadium leads to better results\n\nChicago was careful to plan out the announcement of their new stadium. With the NFL Draft taking place a day later, all Bears fans will have their eyes glued to the screen to see who the Bears will take. Perhaps that'll be enough to distract from the new $2.3 billion owed.\n\nAs they watch, those fans should be prepared to hear Caleb Williams' name called. While nothing is set in stone, he is far and away the consensus favorite to go No. 1 overall. A former Heisman Trophy winner, Williams threw for 10,082 yards, 93 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.\n\nBut the fun won't stop there, as Chicago also holds the No. 9 overall pick in the draft. With still a few holes to fill, the Bears could go in numerous different routes with the selection.\n\nWhoever they pick, the Bears are hoping they become fixtures in their new stadium for years to come. A team seemingly on the rise, Chicago fans will love seeing the team's new offense with Williams under center. However, they won't like the stadium price they'll have to pay to see their favorite team in action.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_fappiano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Dan Fappiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Bears-news-Chicagos-2.3-billion-stadium-request-has-fans-ticked-off.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The move builds materially on the Bears' announced intent last month to stay in the city of Chicago after a lengthy tour of alternate options across the area suburbs.\n\nLike any other stadium project, there is still a very long way to go between an event like this press conference and an actual opening. But this latest step does show the depth of the Bears' desire to hone in on this particular location after initial resistance surfaced from two local preservation groups as well as in Arlington Heights, where the Bears previously intended to build the stadium.\n\nAnd also like many other stadium developments, there are still significant questions about financing of the Bears' project. The venue itself is projected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, with perhaps another $1 billion going toward roads and infrastructure improvements. The Bears have pledged $2 billion toward the effort. There have been talks about a potential \"financing partnership\" with the White Sox in which both teams would take a more collaborative approach to help ensure their respective efforts to build new stadiums get done.\n\nBut how that remaining funding gap is filled, presumably with some form of taxpayer assistance, will be a critical factor -- particularly given that there is no deal in place with either the city of Chicago or the state of Illinois.\n\n\"If we're going to build 21st-century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire of Chicago, and these conversations, particularly with the Bears, have been quite positive,\" Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson said last week. \"I appreciate the leadership of [team president] Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nThe Bears' stadium saga remains one of the most closely watched issues across the NFL, as well as the rest of the sports industry. Despite being the country's third-largest media market, Chicago, for years, has been shut out of hosting major events such as the Super Bowl and Final Four, as it does not have a large-scale domed stadium.\n\nThe White Sox, meanwhile, are facing some resistance in their efforts to build a successor facility to Guaranteed Rate Field, and do so closer to downtown Chicago. Johnson recently vetoed an idea of using the city's amusement tax for either the Bears' stadium project or the one advanced by White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and added that the MLB team owner needs to \"put some skin in the game.\"\n\nTo that end, Crain's Chicago Business reported that Reinsdorf is prepared to pay at least $200 million toward the project. But with initial cost estimates for the White Sox stadium hovering around $1.2 billion -- a figure likely to escalate -- a significant funding gap remains there, too.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_schiffer@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Alex Schiffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "margaret_fleming@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Margaret Fleming", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crain's_Chicago_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crain's Chicago Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_17391534_168393969_lowres-scaled-e1692988843780.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nThe team said last month it was prepared to provide more than $2 billion in funding toward a publicly owned stadium in the city.\n\nThe proposal calls for $2.025 billion from the Bears, $300 million from an NFL loan and $900 million in bonds from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline.

The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights.

J.B. Pritzker, who earlier in the day repeated his skepticism of a plan that relies on public funding.\n\nBut Bears team president and CEO Kevin Warren called it \"a special day.\"\n\nJohnson said the project would \"result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\" He and Warren rattled off the community benefits and big-name events the project would bring, like Super Bowls, Final Fours and concerts.\n\nThe stadium would be owned by the Chicago Park District, the team said.\n\nKaren Murphy, the team's executive vice president of stadium development and chief operating officer, said the project would cost more than $4.6 billion. The stadium would cost $3.225 billion with up to $1.4 billion for infrastructure.\n\nThe Bears would commit more than $2 billion into what she called one of the biggest private investments into a public facility in Illinois history. All of the team's investment would pay for 72% of the stadium itself, with a Chicago hotel tax helping fund the rest plus all the infrastructure costs.\n\nThe project would require an increase in bonding by the Illinois State Facilities Bonding Authority.\n\nThe proposal includes 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space, with restrooms for the public. The area could be used for local youth sports, farmers markets, classes and graduations, Warren said.\n\nThe team showed a video with an artist's conception of the new stadium with what appears to be an open wall on one side with a translucent roof.\n\nIt also promised an enhanced lakefront pathway for bikes and pedestrians, with increased usable open space, and an open field for the public between the remaining colonnades from the old Soldier Field.\n\nThe stadium, by Manica architects, would have a translucent roof made of ETFE, similar to other newer NFL stadiums, and it would have a clear glass window on one wall with a view of downtown.\n\n\"You'll get all the benefits of being indoors but you'll feel like you're outdoors,\" Warren said.\n\nThe team rejected a moveable roof because it would cost a couple of hundred million dollars more, and they're trying to be fiscally responsible, Warren said.\n\nA diversity, equity and inclusion program would allow women- and minority- owned businesses and people of color an opportunity to work on and with the project.\n\nThere will be a project labor agreement and a stadium oversight committee to keep the project accountable, Warren said.\n\nWhile no new taxes would be introduced or expanded, the project is heavily reliant on public funding. And the Bears will need to overcome serious skepticism from several directions. Warren said he expected questions from the community.\n\nPritzker said Wednesday morning at an unrelated news conference that taxpayer assistance for stadium projects is \"not particularly popular around the country.\"\n\nHe noted that voters in Jackson County, Missouri recently rejected a tax proposal to help fund stadium projects for the Kansas City Royals and Chiefs on the heels of the NFL team's latest Super Bowl victory.\n\nAs for the Bears' plans, \"I remain skeptical about this proposal, and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said. \"There are a lot of priorities that the state has, and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nPritzker said \"the owners of these private businesses need to put a lot more forward in order to have their dreams fulfilled and not just rely on the taxpayers of Illinois to have that happen for them.\"\n\nTo make the plan a reality, the Bears want the Illinois General Assembly to approve new bonding for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which carries the debt for prior projects at Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, sources said.\n\nSome of the new borrowing would be used to roll over existing stadium debt, and the plan calls for the new borrowing to be paid off over 40 years, which also would require legislative approval.\n\nSources said the Bears' plan calls for the debt to be repaid without raising the 2% hotel tax that currently goes to ISFA.\n\nThe 2% hotel tax has fallen far short of paying off the existing debt. As a result, taxpayers still owe $629 million for past renovations of Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, whose occupants, the White Sox, also are seeking a new stadium in the South Loop.\n\nRaising ISFA's borrowing limit and stretching repayment over 40 years could prove to be a tough sell in Springfield, however, where legislative leaders so far have given the Bears, and the Sox, a cool reception.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the Bears can legally build on the site. The city's lakefront protection ordinance calls for public use of the lakefront, and the team has called for public ownership of the stadium.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Parks opposes building a stadium for a privately owned team on the lakefront. The group successfully drove \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas away from plans to build a movie art museum on the same site, now used for parking lots.\n\nThe Bears' proposal will have to win over skeptics, including Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The governor had previously called the Bears' proposed investment \"a good first step,\" and said he's willing to listen to their proposal, but said it shouldn't be a priority for the state.\n\nAs the Chicago Bears prepare to unveil their vision for a new downtown stadium, projects in other NFL cities could prove instructive\n\nJoe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog group, told the Tribune in a recent interview that the Bears and Sox need to show vetted cost and revenue projections.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in the city) -- the question is, on what terms?\" he said. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) actually is viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"\n\nThe city recently went through a similar scenario, he said, when it chose the Bally's casino for development, only to find the project is already being scaled back and has funding issues.\n\n\"I think Gov. Pritzker has spoken to this exactly right, with a real wariness about public funding of sports stadiums,\" Ferguson said. \"We need to see reliable, thorough revenue projections for this before we can even open the conversation.\"\n\nMaking the situation more precarious, Ferguson said, is that all levels of government are facing financial cliffs in multiple areas -- pensions, transit and Chicago Public Schools -- with the end of billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 pandemic money.\n\nSports economist J.C. Bradbury, voicing a common concern among economists, said whatever public money is earmarked for the stadium would be better spent on other public projects, or returned to taxpayers.\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\" Bradbury said. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nThe team has taken a long, strange trip to get to this point. In 2022, officials agreed to buy the former Arlington International Racecourse for $197 million, closing on the deal last year. Under prior President and CEO Ted Phillips, the team made an elaborate presentation of its plans for a $5 billion mixed-used development on the 326-acre site, with an enclosed stadium, housing and entertainment.\n\nBut since Warren became team president and CEO last year, the team has been unable to reach an agreement over property taxes with local schools in the Arlington Heights area.\n\nAs the Minnesota Vikings did when Warren was an executive there, the Bears reversed course from a suburban stadium site to downtown. Warren has extolled the beauty and energy of the city, talked of his rapport with Mayor Brandon Johnson, and has said the lakefront is the \"ideal location.\"\n\n\"Absolutely we can build something that would be magnificent downtown,\" he said.\n\nThe team wouldn't necessarily have to move right away, with a lease at Soldier Field through 2033. But Warren has talked about the importance of momentum in getting the stadium project done. State lawmakers are scheduled to meet until May 24, then have a veto session in the fall, and a brief lame-duck session in the new year.\n\nReconstructing the museum campus around a new Bears stadium could help attract new residential and retail development along the lakefront, replacing some of the tax revenue lost by the declining property values of downtown office towers, said Eric Feinberg, vice chairman and co-head of the Chicago region for Savills, a commercial real estate firm.\n\nIf the Bears' proposal improves lakefront access with better public transportation with new gathering spaces, it's possible the new stadium district will attract families year-round, not just on a handful of Sundays.\n\nFeinberg said he still doesn't understand why the Bears didn't settle disagreements with Arlington Heights' officials before buying the former Churchill Downs site.\n\n\"It seems so strange they would plop down all this money, and then say this is just not working out for us,\" he said. \"It boggles my mind.\"\n\nIf the Bears do cut a deal for a lakefront stadium, it would leave Arlington Heights with a big hole to fill, said John Melaniphy of Melaniphy & Associates, a former business and development coordinator for the village of Arlington Heights. But even without football, the former racetrack site could still attract mixed-use developments with apartments, restaurants and entertainment.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_gorner@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Jeremy Gorner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "robert_mccoppin@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Robert McCoppin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dan_petrella@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Dan Petrella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report. ___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The catch? They would like Chicago taxpayers to foot $2.3 billion, or roughly half of the massive bill. Never mind that Chicagoans still owe more than $600 million on the gaudy renovations to Soldier Field in 2003 that was rushed through the state legislature in two weeks. The Bears are also hoping taxpayers forget about the fact they would like to build this new stadium on a public park.\n\nWhen considering the curious timing and the stalled negotiations with Arlington Heights, it seems pretty clear the Bears just expect everyone to roll out a red carpet for them. That arrogant presumptuousness should assuredly get them nowhere.\n\nSports economist J.C. Bradbury had a righteous take on the whole situation.\n\nMore from the Chicago Tribune:\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\" Bradbury said to the Tribune. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nI can't even begin to explain how this whole story makes my blood boil.\n\nThe Bears wanted to break ground in Arlington Heights, but didn't like the property taxes on the development and expected more public funding. So, in likely trying to strong-arm the Chicago suburb (and the city of Chicago) for their demands, they are now announcing their plans for a new lakefront stadium approximately one day before the 2024 NFL Draft. That's right. They are essentially using the prospect of drafting Caleb Williams at No. 1 overall to say \"look who's (maybe) about to change our franchise! The money for this stadium will be worth it. Trust us!\" They couldn't be more transparently impudent to the city and to their fans.\n\nBut this is where the Bears are wrong and where they will rightfully run into another roadblock.\n\nTaxpayers should never be expected to foot any part of the bill for a new professional sports stadium. It is morally and ethically wrong to force people with regular bills and regular jobs to pay for what is essentially a shiny new and unnecessary entertainment complex. Always. Full stop. Sports are not that important to everyday life, and other aspects deserve much more priority and investment. The Bears are trying to take advantage of their cultural capital by threading a needle about their importance to the city of Chicago to get money they don't even have themselves. Never mind that the city is accustomed to the embarrassing and disappointing product they put out on the football field for decades now.\n\nFor that reason, the Bears grossly overestimate how much power and influence they hold over the heart of the Midwest. They have zero leverage here.\n\nHere's a novel idea repeated because it is evergreen. If George McCaskey (and Warren, by extension) want a new stadium, he should pay for it out of his own damn pocket.\n\nNFL fans saw right through the Bears' proposal for a new 'publicly owned' stadium", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_zeglinski@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Zeglinski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California State Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McCaskey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George McCaskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/04/USATSI_19806356-e1713971749316.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

We have the most beautiful lakefront. We have the most vivid downtown architectural design. And this affords us the opportunity to be able to bring this all together in the greatest city on the planet,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said during a press conference live Wednesday. \"We want to build a recreational and cultural campus to enhance upon the things that we have here in place. We view young students being able to study here in the park, [to] take the classrooms out of the classroom, out of the museums, and bring it into the open area and take it back into the museums and back into the classrooms. And now when you start thinking about having an opportunity to bid for the Super Bowl, for the Final Four, for college football playoffs, Big Ten championship games, concerts. This really becomes an international destination [for] the Olympics, World Cup.\"\n\nThe proposal offers the first chance for fans and the city to view what the team has planned since shifting gears away from the Arlington Heights property they previously purchased.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there. But contentious negotiations about property taxes in the suburbs have become an obstacle for that plan. Earlier this year the team said it was switching its focus away from Arlington Heights back to the city.\n\n\"They're our team,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said as he touted the team's decision to return their sights to the city.\n\nRenderings of the proposed new stadium include a \"fixed\" roof, with the stadium situated atop the current South Parking lot of Soldier Field. As for Soldier Field, the columns exist, but the stadium is gone. (See the full renderings here)\n\nOne of the biggest question from residents involved financing for the new plan. Johnson addressed those concerns Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said during the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bears have previously committed to contributing $2 billion to the construction of a new stadium in Chicago, but the project is expected to cost significantly more money.\n\nThe move has faced some criticism from preservation group Friends of the Parks, which successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront and has previously voiced opposition to the construction of any new stadium project on Museum Campus.\n\nFriends of the Parks declined comment ahead of the Bears' announced press conference.\n\nThe Bears' plans have also faced increased scrutiny amid a separate push from the Chicago White Sox to secure public funding for a stadium project in the South Loop. According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nWarren and the Bears have said they are still happy to own the Arlington Park property, and officials there remain optimistic that the team could return to the negotiating table.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nArlington Heights officials said they will be ready and waiting for if the Bears change their minds.\n\n\"There's a lot of challenges ahead with respect to the lakefront stadium in terms of financing and opposition by interest groups like Friends of the Parks... We stand ready to continue discussions with the Bears if they do get a no on the lakefront,\" Mayor Tom Hayes told NBC Chicago.\n\nHe added that while the village is respectful of the Bears' plan to explore a lakefront stadium, they believe the Arlington Heights property is a better fit.\n\n\"Other than a lake which we don't have in Arlington heights, I think everything else in Arlington heights is a better solution for them,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\nHistory photos: Chicago's Soldier Field through the years Soldier Field - 2003 Soldier Field - 1971 Soldier Field - 1931 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1987 Soldier Field - 1926 Soldier Field - 1933 Soldier Field - 1928 Soldier Field - 1939 Soldier Field - 1962 Soldier Field - 1946 Soldier Field - 1978 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1943 Soldier Field - 1936 Soldier Field - 1932 Soldier Field - 1961 Soldier Field - 1974 Soldier Field - 1948 Soldier Field - 1927 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1927 Soldier Field - 1973 Soldier Field - 2003 Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports The Economy American Football Politics Construction Industry Law Trade Journalism City Planning Finance Architecture Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brian_cassella@pantagraph.com", "name": "Brian Cassella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "trent_sprague@pantagraph.com", "name": "Trent Sprague", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLean_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McLean County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McLean County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Driving under the influence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The move could be seen as an attempt to ease concerns from preservation group Friends of the Parks, which successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront and has previously voiced opposition to the construction of any new stadium project on Museum Campus.\n\nFriends of the Parks declined comment ahead of the Bears' announced press conference.\n\nThe Bears' plans have also faced increased scrutiny amid a separate push from the Chicago White Sox to secure public funding for a stadium project in the South Loop. According to a recent Crain's report, the teams have been told that there is little appetite on the part of lawmakers to approve separate financing plans for stadiums, and urged the two teams to work together.\n\nThe Bears have pledged up to $2 billion in private funding for a stadium, but have not announced other financing details ahead of Wednesday's press conference.\n\nBears President Kevin Warren recently discussed the change of direction in the team's plans during media availabilities at the NFL league meetings in Orlando.\n\nListen to Kevin Warren's full press conference\n\nWhen asked about the Bears' pivot to the lakefront and the steam their plan is gaining, Warren noted there is still a long way to go, but he believes things are moving in the right direction.\n\n\"All of these projects are, you know, that's a great word. They require momentum. They require vision,\" Warren said. \"They require tenacity. They require a lot of thought and planning, but they also require momentum. And I strongly believe that we're building momentum to that museum area.\n\n\"So when you have that combination of the museum, the lakefront, the beach, the architecture, and most of all, what makes Chicago special is the people. And so when you can mix that together, you do get great momentum, but it's going to require a lot of work as we proceed forward.\"\n\nWarren and the Bears are happy to own the Arlington Park property, but their sights are set on downtown.\n\n\"We are the largest landowner in Arlington Heights right now. 326 acres,\" Warren said. \"We own a beautiful piece of land. And I have great respect for Mayor Hayes and Randy Recklaus and all of the politicians there. My belief right now, these projects are incredibly difficult. And just learning the various things that I did in Minnesota, you have to be laser-focused. And right now, we're putting our energy to downtown Chicago, to the museum campus, just from an energy and resource standpoint. So we still own the land. We're the largest landowner. We'll stay in communication with Arlington Heights, but the focus now has to be on Chicago to give us the best opportunity for success.\"\n\nThe Bears must overcome several obstacles to make the domed stadium on the lakefront a reality.\n\nThe first is ensuring a healthy, long-term relationship between the team and the park district. Given their rocky history, that bridge might be harder to cross than it sounds.\n\n\"I believe in people, I believe in relationships,\" Warren said about the park district-team relationship. \"And even since I've been able to be here and spend time with individuals at Soldier Field, individuals at the park district, individuals in the city of Chicago, I've only been welcomed. And we've had a great relationship. And I think people have seen that. They feel it. And I'm just confident that when you have a common goal that people can focus on and come together, I'm confident that we'll have a positive relationship as we go forward. And so one of the things I promised myself when I started on April 17 of last year was that I was going to understand and appreciate and embrace the history of the Chicago Bears and all the relationships. But any tension or negativity, I was not going to take it forward.\n\n\"And so I started from scratch. And I feel that we have not only great from a business relationship, but we've developed a personal relationship. And we work together very well. So I'm pleased with the way that it's gone. And I look forward to even building stronger relationships in the future. So that's an area that's not really a concern of mine.\"\n\nAs far as the thought that the lakefront project would require more than $1 billion in public infrastructure investment, Warren views the investment, whatever the number is, as good for the city of Chicago as it looks to compete against other cities in the marketplace.\n\n\"Those are things that we're working on. And one thing that I can guarantee you, I am fiscally conservative, and I am financially responsible,\" Warren said when asked about public funding. \"So anything that we recommend, from a financial standpoint, will be very well thought out.\"\n\nWarren cited a Sports Business Journal article that did not have Chicago in \"Top 25 Sports Business Cities\" as evidence that the investment is needed.\n\n\"But to think Chicago, you know, with this massive background, all the professional sports teams we have, the beautiful landscape, the topography, all those things involved, known for an incredible sports city. For us not to be on that list, from a business standpoint, those are the things that as a citizen of downtown Chicago and the state of Illinois, those are things from a business standpoint, concern me I look forward to the day that events like [the NFL league meetings] should and can be and will be held in downtown Chicago.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Parks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

The team plans to remain in Chicago despite invitations from a number of suburban municipalities to relocate outside the city limits.\n\nWhen the Bears' plans to build a new stadium as part of a mixed-use project on the 326-acre site of the former Arlington International Racecourse hit a snag, Taylor said she felt compelled to reach out to the team. The mayor said she felt it her invitation might at least lead to good exposure and potentially other development.\n\n\"We have to explore every opportunity for economic development,\" Taylor said. \"That's part of my job. Some manufacturing companies are looking at Waukegan because of the availability of water. We are in the very, very preliminary stages of talking.\"\n\nNot long after sending a letter to the Bears suggesting the team consider Waukegan, Taylor said a real estate company representing the team contacted her. They sent drones to look at proposed locations.\n\nBefore building their new Chicago home, the Bears must overcome skepticism from Gov. J.B. Pritzker, the Illinois General Assembly, watchdog groups like the Civic Federation and Friends of the Parks who successfully drove \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas away.\n\nThe proposed stadium itself would cost $3.2 billion, with another $1.4 billion in proposed infrastructure improvements, sources told the Tribune. The Bears are pledging an investment of $2.3 billion. The infrastructure work and remaining costs would be funded by tax dollars.\n\nSome of the proposed public funding would come from the sale of bonds by the Illinois Sports Facility Authority (ISFB), which is still carrying $619 million of debt for past Soldier Field renovations and construction of the White Sox Guaranteed Rate Field. The Bears want to increase the current 2% hotel tax currently going to the IFSB.\n\nAny funding from the ISFB requires approval by the state legislature. So far, some legislative leaders have not warmed to the Bears' suggested plans.\n\nShortly before Bears officials announced details of their plans, the governor said, \"I remain skeptical and I wonder whether it's a good deal. There are a lot of priorities and I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nJoe Ferguson, the president of the Civic Federation, said both the Bears and the Sox -- the baseball team is also looking at a new stadium near the Bears proposed site -- must show vetted cost and revenue projections.\n\n\"Everybody wants to keep the teams (in Chicago) -- the question is on what terms,\" Ferguson said. \"There's not a lot of information necessary to say one of these (plans) actually is viable, or whether it's a way to take us to the cleaners when we're already carrying hundreds of millions of dollars of debt for the last time we did something like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_sadin@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Steve Sadin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukegan,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waukegan, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waukegan, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Of course, they aren't planning to pay for it all themselves.\n\nThe team revealed reveal plans Wednesday for a $4.6 billion project to build a new enclosed stadium on the Lake Michigan lakefront area. The team is planning to pledge $2.025 billion to make it happen, leaving Illinois taxpayers on the hook for the remaining $2.6 billion.\n\nFor perspective, that works out to $183 per Illinois resident.\n\nThe Bears and the City of Chicago are pitching the project as three separate phases. Phase I is the stadium itself, which will cost $3.2 billion to build. Phase II consists of infrastructure improvements (public transportation, parking garages, parks) for the stadium and surrounding campus, which will cost $510 million. Phase III is for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million.\n\nThe Bears' $2 billion contribution to the stadium portion still leaves them $1.2 billion short. The rest will come from an already established 2% hotel tax, which will cover $900 million. The remaining $300 million will either come from an NFL loan or a source that's yet to be identified.\n\nWhile the financials for Phase I were explained in full, the funding for Phase II and Phase III were much less clear. The Bears did not say they would cover a single penny of the money required to complete the final two phases. The burden of paying for that will fall entirely on the taxpayers, whose money will be used to improve an area for the exclusive use and profit of the Bears.\n\nAnd they will be profiting. One rendering shows a massive row of luxury boxes stacked on top of each other, a row that runs across both sides of the stadium.\n\nGovernor J.B. Pritzker was not at the stadium announcement on Wednesday, but he did give a quote about the project. Mark him down as \"not a big fan.\"\n\nA $4.6 billion stadium (or a $3.2 billion stadium) would be the second-most expensive stadium in sports history, behind only SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers. That project was funded entirely by Rams owner Stan Kroenke.\n\nThese plans come after the Bears already spent $197 million to buy the Arlington International Racecourse property in Arlington Heights, Illinois. They are now apparently set to abandon those plans, with the team reportedly unable to reach an agreement over property taxes with local schools in Arlington Heights.\n\nThe Bears' lease at Soldier Field, which is nearing its 100th birthday, runs through 2033.\n\nThe Bears are pursuing their public funding in parallel to the Chicago White Sox, who have already unveiled plans for a stadium just outside Chicago's South Loop area.\n\nThe price tag was initially reported as $1 billion, but a subsequent interview by team owner Jerry Reinsdorf revealed the price tag would be closer to $2 billion. He heavily hinted that Illinois declining to cover the money would endanger the team's future in Chicago.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Bears will employ similar scare tactics, and if anyone would believe them. The teams have recently discussed a financial partnership.\n\nThe Bears and White Sox already had some financial ties, as they both received their most recent major rounds of funding for stadiums via the ISFA.\n\nA 2% hotel tax has been used to pay bonds that covered renovations for Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, but the debts have outpaced that income. Per the Tribune, taxpayers still owe $629 million on renovations for stadiums that both teams are now trying to abandon while asking Illinois to pay billions to help them do so.\n\nSome of the proposed borrowing would reportedly be used to roll over that debt, with a plan to pay it off over the course of 40 years.\n\nOne sports economist the Tribune spoke to, J.C.

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nHow many tickets are issued by traffic cameras in Davenport, LeClaire and Buffalo?

The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report. ___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Then they plead poverty.\n\nThat seems to be the case with the Chicago Bears as they pursue a brand new stadium in the Windy City.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, the Bears' $4.6 billion price tag on their new stadium features around half of the money coming from local tax payers - Bears fans and non-Bears fans alike. The price tag includes $3.2 billion in stadium construction costs plus another $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvements.\n\n\"The Chicago Bears are set to announce a $4.6 billion plan to build a new enclosed stadium and improved lakefront area with half of the money coming from taxpayers, sources said. But the team will have to overcome serious skepticism from several directions,\" the outlet wrote.\n\n\"The stadium itself would cost $3.2 billion to build, with another $1.4 billion in proposed infrastructure improvements, according to sources familiar with the plan who spoke to the Tribune on the condition of anonymity.\"\n\nPer the report, the Bears are ready to pledge $2.3 billion to the cause with the NFL financing some of the bill. However, the plan also calls for $2.3 billion in public financing along with debt refinancing. The final price tag for tax payers will reportedly be the entirety of the $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvements plus another $1 billion to finance a stadium for the MLB's Chicago White Sox.\n\n\"The sources said the Bears plan to pledge $2.3 billion, which includes some financing through the NFL. But the Bears' plan includes an additional $2.3 billion in public financing, along with refinancing outstanding debt for prior publicly financed stadium projects for the Bears and White Sox, according to the sources,\" the report continued.\n\n\"Taxpayers would be on the hook for the proposed infrastructure improvements along with about $1 billion in new borrowing to finance the new stadium south of Soldier Field, the sources said.\"\n\nJudging by the reaction on social media, this proposal isn't going to sit well with the city of Chicago. Fans are already admonishing the Bears for going to the city, hat in hand, when they're part of one of the richest sports leagues in the world.\n\nWe've seen an increasing trend of cities rejecting bids to have taxpayers foot the bill for new stadiums or stadium improvements even at the risk of teams relocating.\n\nWill the Bears get their wish from the city? Will they threaten to leave if they don't get their money?", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tzvi_machlin@postandcourier.com", "name": "Tzvi Machlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/a2/aa26d798-98c8-50ff-965d-42852252e291/66292abbf1930.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The team's lease there runs through 2033.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. in suburban Arlington Heights. The team envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre (131 hectare) tract of land some 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson has made it clear he wants to keep the team in the city.\n\n\"I have said all along that meaningful private investment and a strong emphasis on public benefit are my requirements for public-private partnerships in our city,\" Johnson said last month.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Of course, they aren't planning to pay for it themselves.\n\nThe team is planning to reveal plans for a $4.6 billion project to build a new enclosed stadium on the Lake Michigan lakefront area, according to the Chicago Tribune, with the team planning to pledge $2.3 billion to make it happen. That would leave Illinois taxpayers on the hook for $2.3 billion.\n\nFor perspective, that works out to $183 per Illinois resident.\n\nThe stadium itself will reportedly cost $3.2 billion to build, with another $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvements (think public transportation, parking garages, parks). Taxpayers would technically cover the infrastructure improvements and $1 billion in newly borrowed money, which would involve new bonds for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA).\n\nA $4.6 billion stadium (or a $3.2 billion stadium) would be the second-most expensive stadium in sports history, behind only SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers. That project was funded entirely by Rams owner Stan Kroenke.\n\nThese plans come after the Bears already spent $197 million to buy the Arlington International Racecourse property in Arlington Heights, Ill. They are now apparently set to abandon those plans, with the team reportedly unable to reach an agreement over property taxes with local schools in Arlington Heights.\n\nThe Bears' lease at Soldier Field, which is nearing its 100th birthday, runs through 2033.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox would also like $2 billion\n\nThe Bears are pursuing their public funding in parallel to the Chicago White Sox, which have already unveiled plans for a stadium just outside Chicago's South Loop area.\n\nThe price tag was initially reported as $1 billion, but a subsequent interview by team owner Jerry Reinsdorf revealed the price tag would be more around $2 billion. He heavily hinted that Illinois declining to cover the money would endanger the team's future in Chicago.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Bears will employ similar scare tactics, and if anyone would believe them. The teams have recently discussed a financial partnership.\n\nWait until you hear how much Illinois still owes for the last Bears and White Sox stadium projects\n\nThe Bears and White Sox already had some financial ties, as they both received their most recent major rounds of funding for stadiums via the ISFA.\n\nA 2% hotel tax has been used to pay bonds that covered renovations for Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, but the debts have outpaced that income. Per the Tribune, taxpayers still owe $629 million on renovations for stadiums that both teams are now trying to abandon while asking Illinois to pay billions to help them to do so.\n\nSome of the proposed borrowing would reportedly be used to roll over that debt, with a plan to pay it off over the course of 40 years.\n\nOne sports economist the Tribune spoke to, J.C. Bradbury, was skeptical of the plan, to say the least:\n\n\"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me,\" Bradbury said. \"The Bears aren't going to leave one of the most iconic football markets in the country. Tell the Bears to pay for their own damn stadium, and if they don't like it, to go jump in Lake Michigan.\"\n\nWe'll see if Illinois legislators have a similar reaction.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_baer@aol.com", "name": "Jack Baer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Kroenke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stan Kroenke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tff.fFl.Ci5Oh7zmm7bkSg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/527a9d6482ef08dca215a688fe901885", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday, a slide in the presentation clarified that number would be closer to $2.025 billion dollars. After that, the team would look to an NFL stadium program for a $300 million loan. That leaves a $900 million gap for the stadium financing itself. The Bears plan has them looking to a bond mechanism in the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority program to make up the difference.\n\nThe Bears said a 2% hotel tax that is already in place for the ISFA should be able to make up the $900 million they need from public funds.\n\nThere wasn't a clear answer as to where the team would get the $300 million for the infrastructure, however. Murphy said the team is still working with the state and looking into different funding sources.\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money: one to maximize infrastructure for the stadium and surrounding campus totaling $510, and another phase for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million. Add up all three phases, and it's over $2 billion in public money.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson said on Wednesday that the Bears' new plan to build a stadium in Chicago will not raise taxes on city residents.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said after the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there.

The athletic fields would provide a high-quality, safe place for the city's youth, especially those from nearby underserved neighborhoods, to gather and play sports.\n\nVisitors would be able to enjoy the lakefront via indoor and outdoor experiences. The plan features a three-acre promenade and plaza area which could include year-round food and beverage outlets, retail shops, a cultural attraction focused on sports and Soldier Field history. A publicly-owned hotel could also be included on the recreation and cultural campus.\n\nThe new stadium would continue the tradition on a site that has hosted Chicago's major civic, entertainment, sports and cultural events for 100 years.\n\n\"The Bears have been proud to call Chicago home for more than 100 years,\" said Bears chairman George H. McCaskey. \"Perhaps no other sports team embodies the character of the city it represents better than the Bears and Chicago. Our founder, George Halas, emphasized the importance of being a champion for Chicago. This has been part of the foundation of our organization. That is why we are excited to invest in the greatest city in the world through a stadium project and site improvements that will benefit Chicagoans and visitors.\"\n\nThe proposal includes a contemporary architectural design which complements the existing architecture featuring an enclosed, fixed roof; spectacular views of Chicago's skyline and lakefront; intimate seating for unparalleled sight lines and open spaces for congregating.\n\nThe stadium would be capable of hosting large-scale sporting events year-round, including Super Bowls and NCAA Final Fours as well as the world's most prominent entertainment acts. Those spectacles would unlock economic benefits for a variety of sectors within Chicago and the region, evidenced in part by the estimated $6.6 billion in direct fiscal tax impact produced nationwide in 2021 by the sports tourism sector of the economy, according to Sports Business Journal.\n\nRecent Super Bowls have reportedly generated $1.3 billion for Arizona in 2023, $234-478 million for Los Angeles County in 2022 and $572 million for South Florida in 2020. Recent Final Fours have produced $270 million for Houston in 2023, $106 million for Louisiana in 2022 and $80-100 million for Indianapolis in 2021.\n\n\"This is a beautiful day for the City of Chicago,\" said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. \"It really is, and as a lifelong Bears fan, it is an honor to be here to celebrate the Bears' commitment to remaining the *Chicago *Bears. This is going to reinvigorate the entire City of Chicago. It would be the crown jewel of the City of Chicago, and with this new project we are showing the world what Chicago is capable of.\"\n\nOther project benefits include a pedestrian mall and pavilion, a wider variety of food and beverage options, more public restrooms, and the preservation of Soldier Field's historic colonnades, which will remain accessible to fans and continue to honor the men and women who served in our nation's military.\n\nThe Bears have pledged to contribute more than $2 billion to the project-over 70% of the total stadium cost. The remaining stadium funds are proposed to come from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA), a government entity that was created by the Illinois General Assembly in 1987 for the purpose of constructing and renovating sports stadiums for professional teams in the state of Illinois. The Bears' proposal can be accomplished with the existing 2% hotel tax used to back ISFA bonds.\n\n\"We are committing over $2 billion into a public/private partnership that will be transcendent for the city and bring opportunities and positive outcomes to millions of people who both live in Chicago and visit Chicago,\" said Karen Murphy, Bears executive vice president of stadium development and chief operating officer.\n\nThe Burnham Park Project includes a commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The Stadium Project DEI program is designed to provide equitable access and opportunities to the diverse community throughout the city and state. It includes a four-phase approach to formalize efforts to develop and implement workforce, business and community goals, standards and expectations alongside key partners from inception through completion and beyond.\n\nThe DEI plan includes the Bears formalizing partnerships with key experts and organizations, beginning with city and state governments and community-based entities representing women as well as Black and Hispanic people.\n\nThe construction of a publicly owned stadium and associated Burnham Park improvements would be one of the largest building projects in the region's history, representing $4.2 billion of direct capital investment while creating opportunities for a regional workforce.\n\nThe project would boast over $8 billion in regional construction economic impact, a $456 million annual economic impact post construction, the creation of 43,000 regional construction jobs and 4,200 permanent jobs post construction. Annual tax revenue from ongoing operations is projected to be 58% higher for the City of Chicago and 41% for the state of Illinois with the replacement stadium over the current operation of Soldier Field.\n\n\"This is a big day for the City of Chicago and our dynamic business community,\" said Charles Smith, vice chair of World Business Chicago. \"Chicago is the best place in the world to do business. Economic development serves as an engine driving our city toward a promising future. And when executed thoughtfully, it has the potential to extend opportunities to every corner of our city.\"\n\nThe plan also involves the easing of traffic circulation in the area via:\n\nImproved ramps and interchanges at 18th Street. A new parking deck built on an existing surface lot. Improved access to DuSable Lake Shore Drive via a new overpass, relocation of a Lake Shore Drive exit and new ramps to the campus. A new lower level for McFetridge Drive.\n\nThe changes are expected to result in a 50% increase in campus capacity for events, a 10- to 20-minute reduction in event exit times, and 1,200 vehicle hours of congestion removed on an average day at the intersection of DuSable Lake Shore Drive and McFetridge Drive.\n\nThe infrastructure plan for the project is split into three phases. Phase 1 consists of requirements to open the stadium including transportation, roadways and utilities, and would cost an estimated $325 million. Phase 2 would maximize the stadium and surrounding campus, cost $510 million and include a bus depot expansion, new parks and playfields. Phase 3 would further enhance the campus, cost $665 million and consist of additional transportation improvements, retail and public attractions.\n\nThe Bears are aiming to break ground in the summer of 2025, with a planned grand opening in the summer of 2028.\n\nTo stay up to date on news and information regarding the stadium project, visit StadiumforChicago.com.", "source": {"uri":

On Wednesday, a slide in the presentation clarified that number would be closer to $2.025 billion dollars. After that, the team would look to an NFL stadium program for a $300 million loan. That leaves a $900 million gap for the stadium financing itself. The Bears plan has them looking to a bond mechanism in the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority program to make up the difference.\n\nThe Bears said a 2% hotel tax that is already in place for the ISFA should be able to make up the $900 million they need from public funds.\n\nThere wasn't a clear answer as to where the team would get the $300 million for the infrastructure, however. Murphy said the team is still working with the state and looking into different funding sources.\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money: one to maximize infrastructure for the stadium and surrounding campus totaling $510 million, and another phase for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million. Add up all three phases plus the IFSA funding, and it's nearly $2.4 billion in public money.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson said on Wednesday that the Bears' new plan to build a stadium in Chicago will not raise taxes on city residents.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said after the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nIt's still not clear where some of the funding will come from. Additionally, the Bears indicated they could potentially look for city money as well as state and federal dollars.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there.

While the team would put up over $2 billion of the $3.2 billion needed to build the stadium, it's also seeking $1.5 billion in infrastructure support over several years to realize its vision for a multi-use public park space on Chicago's lakefront Museum Campus.\n\nChicago Bears president and CEO Kevin Warren said the $2 billion committed by the Bears would be the largest private investment in Chicago history. He also said a new stadium can provide thousands of temporary and long-term jobs for Chicagoans. Warren joined the Bears in early 2023 after previously brokering a deal to bring the Minnesota Vikings a new stadium with a public-private partnership in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Look around Chicago, I know the mayor is doing all that he can with his leadership to lean in to get economic development going,\" Warren said. \"We want to be that catalyst.\"\n\nDespite that major commitment, Bears executives sought to fill an estimated $900 million \"gap\" through state funding via a bond from the Illinois Sports Facility Authority, a state agency created in the 1980s to finance new sports stadiums. The team also proposed using the city's existing hotel tax and restructuring ISFA's current debt over a 40-year period.\n\nWhile the proposal represents the largest private commitment of any of the recent pushes by professional sports teams for a new stadium yet, it was quickly met with skepticism by Gov. JB Pritzker, who was at a concurrent news conference at Loyola University Chicago.\n\n\"I'm highly skeptical of the proposal that's been made and I believe strongly that this is not a high priority for legislators, and certainly not for me when I compare it to all the other things,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe governor downplayed the competing news conferences. He'd scheduled his in advance to highlight health insurance reforms that recently cleared the House with his support. The Bears' announcement was scheduled within the past two days.\n\nPart of the proposal includes developing about 15 acres of recreational park space for public use and more stadium vendor businesses owned by women and people of color. Johnson hailed the project for upholding his \"criteria for any new development project.\"\n\n\"We require real private investment, real public use and real economic participation for the entire city,\" he said.\n\nHe noted no new taxes would be imposed on Chicago residents and the city can expect \"increased tax revenue from this investment, expanded public recreation, stronger economic growth for the entire city of Chicago for generations to come.\"\n\nTeam leaders claimed in their presentation that the stadium would create over 40,000 construction jobs and over 4,000 permanent jobs.\n\nThe Bears' presentation noted the organization was seeking about $1.5 billion in three phases of infrastructure investment that could come \"at the state level, at the potentially federal level, potentially at the city level,\" according to Warren, who gave no specifics.\n\nKaren Murphy, the team's executive vice president of stadium development and chief operating officer, said that includes $325 million in transportation, roadway and utility improvements that would be needed to open the stadium.\n\nThe remaining funding - at least $1.1 billion - would come over a period of at least five years. That could include $510 million in a second phase of construction for things such as parking upgrades and building surrounding parks and ballfields, followed by $665 million for further attractions and transportation improvements in a third phase. Bears representatives said those estimates are subject to change.\n\nPritzker mentioned \"higher priorities for the state\" than building a football stadium, including his $4.4 million proposed investment in birth equity centers to create a statewide plan and distribute building grants. And he noted Missouri voters rejected a stadium funding plan for the reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and for the Kansas City Royals baseball team.\n\n\"The problem is that the offer that they've made just isn't one that I think the taxpayers are interested in getting engaged in,\" Pritzker said of the proposal, later adding, \"We've seen this fail over and over across the United States.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch, D-Hillside, who attended the governor's news conference at Loyola, said he gave Warren a blunt assessment when they recently met privately.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably. There is no environment for something like this today,\" he said.\n\nSenate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, also expressed skepticism in a statement.\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer,\" he said. \"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"\n\nAs for the bonding authority sought by the Bears, Pritzker noted three pro sports teams are seeking money through the ISFA for a new stadium - the Bears, the Chicago White Sox baseball team and the Chicago Red Stars women's soccer team.\n\n\"And this is one team that is offering to take all of the tax revenue for their stadium and there apparently is nothing left over for the other two teams,\" Pritzker said.\n\nWhile Pritzker had not been briefed on the proposal prior to Wednesday's news conference, Warren said team representatives \"look forward to having some detailed conversations with the state here in the near future.\"\n\n\"Today was the first day that we have been able to publicly roll out our plan,\" he said. \"It's very difficult for someone to say they're against this and we just presented it, so we look forward to having more conversations with individuals in Springfield.\"\n\nWhen pressed by media at the Loyola event as to whether there was a \"path\" for him to support a subsidy plan, Pritzker responded \"sure,\" but with a caveat.\n\n\"This has got to be a lot better for taxpayers than what they put forward. That's all I'm saying,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "wglt.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "wglt.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Park_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Park District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Vikings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Team aims to stay in Chicago", "body": "Where will the Bears play during potential new stadium construction? Team aims to stay in Chicago originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago\n\nDuring a press conference at Soldier Field, Kevin Warren and the Bears unveiled their plans for a new stadium along Chicago's lakefront on Wednesday.\n\nWarren, while answering a question about when they plan to file a legislative bill, said he hopes the stadium is ready to play in 2028. He wants to get things underway immediately, passing the legislation necessary to begin construction. Warren estimates 36 months are necessary for the total construction of the stadium.\n\nBut where would the Bears play during the construction of their new stadium? They plan to remain in Chicago.\n\n\"One of the things that makes this project unique is that we would be able to continue to play at Soldier Field during the construction and then be able to move into the new stadium once the construction is finalized,\" Warren said. \"So yes, we would be able to continue to play here and not have to move to a different location which is really imperative especially where we are in our growth cycle as a football franchise.\"\n\nThe Bears' commitment to remaining in the city of Chicago permanently, as opposed to constructing a stadium in the suburbs, undoubtedly allows them to remain at Soldier Field until construction is complete.\n\nObviously, there's the prerequisite of needing legislative approval for the stadium plan in its entirety before the Bears can talk about temporary locations. But because Warren has a strong relationship with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, that allows them to stick around in Soldier Field during the construction.\n\nUsually, teams often borrow college or other professional sports fields during the construction of their respective stadiums. The Bears have played at Illinois' Memorial Field during the respective renovations of Soldier Field in 2003, for example.\n\nBut the Bears plan to remain at Soldier Field until the construction is completed at the new stadium.\n\nAs for Soldier Field's fate --- if the new stadium is built --- it'll be knocked down, according to the Bears' plans. In the renderings the team released on Wednesday, the team plans to knock down Soldier Field for 14 acres of green area. They will, however, keep the columns and historical details of the stadium.\n\n\"Sports fields and gardens will replace the current stadium, with Soldier Field's historic colonnades preserved as a tribute to Chicago's military veterans,\" the team said in a release. \"An enclosed stadium is essential for Chicago to attract year-round events like the Super Bowl and major concerts -- unlocking billions in tourism revenue.\"\n\n\"As you noticed here, the plan is to keep the historical columns from Soldier Field to make that part of this development to make it one museum campus,\" Bears CEO/President Kevin Warren said during a visual presentation of the renderings. \"What happens here is the additional open and green space. This will have 14 acres of athletic fields, a recreational park to allow, as I mentioned earlier, for youth to be able to come together and do things in a productive manner.\"\n\nSoldier Field earned historical landmark status in 1987 but lost its status in 2006 as a result of renovations made to the stadium in 2003. That means demolition is viable for the stadium, should the Bears earn approval to do so.\n\nCheck out the remains of Soldier Field in the new renderings.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Manitoba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Manitoba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Manitoba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QFHW8ze7YJMU.TNqTidAtg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/a0a9189c1f9a64a29454ccd218307166", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The team and the city said the project would add green and open space while improving access to the city's Museum Campus and could also include a publicly owned hotel.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\nThe announcement at Soldier Field comes during a busy week for the Bears. They are expected to take 2022 Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the draft on Thursday night and bank on the USC quarterback to solidify a position that has long been a sore spot for the founding NFL franchise.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report. ___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This April 24, the Bears organization will be hosting a press conference to announce their plans for a new publicly owned stadium, per WGN Radio 720's Kevin Powell. The upcoming facility reportedly includes additional green and open spaces with access to the lakefront area on Museum Campus.\n\nThis comes amid the Bears' recent shift of location plans from Arlington Heights to the Chicago lakefront. Last year, the organization purchased Arlington Park, a former horse racing track, for nearly $200 million. While they already began demolition of the existing structures on the site, a property tax dispute suddenly sprouted up as an obstacle.\n\nLakefront it is then. Assuming nothing goes wrong this time and the upcoming stadium is completed, the Bears will be saying goodbye to Soldier Field -- their home for a little over five decades. Plenty of special moments have been made there. From Walter Payton's record-breaking rush to the '85 Bears championship season, the NFL's smallest stadium holds big memories for longtime fans.\n\nOf course, a new stadium will still take years to build, so the Bears have time for finish their Soldier Field tenure on a high note. They could possibly do that this coming season, looking the team's offseason activity.\n\nThe two biggest acquisitions during free agency were arguably Keenan Allen and D'Andre Swift. Allen's resume needs no explanation. A household name for the Los Angeles Chargers, Allen is expected to wreak havoc alongside DJ Moore this coming season.\n\nThen there's Swift. As the Philadelphia Eagles' leading RB last year, Swift heads to Chicago to join a loaded offense that's awaiting one last piece: A quarterback.\n\nFor any fan who's been up to date with the headlines, he would surely know that the Bears are expected to take college sensation Caleb Williams as this year's number one draft pick. This became more imminent when the team traded Justin Fields away to the Pittsburgh Steelers. If all goes as projected and the 2022 Heisman winner lands in Chicago, then the Bears' 2024 offense is definitely one to look out for.\n\nThe defensive side of the ball also gained reinforcements, particularly in the secondary area. Jonathan Owens and two-time All-Pro Kevin Byard are expected to add depth alongside Jaquan Brisker at the safety position.\n\nFor a team rich in history, the recent years have not been kind to the Bears organization. Last year, Chicago finished their season with a 7-10 record, marking the third straight season with no playoff appearance. Nevertheless, if there's one thing this offseason showed, it's that the team wants to compete, and their current roster looks to be one that will.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_buyawe@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brian Buyawe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN_(AM)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WGN (AM)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Andre_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D'Andre Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walter Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keenan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keenan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaquan_Brisker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaquan Brisker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Byard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Byard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena_and_Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Arena and Indoor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Bears-news-Chicago-preparing-bombshell-new-stadium-announcement.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 115}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The mayor is expected to speak at the event, championing the team's renewed interest in Chicago since he became mayor.\n\nThe public portion of the stadium costs would be provided by bonds issued by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority under the plan, the state and city agency that still has outstanding debt tied to the 2003 Soldier Field renovations and what is now Guaranteed Rate Field.\n\nTo retire the existing debt and issue new bonds -- which would be repaid over 40 years -- the team will need state legislators to extend the ISFA's authority beyond its current 2033 mandate and increase its bonding capacity.\n\nThe length of the debt repayments and the costs associated with refinancing the agency's current debt will likely cost billions more over time than the roughly $1 billion provided to the Bears upfront to build the new stadium.\n\nIt's unclear what tax revenue beyond an existing 2% tax on hotel stays in Chicago would be used to back the bonds.\n\nThe plan is complicated by the White Sox own stadium pursuit. The team is seeking roughly $1 billion to build a new ballpark at Related Midwest's The 78 development in the South Loop.\n\nNeither team's current plan would provide funding for the other team's new stadium, but the two parties have been meeting to brainstorm ideas to avoid asking legislators to approve separate financing packages.\n\nIn order to both extinguish the agency's current debt while providing the capital needed to build stadiums for both the Bears and Chicago White Sox, additional tax subsidies are likely required. The Sox are seeking more than $1 billion for a South Loop ballpark at The 78.\n\nComplicating the financial basics the Bears will provide is whether state lawmakers will consider separate proposals from the Bears and the White Sox. State Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, told the teams to work together to present a single package.\n\nThe city recently shot down an idea from the White Sox to dedicate revenue from the city's tax on ticket sales at the new stadiums to the pot. If Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf is willing to pony up his own cash to make the deal work, which he has now signaled he would do \"under the right conditions,\" the stadium math could become feasible.\n\nThe Bears lakefront stadium pursuit is further complicated by the threat of a lawsuit from park advocacy group Friends of the Parks, which previously helped block a museum pushed by \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas at the same site the Bears want to build the stadium.\n\nThe Bears' contribution\n\nThe $2.2 billion won't come in the form of a check from the McCaskey family, but a complicated mix of loans and future revenue streams that can be borrowed against to begin construction.\n\nThe bulk of the money will come from revenue raised through marketing opportunities at the new stadium, including corporate naming rights and two tranches of loans from the NFL. The team also hopes to raise hundreds of millions through the sale of personal seat licenses to fans hoping to become season ticket holders.\n\nAccess to some of those revenue streams will need to be enshrined in the team's lease of the stadium, which will continue to be owned by the Chicago Park District. Johnson has signaled in frequent meetings with Warren that the city is ready to provide much more favorable lease terms than the Bears current agreement to play at Soldier Field.\n\nThe team relied on the sales of personal seat licenses to help fund the renovation of Soldier Field. NFL teams have raised big sums for stadium construction in the past from such licenses, which are expensive one-time purchases that give their owners the right to buy season tickets each year.\n\nThe Bears sold PSLs ranging from $765 to $8,500 that collectively raised more than $50 million toward the $690 million renovation of Soldier Field -- licenses whose value would evaporate should the team move out. But experts have pegged PSL rates at a new Bears stadium to dwarf those for Soldier Field, with the most expensive seats in a new stadium potentially fetching as much as $100,000 apiece.\n\nSuch charges would test Bears supporters' financial willingness to help foot the stadium bill for a team that has seemingly inelastic demand for its product, but years of mostly middling performance on the field and gripes that many fans are priced out of attending games.\n\nThe Bears for months have touted downtown Chicago as the team's focus for a new stadium, though the franchise hasn't entirely stopped its pursuit of a stadium-anchored mixed-use campus in Arlington Heights.\n\nPrevious plans in Arlington Heights\n\nA venture controlled by the team paid $197 million early last year for the shuttered, 326-acre Arlington International Racecourse property, where it unveiled plans in September 2022 for a $5 billion stadium and entertainment district. Led at the time by now-retired President and CEO Ted Phillips, the Bears said they would only move ahead with the redevelopment if they could secure taxpayer help financing the mixed-use portion of the proposed campus.\n\nBut plenty has changed since then to slow and potentially stall that effort. Warren took the reins as CEO in January 2023, bringing a fresh perspective on the team's stadium strategy. In June, amid an apparent struggle to see eye-to-eye with Arlington Heights school districts about future property taxes at the Arlington Park property, the Bears said the project was \"at risk\" and that the team was entertaining conversations with other locations in the Chicago area for a possible stadium project.\n\nJohnson had also just taken office, creating an opportunity for the team to reset a relationship with City Hall that had become contentious under former Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Warren said in September that the team wouldn't pursue state legislation during the fall legislative session that would help subsidize its Arlington Heights project, and he continued to send signals that a downtown stadium project would be the team's focus.\n\nIn the meantime, the Bears have been taking steps to try to reduce its property tax bill in Arlington Heights, most recently filing a request to the Illinois Property Appeals Board to reevaluate the 2023 assessed value of the property. The Bears have said that a struggle to find middle ground with school districts in the area about what the site is worth has been a major deterrent for the project.", "source": {"uri":

By announcing the stadium plan the day before, it will get a tremendous amount of attention locally and also nationally and internationally,\" Ganis said.\n\n\"Tens of millions of people around the country are going to see the renderings and the plans for the new stadium. The attention that it will receive will be dramatic -- all because they have the No. 1 pick. It wouldn't be the same if they had the No. 2 pick,\" Ganis added.\n\n\"If everything goes as hoped,\" he added, April 24 and April 25 will become \"seminal dates\" in Bears history -- \"taking the quarterback that they hope will be their franchise star leading them to Super Bowls for many years to come and the stadium that will be the first that the team will ever have built and designed themselves.\"\n\nThe Bears have already committed to investing more than $2 billion in private money to build a stadium south of Soldier Field whose total cost, sources said, could easily approach $3.5 billion. But among the questions to be answered Wednesday is how the team plans to fill that $1.5 billion construction funding gap. They also need to explain how they would deconstruct much of Soldier Field while preserving the historic colonnades and other original aspects of the stadium, which was dedicated as a war memorial. And, they must outline where the money will. come from for $1 billion worth of infrastructure improvements needed to make the lakefront more accessible.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson already has cracked the door open to a potential public subsidy to help the Bears, just as he has for the White Sox plans for a new ballpark at the vacant South Loop parcel known as \"the 78.\"\n\nJohnson's decision to attend Wednesday's Soldier Field unveiling could be a sign he's prepared to put the city's money where his mouth is, even if progressive voters who helped put him on office ultimately question his spending priorities.\n\n\"So far, it hasn't cost him anything. This has been an easy support of a local business that is very popular. ... He's been saying the right things. Good relationship. Want to keep the Bears in [Chicago], but there has to be public benefit,\" Ganis said.\n\n\"The relationship with the Bears -- it was toxic while [Lori] Lightfoot was mayor. And it has significantly improved\" under Johnson.\n\nLast month, the Bears held their first meeting with the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, the state agency they want to help finance their lakefront dome.\n\nFrank Bilecki, that agency's executive director, said Warren was eyeing the same portion of city's hotel tax the White Sox hope to use to build a new, $1.5 billion stadium in the South Loop.\n\nPlans outlined at that time by the Bears included \"a potential hotel, but not a specific location for the hotel,\" Bilecki said. \"There were playing fields for other sports and activities in the area where Soldier Field is now. ... Restaurants and bars were also mentioned, depending on financing. There was a Hall of Fame area as well,\" Bilecki told the Sun-Times after that meeting.\n\nThe bigger the hotel and entertainment district surrounding a lakefront stadium, the more tax revenue it will generate to help finance the project. But there's a catch. The more the team proposes to build on the lakefront, the bigger the legal target for Friends of the Parks, the advocacy group that has long served as the lakefront's primary protector.\n\nFriends of the Parks, which Ganis called \"very formidable and very committed,\" is a force to be reckoned with. Just ask movie mogul George Lucas, who once hoped to build his interactive museum on the same Soldier Field parking lot the Bears now covet.\n\n\"While I have lived here -- and it's been decades -- it's hard to think of anything that's been built east of Lake Shore Drive that impacted the Lakefront Protection Ordinance other than the renovation of Soldier Field and the parking lot next to it,\" Ganis said.\n\n\"When Friends of the Parks was able to block a fully-funded museum from being built east of Lake Shore Drive, it said a lot about their influence and their commitment.\"\n\nThe Bears apparently have abandoned plans to build a domed stadium on the 326-acre site of the old Arlington International Racecourse -- after spending $197.2 million to acquire it. The team had expressed disappointment at failing to secure a large enough property tax break on that land. Local school districts opposed a lower assessment, saying it would shortchange students.\n\n\"None of this would be an issue if the taxing bodies in Arlington Heights didn't get greedy,\" Ganis said.\n\nWith the spring legislative session entering a critical juncture, the Bears and Sox have intensified negotiations to hammer out a joint financing package to divide the bonding capacity and plug funding gaps.\n\nNo increase is contemplated in the hotel room tax. Chicago's already is among the nation's highest, Bilecki has said.\n\nBut both teams, he added, also understand that revenue from that tax can't fund two new stadiums and also pay off old stadium debts -- \"which, I assume, is part of the ongoing discussion between the teams. That's up to them to try and figure out. ... It's the million-dollar question. \"\n\nThat outstanding debt includes the bonds used to pay for the 2003 Soldier Field renovation. Those bonds also have balloon payments at the end; payments go from $56.7 million this year to a final payment of $90.5 million in 2032.\n\nAnother $50 million in outstanding bonds issued by Bilecki's agency were used to fund renovations to Guaranteed Rate Field, where the White Sox play now. Those bonds won't be retired until 2029, when the baseball team's lease expires.\n\nWhenever hotel tax revenue fails to grow at 5.5% a year, Chicago taxpayers must make up the difference. That's happened three times, and twice in the last three years. The biggest deficit was $27.3 million in 2022.\n\nThe Sox financing plan for the South Loop parcel calls for all $589.1 million -- including $375 million in principal and $214 million in interest -- to be paid off by a 35-to-40-year extension of IFSA bonds, also backed by the hotel tax.\n\nThe Sox also hope to create a \"sales tax overlay district\" that would require the city, state and count to forfeit a portion of sales tax revenue generated within the boundaries of the 78. That revenue would primarily serve as a backup to guarantee that bond holders are \"taken care of when there are outlier events like COVID or 9/11\" that cause hotel tax revenues to plummet,\" Bailey told the Sun-Times last month.\n\nIt was not known immediately known whether the Bears plan to use the sales and amusement tax growth generated by their proposed lakefront development to help bankroll the stadium project.\n\nBut the team is expected to generate its $2 billion contribution to the project by selling naming rights to the new stadium, selling a far more expensive version of the personal seat licenses that bankrolled the renovation of the existing Soldier Field and by openin a stadium sportsbook and tapping a forgiveable loan from the National Football League for hundreds of millions of dollars.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field",

But more importantly, also revealed how they'd like the stadium to look, assuming it does get built.\n\nInstead of the open air Soldier Field, the new building would have a dome to shelter Bears fans from the elements.\n\nAccording to the team, the stadium would also include \"14 acres of new athletic fields and recreational park space,\" which would \"provide Chicago families with a place to gather and play.\"\n\nReplacing the aging Soldier Field has long been a priority for the Bears organization as the facility continues to decline and the franchise looks to increase revenues in a new, more desirable building.\n\nBut how likely is it that this new project gets built?\n\nThe new stadium is projected to cost between $2.5 billion to $3 billion, and the organization is reportedly set to contribute roughly $2 billion of the cost themselves, in their eminent generosity.\n\nThere could also be an additional $1 billion in infrastructure and road improvement costs that would need to be covered. How the remaining costs are covered is essentially an open question. Though as has become common with sports stadiums in the modern era, it's likely they'd ask for public funding. Which has become increasingly hard to come by, especially with MLB's White Sox also hoping to get public money to build a new stadium.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson signaled his support for the lakefront dome stadium, though also said the city had not committed financial backing.\n\n\"If we're going to build 21st-century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire city of Chicago, and these conversations, particularly with the Bears, have been quite positive,\" Johnson said according to Front Office Sports. \"I appreciate the leadership of [team president] Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nRenderings of the new facility look great, and would be an upgrade over Soldier Field. But stadium projects have become a much steeper uphill climb as the public realizes stadiums rarely present sound financial investments.

The move builds materially on the Bears' announced intent last month to stay in the city of Chicago after a lengthy tour of alternate options across the area suburbs.\n\nLike any other stadium project, there is still a very long way to go between an event like this press conference and an actual opening. But this latest step does show the depth of the Bears' desire to hone in on this particular location after initial resistance surfaced from two local preservation groups as well as in Arlington Heights, where the Bears previously intended to build the stadium..\n\nAnd also like many other stadium projects, there are still significant questions about financing of the Bears' project. The stadium itself is projected to cost between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, with perhaps another $1 billion going toward roads and infrastructure improvements. The Bears have pledged $2 billion toward the effort. There have been talks about a potential \"financing partnership\" with the White Sox in which both teams would take a more collaborative approach to help ensure their respective efforts to build new stadiums get done.\n\nBut how that remaining funding gap is filled, presumably with some form of taxpayer assistance, will be a critical factor -- particularly given that there is no deal in place with either the city of Chicago or the state of Illinois.\n\n\"If we're going to build 21st-century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire of Chicago, and these conversations, particularly with the Bears, have been quite positive,\" Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson said last week. \"I appreciate the leadership of [team president] Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nThe Bears' stadium saga remains one of the most closely watched issues across the NFL, as well as the rest of the sports industry. Despite being the country's third-largest media market, Chicago, for years, has been shut out of hosting major events such as the Super Bowl and Final Four, as it does not have a large-scale domed stadium.\n\nThe White Sox, meanwhile, are facing some resistance in their efforts to build a successor facility to Guaranteed Rate Field, and do so closer to downtown Chicago. Johnson recently vetoed an idea of using the city's amusement tax for either the Bears' stadium project or the one advanced by White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, and added that the MLB team owner needs to \"put some skin in the game.\"\n\nTo that end, Crain's Chicago Business reported that Reinsdorf is prepared to pay at least $200 million toward the project. But with initial cost estimates for the White Sox stadium hovering around $1.2 billion -- a figure likely to escalate -- a significant funding gap remains there, too.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_fisher@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Eric Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crain's_Chicago_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crain's Chicago Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/USATSI_17391534_168393969_lowres-scaled-e1692988843780.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

This means billions of tourism dollars that Chicago currently cannot capture -- helping our city regain its reputation for hosting global events.\"\n\nThe noontime VIP event at the United Club inside Soldier Field -- attended by Chicago city officials and a throng of media -- was hosted by Warren, Bears Chairman George McCaskey and other top team brass and consultants. They unveiled sketches of an enclosed stadium on Soldier Field's south parking lot and additional green space on the surrounding Museum Campus.\n\nIt mirrored a presentation McCaskey and then-team President Ted Phillips made at John Hersey High School in Arlington Heights in September 2022, when renderings for a domed stadium and adjoining mixed-use district at Arlington Park were revealed. The team closed on its purchase of the 326-acre property in February 2023.\n\nBut since Phillips retired and Warren took the helm, the NFL franchise has shifted its focus away from the suburbs and back to the city.\n\nThe Wednesday reveal came on the eve of one of the biggest NFL Draft nights in history for the Bears, who hold the first overall pick and appear poised to select USC quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nTouchdown Arlington, the pro-Bears-to-Arlington Heights business coalition, was set to host its latest letter-writing party at Jimmy D's District sports bar on draft night to urge three Arlington Heights-area school boards to reach agreement with the Bears on a yearlong property tax dispute.\n\nBut amid the release of the city stadium plans, group organizers decided to postpone their event to gather more information.\n\nIn an email to supporters, Touchdown Arlington leaders wrote that they still believe an Arlington Heights stadium is very much on the table, since there are significant issues facing the proposed development on the lakefront. They include funding, opposition from local groups, public ownership of the stadium, and a lack of public interest in contributing taxpayer dollars to the project.\n\nThe Bears so far have received a tepid response in Springfield for authorization to extend Illinois Sports Facilities Authority bonds, backed by the 2% Chicago hotel tax, that could help bankroll the redevelopment. The Chicago White Sox are seeking the same pot of money, amid other potential financing mechanisms, for a new ballpark at The 78 redevelopment in the South Loop.\n\nFor more on this developing story,

That stadium was delivered under budget, was paid off 20 years early and is regarded as one of the top venues in the world. Kevin and the team he has assembled will put Chicago in a position to have similar results.\"\n\nJohnson praised the team's commitment to the city, calling its plan to invest more than $2 billion in the project \"one of the largest private investments in the city's history\" and stressed that there would be \"no new taxes\" or existing taxes raised on Chicago residents to generate the public investment. He and Warren both referenced Daniel Burnham's storied \"Plan of Chicago\" during the presentation, noting the stadium project \"reimagines the entire museum campus in a way that truly realizes\" Burnham's vision.\n\nJohnson: \"It gives us an opportunity to enjoy this campus in a far more collaborative way. This will include access to innovative retail and hospitality offerings provided by talented local entrepreneurs form all the neighborhoods. . . .We hope to use this new stadium to host several year-round events, including Chicago Public Schools championships, graduations, major concerts, Final Fours, Big Ten Championships. . . .This is going to reinvigorate the entire city of Chicago. It will be the crown jewel of the city of Chicago.\"\n\nJohnson touted his role in helping turn the Bears' attention back to a city stadium project after its efforts in Arlington Heights:\n\n\"It is worth remembering how different things were a year ago,\" he said. \"Kevin wasn't president (of the Bears), I wasn't mayor of the city of Chicago and the Bears were reportedly as good as gone. In fact, I think I was the only mayoral candidate to express the willingness to even try to keep them in Chicago. And now, here it is a year later. Kevin is the president of the Bears, I'm the mayor of the city of Chicago and the Bears are committed to staying in Chicago.\"\n\nWarren spoke about the stadium design from Kansas City-based Manica Architecture, the same firm that drew up plans for Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. He described the venue as \"very contemporary\" with a fixed, translucent roof similar to the one at that stadium and U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. \"You'll get all the benefits of being indoors, but you'll feel like you're outdoors,\" he said. The northern end of the stadium would be enclosed with glass with a view of the Chicago skyline, and Warren said the enclosed stadium could help encourage musical acts to make bigger commitments to Chicago during tours.\n\nWarren: \"There are many entertainers who would look toward coming to our stadium to be able to do an in-house residency. Instead of coming for two days, they may come for 20 days. There's so much we can do here from a concert standpoint.\"\n\nWarren on the project's potential to be a \"catalyst\" for economic development in the city, with an estimate that it would create 43,000 construction jobs:\n\n\"I want us to get beyond picking on what's wrong with this project, (and) instead say what's right with it. Because our people need an opportunity to go to work and take care of their families.\"\n\nWarren on the team's request for $900 million in bond financing from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority to help pay for the stadium project:\n\nTo help fund new infrastructure for the venue, \"there are dollars that we believe exist at the state level, at potentially the federal level, potentially at the city level. On the costs of the actual stadium. . . .We're looking for $900 million from ISFA. They were designed to fund stadiums. All we're asking for is for ISFA to be able to do what they were put in place to do. That's why the mayor was able to say we're not talking about any increase in taxes.\"\n\nBears Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Stadium Development Karen Murphy stressed the team's push to move forward with the project as soon as possible, and said Infrastructure pieces of the project could happen over a period of about five years.\n\nMurphy: \"Now is the time to act. There is a significant cost to waiting. . . .The cost to maintain (Soldier Field) gets more and more expensive each year. Every year we wait, due to the cost of inflation, that funding gap that's now $900 million will go up (by more than) $150 million.\"\n\nChicago Chief Financial Officer Jill Jaworski said refinancing ISFA's debt with new bonds would help the city financially because it would provide more in reserves and would include a more conservative hotel tax revenue growth projection. Due to a lack of hotel stays during the COVID-19 pandemic, city taxpayers have had to chip in to help cover ISFA's bond payments.\n\nJaworski: \"We think we have less risk under (the Bears') scenario than we have right now,\" she said. \"We expect that, without a refinancing, (hotel tax shortfalls) would hit the city budget every year at an increasing amount. Refinancing (the ISFA debt) with a more conservative structure insulates us more and reduces our risk going forward.\"\n\nWarren on the team turning its attention away from a stadium plan in Arlington Heights:\n\n\"We are the largest land owner in Arlington Heights. We own a beautiful piece of land. But we've said it before, and after today we're clear, that our focus is on the city of Chicago and this muesum campus area. We still own the land, but our focus from a stadium development project is here.\"\n\nJohnson on why he thinks the stadium is an appropriate use of lakefront land, given rules preventing private development east of Lake Shore Drive:\n\n\"Because of 20% more open space that will be available for the people of Chicago.... Creating the open space, better access to the museums, providing better traffic flow in and out, creating jobs, making opportunities for our young people... I'm fully confident that it works within the confines of an ordinance.\"\n\nJohnson did not directly answer when asked whether the city would be prepared to spend taxpayer resources defending a legal challenge to the plan, perhaps from lakefront advocacy group Friends of the Parks. \"What we're prepared to do is to continue to invest in people. We're prepared to put 23,000 (or) 24,000 people in Chicago to work,\" he said.\n\nWarren on the urgency of getting state legislators to sign off on the new bond financing:\n\n\"We feel that the time is now. Every year that we wait, it's $150 million to $200 million of increased cost that, ultimately, we'll have to figure out. . . .If we're approved in May, that would allow us to start construction and put people to work next summer. That would be 36 months (of construction) to open up a building in 2028. This truly is one of those adages that 'time is money.' We do need to figure this out.\"\n\nWarren on conversations with the White Sox, which want public money for a new stadium at the 78 and could complicate the Bears' ISFA request:\n\n\"We've stayed in close communication with the White Sox. We had a meeting on Sunday, just a couple days ago. I've made it clear publicly, privately and I'll make it clear now: I think it would be an absolutely incredible day in Chicago if we were able to build two stadiums at the same time. The economic benefit, the increase in tax base, the number of jobs, and also the staging of workers on two jobs. . . .If we have an opportunity to build two world-class stadiums, we'd be all for it.\n\nWarren said the Bears' request \"doesn't include any money for what (the White Sox) want, but it doesn't mean that money does not exist for what they want.\"\n\nWarren on being \"renters\" at a stadium instead of owning one, as the team had aimed to do in Arlington Heights:\n\n\"I feel strongly about the power, the substance of a public-private partnership. I believe in Mayor Johnson, I believe in his staff, I believe in his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship where one plus one equals 100 instead of three.\"\n\nWarren on what rights the team would be looking for at the new stadium, given the team's history of tension with the Chicago Park District over revenue opportunities at Soldier Field:\n\n\"The terms we'd be looking for are terms you'd do with a partner. We just want to be fair with each other. I'm confident that Mayor Johnson and leadership at the city of Chicago -- that they're fair people, they're talented business people, and we'd be able to work out fair terms. That's the only way a public-private partnership truly is able to thrive.\"\n\nWarren was asked whether the team considered the former Michael Reese hospital site south of McCormick Place as a potential stadium home. A development team led by Chicago-based Farpoint Development have expressed interest in working with the team, potentially with a stadium built over Metra tracks running along the property.\n\nWarren: \"When we started going down this (downtown stadium) road when we had trouble getting the tax situation squared in Arlington Heights, our team looked at 10 to 12 sites here in Chicago,\" including the Michael Reese site, he said. \"The difficulty is it is very narrow from a stadium footprint standpoint. It doesn't work,\" he said, adding that the NFL likely would not allow a stadium to be built over an active train line.", "source": {"uri": "chicagobusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's

Divided between constructions costs for the stadium proper and infrastructure improvements for the surrounding area, roughly half the project would be funded by the public.\n\nTeam Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Stadium Affairs Karen Murphy laid out the proposed funding plan in more detail.\n\nThe stadium itself will cost about $3.2 billion to build, she said, with the Bears' private owners contributing a little over $2 billion and the team requesting a further $300 million from the NFL. The remaining $900 million would be funded by the state via the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. Murphy claimed that $900 million could be generated via a 2% hotel tax, and by refinancing the debt taxpayers still owe for prior renovations to Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, where the Chicago White Sox play.\n\n\"In doing that, and extending the debt bonds out for 40 years, we will free up enough capacity that we believe could be close to or exceed $1 billion dollars,\" Murphy said.\n\nAs of 2024, there is still more than $620 million in outstanding debt for the Soldier Field renovations and about $50 million for the Guaranteed Rate Field renovations.\n\nThe public would also foot the bill for the proposed $1.5 billion in infrastructure improvements, which Murphy said would occur in three phases over at least five years. She attempted to soften the sticker shock for such a large investment by claiming the project would create thousands of jobs, attract events like the Super Bowl -- which Chicago has never hosted -- and drive billions in economic impact for the city, county and state.\n\n\"The private and public investments in this project are large, but the return on the investment is also significant,\" Murphy said.\n\nBears President and CEO Kevin Warren echoed her comments, telling reporters, \"We'll make this a place where people want to come and spend time.\"\n\nReception to the pitch -- among press, community groups and state leaders -- was chilly.\n\nChicago, Cook County and Illinois are already facing numerous funding pressures at the moment, including for public education, caring for a growing population of new immigrants and for the ongoing effort to replace more than 400,000 lead water pipes running beneath the city.\n\nThe Bears are also not a publicly-owned franchise -- their principal owner is the billionaire McCaskey family. At a separate event Wednesday, Democratic Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker questioned why, amid so many other pressing budget needs, the public should pay billions to fund their private ambitions.\n\nHe referenced a failed ballot referendum from earlier this month in Kansas City, where voters rejected raising public funds to build a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals.\n\n\"I think this is a recognition that these are private businesses,\" Pritzker told reporters. \"That the owners of these private businesses need to put a lot more forward in order to have their dreams fulfilled and not just rely upon the taxpayers of Illinois to make that happen for them.\"\n\nIllinois House Speaker Chris Welch also expressed skepticism, telling the Chicago Sun-Times on Wednesday that were the stadium proposal to come before the state Legislature now, it would fail \"miserably.\"\n\nThe pitch revealed Wednesday also comes after the Bears spent years -- and almost $200 million -- flirting with idea of abandoning Chicago for a stadium in the nearby suburb of Arlington Heights.\n\nIn February 2023, the team purchased 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights for about $197 million, which Warren said makes it the suburb's largest landowner. The team began clearing the site last October to prepare for construction of a new stadium, but backed away after local school districts claimed the land was worth $160 million and that the Bears would have to pay corresponding property taxes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Warren said the team still owned the Arlington Heights land but that its \"focus\" was no longer on the suburb.\n\n\"We said it before and after today we're clear that our focus is on the city of Chicago and this museum campus area,\" he said.\n\nSome predicted on Wednesday that the city, if it moved forward on the proposal, would face lawsuits from public space advocacy groups like Friends of the Parks and Protect Our Parks. The latter group filed several federal lawsuits to block construction of the Obama Presidential Center, which will effectively privatize 20 acres of public parkland on Chicago's south side, while the former sued to try and stop the 2002 renovations to Soldier Field.\n\nThough both sets of lawsuits failed, they show that some Chicagoans do not take private intrusion on public land sitting down.\n\n\"My vision for the city of Chicago is very clear, particularly around environmental justice, in creating more open space,\" Johnson said Wednesday in response to a reporter raising those concerns.\n\nThe Friends of The Park put out a statement condemning the proposal after Wednesday's press conference concluded.\n\n\"As is often the case in Chicago, the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront,\" the group said.\n\nDespite these controversies, Warren said he hoped to put the proposal in front of Illinois lawmakers as a bill before the end of the state legislative session in May.\n\n\"We feel that the time is now. Every year that we wait it's $150 to $200 million of increased costs that ultimately we'll have to figure out,\" Warren said.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_byrnes@courthousenews.com", "name": "Dave Byrnes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

We're not convinced.", "body": "Editorials | Editorial: The Bears may stir Chicago's blood with splashy pitch for a lakefront stadium. We're not convinced.\n\nChicago Bears CEO Kevin Warren, along with Mayor Brandon Johnson, invoked the illustrious name of the legendary architect Daniel Burnham more than a dozen times Wednesday in their slick public presentation on the team's domed-stadium plan for Chicago's lakefront.\n\nThat makes sense from a public relations perspective. It was Burnham's Plan of Chicago that established the idea of a city lakefront that would be \"forever open, clear and free.\" In order to get public buy-in for what would be the most substantial development on that near-sacrosanct public land, Chicagoans will need convincing this massive change lines up with Burnham's vision, long the envy of cities across the world. \"The Lakefront by right belongs to the people,\" Burnham wrote in the 1909 document. \"Not a foot of its shores should be appropriated to the exclusion of the people.\"\n\nHe did not specify any exception for NFL teams.\n\nThe Burnham plan also will likely come up in a courtroom when the near-inevitable lawsuit from Friends of the Parks and other protectors of the lakefront are filed. Assuming the Bears' costly current ambitions get to that point.\n\nWe'll get to the particulars of the plan below, but we were amazed Warren and Johnson chose to host so audacious a public display without having first briefed Gov. J.B. Pritzker on its details. After all, none of this will happen without the backing of the General Assembly and the governor. They hold the purse strings.\n\nPritzker and Senate President Don Harmon have said repeatedly -- and reiterated Wednesday -- that they see little to no public appetite for taxpayer subsidies to professional sports teams, which after all are privately owned companies. The Bears, in particular, are members of one of the most exclusive and lucrative clubs in the world -- NFL franchises. Leaguewide revenues have been climbing roughly $1 billion a year, staggering even for the broader world of professional sports. Owners are rich folks.\n\nSecondly, it was unsettling to see Johnson, who as mayor is supposed to represent taxpayers, appear to be fully on board with a plan not yet fully fleshed out. There are no agreements, we were told, on how the team and the Chicago Park District would split revenues from concerts and other events in what would most likely be a taxpayer-owned stadium. There's no deal on the rent the team would pay. Johnson and Warren evinced a mutual vibe sending the message to taxpayers that they would work it out in the future. As pals do.\n\nBeware a mayor badly in need of a PR win.\n\nJohnson, badly struggling in the first year of his term by any reasonable definition, looks to us like he's picked this majestic facility on the lakefront, not to mention the intensity of Bears fandom, to pull his mayoralty out of the ditch.\n\nMr. Mayor, you're supposed to be taxpayers' first line of protection not to mention the principal guardian of this city's most precious physical resource -- its lakefront. That's not what you looked like up on that stage.\n\nAs to the proposal itself, among the aspects that are undeniably positive is the desirability of a domed NFL stadium in the city of Chicago capable of hosting major events like Super Bowls, NCAA finals, Taylor Swift concerts, World Cup soccer games and the like. Warren, who talked to the Tribune Editorial Board Wednesday afternoon along with his savvy executive vice president of stadium development and chief operating officer, Karen Murphy, is correct when he pointed out that rival cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas are reaping the financial benefits of such happenings while Chicago isn't even in the conversation when it comes to hosting events on that level. And the renderings look most exciting.\n\nWe agree, too, with the mayor that the Chicago Bears belong in Chicago. No question. We were glad to hear Warren tell us that he now was comfortable saying definitively that the Bears want to stay in Chicago, land holdings in Arlington Heights notwithstanding.\n\nBut, wow, the hurdles to getting this stadium over the finish line are steep.\n\nFirst, there's the lakefront itself. If the Lucas Museum, which this page has argued would have been a better fit with the Museum Campus aesthetic than a domed stadium, was found to have violated the spirit of Burnham, so surely does a glitzy indoor sports arena.\n\nSecondly, the Bears are claiming that Chicago can build the stadium without hiking taxes. Technically, that's true, but only short term. The Bears want the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority to float well over $1 billion in bonds to provide $900 million for stadium construction, $150 million for a cash reserve, and hundreds of millions more to refinance existing ISFA debt funding Guaranteed Rate Field and the renovation of Soldier Field. Remarkably, those bonds would have 40-year terms, longer than any current state or city bonds.\n\nIncurring more debt means more taxpayer liability. Even if taxes don't rise immediately, that doesn't mean they won't rise eventually.\n\nThird, the genuinely exciting renderings depicting a modern stadium with a translucent roof, accompanied by playgrounds, practice fields and other attractive amenities nearby, were somewhat misleading. Neither the Bears nor the city have identified financing for those public amenities. Bears officials said it was up to the city and state to find revenue sources to make those visions a reality. Maybe federal grants? State programs? All \"future conversations.\"\n\nAs to the potential for building the stadium elsewhere in the city, Warren told us the Bears had reviewed with seriousness every potential option, including locations on the South and West sides and the city-owned property once home to Michael Reese Hospital. All of them didn't work, he claimed, for one reason or another. In the case of the Reese site, he said, the site is too narrow and presents logistical problems due to NFL security protocols.\n\nFair enough, but is the lakefront really the simplest option? With all the legal impediments so amply illustrated over the past two decades?\n\nWarren emphasized that time is of the essence in building this stadium. Delay only means the costs of the project rise. He's right. But if there's one site where nothing is likely to happen quickly, it's the lakefront tract that drove George Lucas out of Chicago and to Los Angeles.\n\nWhere there's a will, there's a way. If the Bears didn't have dreams of a lakefront palace in their eyes, we have little doubt a site in the city could be made to work more quickly. Could more land be accumulated around Michael Reese? There's vacant land throughout Chicago. Surely, creative minds also could put together a South Side or West Side plot that not only would work for a stadium but could reenergize a neighborhood in desperate need. But it's clear the Bears have zeroed in on the lakefront.\n\nThe Bears are vital to Chicago. The governor and legislative leaders should give Warren and company a respectful hearing and kick the tires of their proposal, as we will do in coming weeks.\n\nWe'll concede one major point to Warren and the Bears: These are no small plans and from our survey of the reaction on social media, they have the capacity to \"stir men's blood\" (and women's too).\n\nBut if and when Warren hears something approximating \"no,\" which could well be the reaction from the big dogs in Springfield, let's hope he, his team and our political leaders get their creative juices flowing on keeping the Chicago Bears in Chicago. Even if not on Burnham's beloved lakefront.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_board@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Burnham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Bears would cover half -- $2.3 billion -- with the help of the NFL. Public financing would handle the rest, said anonymous sources who spoke to the Trib.\n\nThe team would have to refinance its debt connected to other stadium projects for the Bears and White Sox, and taxpayers would be expected to pay for the proposed infrastructure improvements along with another $1 billion to build the new stadium, according to the Trib.\n\nThe Bears still need the Illinois General Assembly to approve new bonding for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which carries the debt for the aforementioned stadium projects, according to the Trib.\n\nThe new stadium would be south of Soldier Field.\n\nCrains reported Wednesday the Bears' portion would come from marketing revenue raised from the new stadium, including corporate naming rights and two NFL loans. The team would also rely on the sale of personal seat licenses (PSLs) to fans hoping to become season-ticket holders.\n\nThe terms of the deal would need to be included in the team's leasing agreement with the Chicago Park District, according to Crain's.\n\nThe values of PSLs that helped raise over $50 million toward the $690 million Soldier Field renovation would disappear upon the team's move to the new stadium, and PSL rates at a new Bears stadium would be some of the most expensive seats in the house, with estimated costs upwards of a $100,000 apiece, Crain's reported.\n\nThe pivot back to the lakefront marks a significant change for the Bears, who have threatened for years to leave the city for suburban Arlington Heights.\n\nThe team finalized the purchase last year of Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs for $197 million. Team officials said they'd develop the 326-acre site into a $5 billion entertainment district anchored by a domed stadium.\n\nAt the time, then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot had pitched the team on a glass-domed renovation of Soldier Field, largely considered a Hail Mary proposal.\n\nSolider Field -- save for its historical colonnades and war memorial -- would likely be torn down under the team's current proposal, the Sun-Times previously reported.", "source": {"uri": "blockclubchicago.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Block Club Chicago"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_nesbitt_golden@blockclubchicago.org", "name": "Jamie Nesbitt Golden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "mack_liederman@blockclubchicago.org", "name": "Mack Liederman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_seat_license", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal seat license"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naming rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Lightfoot", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lori Lightfoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Park_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Park District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/04/042424-Soldier-Field-New-Stadium-Colin-Boyle-0888.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Beyond the handwavy-but-not-laughable vaportecture renderings, what do we actually know about, for example, how much all this would really cost, and who would pay for it and how?\n\nChicago Bears to seek public funding in $5bn plan for new lakefront stadium\n\nBears' $3.2B lakefront stadium plans revealed\n\nChicago Bears Push Plans Forward for $4.6B Lakefront Stadium\n\nBears to reveal how to pay for $4.7 billion domed lakefront stadium development -- and what it will look like\n\nBears Ask Taxpayers for $2.4B Subsidy to Build $4.75B Domed Stadium Along Lakefront\n\nThat's not a great start, when no two headlines can even agree on what the damn thing will cost. Let's take a deeper dive and see what actual numbers Bears management provided. Yes, you in the front, Chicago Tribune?\n\nThe team proposed spending $2 billion for the stadium, plus $300 million from the NFL and $900 million to be borrowed by the state and paid back with the city's existing 2% hotel tax...\n\nBut the mayor did not specify how the city would pay for $325 million in initial infrastructure costs to open the stadium, or $1.5 billion for an optional full build-out including a hotel.\n\nSo that's $3.2 billion for the stadium proper, plus $325 million in infrastructure and $1.175 billion in \"optional\" add-ons, for a total of $4.7 billion, of which between $1.225 million and $2.4 billion would come from city funds. Any more details available about that optional full build-out, NBC Sports Chicago?\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money: one to maximize infrastructure for the stadium and surrounding campus totaling $510 million, and another phase for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million.\n\nThat's a little better, but still not exactly crystal clear. What does \"maximize infrastructure\" mean that isn't the initial $325 million in infrastructure? And what kind of additional \"optional\" round of infrastructure would maximize public economic benefits so much as to be worth $665 million in taxpayer expense? (The Real Deal reports that that last phase would include \"enhancements like new parking and multi-use playfields,\" which given that the stadium would be built atop the old parking garage doesn't seem very optional at all.)\n\nUniversity of Chicago economist Allen Sanderson, it's so good to see you, what can you tell us?\n\n\"If you take one of these estimates of how many jobs will this create, how much economic impact will it produce for an economy, take whatever number the supporters are giving you, move the decimal point one to the left, and you're pretty close. Which means 90% of it is nonsense.\"\n\nGenerally a good rule, but still doesn't shed much light on the actual costs. Maybe somebody has some charts?\n\nNoooo, those aren't any of the same numbers we saw before! And they don't include any of the infrastructure! And that little \"Financial forecasts subject to change\" disclaimer at the bottom isn't reassuring at all.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, meanwhile, vowed that there would be \"no new taxes\" for the Bears stadium project, based on the fact that the first $900 million would come from an existing 2% city hotel tax surcharge that currently goes to the state stadium authority. But that still leaves the other $325 million to $1.5 billion in infrastructure costs, plus spending the hotel tax money on this would mean it couldn't be used for other stadium authority projects meaning taxes might then have to be raised for those, so surely nobody is taking Johnson's claims at face value --\n\nAll of this might make one wonder if Bears execs' intent was to craft the most confusing set of numbers possible -- and actually, there's a decent chance that's precisely their goal. As we've seen before, one of the most powerful weapons in the stadium subsidy demand toolkit is anchoring: trying to make your proposal look good not on its own merits, but in comparison to something else. So if a team owner can create a fog of cost projections -- somewhere between $3.2 billion and $4.7 billion, with the team putting up something between 42% and 70% of the total -- then it's easier to argue that this maybe isn't so bad, especially when the sports team owner across town is only talking about putting in 10-20%.\n\nBut all that is just manipulating the denominator: As J.C. Bradbury points out, it doesn't matter how much taxpayers aren't being asked to spend toward a Bears stadium, it only matters how much they would be on the hook for. Even at $1.225 billion, this would be one of the largest public subsidies for a private sports stadium in history; if that \"optional\" infrastructure turns out not to be so optional at all and the true taxpayer price tag is more like $2.4 billion, it would shatter all records. (And all this, mind you, doesn't account for any additional hidden costs like property tax breaks, which seem likely given that the stadium would be state-owned even though the Bears would be the ones controlling its use and all its revenues.)\n\nThere are still many, many hoops this plan has to jump through, including approval from the state legislature of $1.5 billion in state bonds toward the project (of which part would be repaid by the team and part by the hotel tax, I think, this is all really hard to follow). House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch immediately declared that \"if we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" so that seems like a stumbling block. The parks preservation group Friends of the Parks, which has previously sued to block other development along the lakefront, also fired a warning shot about the Bears proposal, declaring that \"as is so often the case in Chicago, the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront\" and \"we have too many questions to make any decision about the value of these plans.\"\n\nThis is all very exhausting. At the very least, can we have some fresh lens flare for our troubles?\n\nAhhhh, that's the stuff. Who can put a price -- let alone half a dozen different prices -- on that?", "source": {"uri": "fieldofschemes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Field of Schemes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Deal_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Real Deal (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Johnson_(athlete)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Johnson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lens flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opportunity cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.fieldofschemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-at-8.52.43-AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The team's lease there runs through 2033.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. in suburban Arlington Heights. The team envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre (131 hectare) tract of land some 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson has made it clear he wants to keep the team in the city.\n\n\"I have said all along that meaningful private investment and a strong emphasis on public benefit are my requirements for public-private partnerships in our city,\" Johnson said last month.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

J.B. Pritzker and the Democratic leaders in the state House and Senate made clear the team doesn't currently have the support it needs to make the architectural renderings a reality.\n\nWith the price tag of the stadium itself estimated at $3.2 billion, the Bears are asking the state to take on $900 million in new debt to cover the remaining cost, backed by an existing 2% tax on hotel stays in the city, as well as an additional $1.5 billion in unspecified \"infrastructure\" funding to reimagine Soldier Field for park space and youth athletic programming.\n\nThe team also wants the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority to refinance existing debt for prior projects at Soldier Field and at Guaranteed Rate Field, where the White Sox play, and to borrow at least $150 million to cover future shortfalls in hotel tax revenue. The new so-called liquidity fund would insulate the city from having its share of state funds reduced when the dedicated tax doesn't bring in enough to cover the annual payment.\n\nThe plan calls for repayment of the new borrowing to be stretched out over 40 years, and the whole proposal would require approval from the legislature and the governor. Neither Bears officials nor Chicago Chief Financial Officer Jill Jaworski could say what the total tab would be of that debt for future taxpayers over the planned 40-year term, but both argued the costs would largely be borne by out-of-towners staying in city hotels.\n\n\"I believe strongly that this is not a high priority for legislators and certainly not for me,\" Pritzker said during an unrelated event in Maywood, held at the same time the Bears and Johnson were making their pitch.\n\nEven as the Bears are seeking quick state approval, the governor has yet to even meet with the team about its plans, a sign of the uphill battle team officials face in trying to push the proposal through the General Assembly before lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn May 24.\n\nHouse Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch of Hillside, speaking at the same Maywood event where he joined Pritzker to tout the governor's health insurance reform proposal, put it more bluntly.\n\n\"I'm going to say to you publicly what I said to (Bears President) Kevin Warren privately last week: If we were to put this issue on the floor for a vote right now, it would fail,\" Welch told reporters.\n\nLike Pritzker and Welch, Senate President Don Harmon of Oak Park welcomed the Bears' commitment to providing private money for the project, which includes a $300 million loan from the NFL.\n\n\"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism,\" Harmon said in a statement.\n\nAt Soldier Field, where renderings of the proposed new Bears stadium were displayed with great fanfare and even a hype video, Warren countered the initial pushback from state officials, whose absence from the unveiling was noteworthy.\n\n\"Today was the first day that we have been able to publicly roll out our plan, so it's very difficult for someone to say they're against this and we just presented it,\" Warren said. \"So we look forward to having more conversations with the individuals in Springfield, Gov. Pritzker and Speaker Welch, and I haven't seen any of these things that you're alluding to because I've been here on stage. But we'll continue proceeding forward.\"\n\nSpeaking later to the Tribune Editorial Board, Warren said conversations with state officials have been taking place, though \"they have not reached the level of with the city.\"\n\n\"I'd like to look forward to a productive conversation with the governor and his staff members to be able to articulate our plan to him and hopefully share why this makes sense not only to the city of Chicago but to the state of Illinois,\" Warren said.\n\nBut the team is depending, at least in part, on help from Johnson and his administration in selling the plan in Springfield, which could be a gamble given the at-times tense relationship between City Hall and the governor's office.\n\nIn addition to asking for state help to finance a portion of the stadium construction, the team also is looking for as much as $1.5 billion in public funding for infrastructure improvements spread out over three phases lasting up to five years.\n\nThe city would be responsible for finding those dollars, but neither city nor Bears officials gave specifics about what state or federal funding buckets they hoped to tap.\n\nThe first phase -- largely to move utilities and roads to accommodate the new location and reduce bottlenecks for fans driving to and from the stadium -- would cost $325 million. It is \"required\" to open the stadium, Bears officials said.\n\nThe next two phases would include the open spaces the mayor lauded as the public benefit to the city at large. The second phase would include the demolition of much of Soldier Field, with the exception of the historic colonnades that surround the current stadium and the south end horseshoe around the current Gate O containing the exterior Soldier Field dedication \"to the men and women of the Armed Forces.\" Also included in the second phase would be parking, a bus depot expansion, and new parks and playing fields, according to the team's presentation. That part would cost $510 million.\n\nThe third phase, which could cost $665 million, would include other enhancements to the Museum Campus, including restoring the colonnades, making \"further transportation improvements,\" adding retail and other public attractions.\n\nThe mayor's full embrace of the Bears' plan is a 180-degree turn from the team's frayed relations with Johnson's predecessor, Lori Lightfoot. Her first reaction to the team's interest in moving to Arlington Heights was to mock the NFL franchise and encourage its leaders to \"focus on putting a winning team on the field, beating the Packers finally and being relevant past October.\"\n\nIf Johnson becomes the mayor who keeps the Bears in Chicago, that could be seen as a major and much-needed victory for a newcomer who has had a rocky first year in office. But there's no guarantee voters will embrace public financing to assist a multi-million dollar private business such as the Bears. And it also won't be easy given Johnson has expended significant political capital in Springfield on the ongoing migrant issue while other pressing needs such as increased state spending on education remain pending.\n\nTo that end, the progressive mayor maintained the project does not contradict his values of investing in the South and West sides, arguing the economic benefit will reverberate across the region.\n\n\"This is going to reinvigorate the entire city of Chicago,\" Johnson said. \"It will be the crown jewel of the city of Chicago.\"\n\nWhether that argument will whip up enough votes in Springfield, however, remains to be seen.\n\nTo advance their plan, the Bears and Johnson will have to win over not only Pritzker and the legislative leaders but also rank-and-file lawmakers.\n\nState Sen. Robert Peters, whose district includes Soldier Field, said he remained skeptical and hadn't had the opportunity to fully examine the proposal yet, though he gave the Bears credit for coming to the table with a substantial private investment.\n\nNevertheless, he said he harbors doubts about whether all the promises would pay off.\n\n\"Sports teams have (economic) contributions, but oftentimes we talk about stadium deals, they tend to sell those contributions a lot bigger than they actually end up being,\" Peters said. \"I don't know of any sports stadium deal that's ever actually met the lofty goals of their project.\"\n\nVeteran Rep. La Shawn Ford, a Chicago Democrat, said the state legislature needs to \"stay open and strike a balance.\"\n\n\"In the present form, it would probably die,\" he said. \"But things change if people come to their senses, and say, 'Look, we need to offer the state and the city more.'\"\n\nEven state Rep. Kam Buckner, who attended the Bears' announcement, said his presence was not a function of his support for the plan, some details of which he said he learned for the first time Wednesday.\n\nFor the negotiations with the Bears to be real, the team needs to commit to staying in Chicago, said Buckner, whose district also includes Soldier Field.\n\n\"Today was the first step in that direction, which was helpful,\" he said.\n\nDespite the team's promised private investment, \"the appetite in Springfield is extremely low\" for any public financing, Buckner said.\n\nAnother factor complicating the team's Springfield sales pitch is its prior commitment to building a stadium in Arlington Heights, where it spent $197 million to purchase the former Arlington International Racecourse.\n\nConvincing suburban lawmakers to support a new Chicago stadium for the Bears could be a tough sell, particularly for those who would be left with a large undeveloped tract of land in their community.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Mary Beth Canty of Arlington Heights said the economic benefits the Bears promised in their latest stadium plans in Chicago would also be possible at the former racetrack. And, like Pritzker, the Bears' ask for public funding would come at the expense of other state needs, she said.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of very big and important things that we are trying to accomplish for families here in Illinois, and I think that's where people's attention will be focused for the remainder of the session,\" she said. \"I think those days of sort of rushing through things at the end of the session are long gone, especially when you're talking about dollar amounts at the levels that they're speaking of.\"\n\nFor his part, Warren acknowledged the team still has work to do at the statehouse.\n\n\"We don't think this is a fait accompli,\" Warren told the Tribune Editorial Board.\n\n\"There are different constituents at different places and time along the path to finalizing this deal. So you may have the mayor at one location; the governor may be somewhere else. The speaker, the president of the Senate, different elected officials. That's just what normally happens. But we hope that when it's time to take a vote, that they all are in the same location and that is to say, 'Yes, let's go forward and make this happen.'\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_petrella@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Dan Petrella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "olivia_olander@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Olivia Olander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "a_d_quig@chicagotribune.com", "name": "A.D.

A large glass window allows views of the skyline.\n\n\"You'll get all of the benefits of being indoors,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren at the announcement. \"But you'll be outdoors.\"\n\nThe stadium is planned for the Waldron parking deck just south of Soldier Field.\n\nHowever, check out the stadium renderings accompanying this story. Look at how big that thing is. The size almost makes the Museum Campus buildings look like neo-classical LEGO blocks in comparison.\n\nAt some angles, it looks as if it gives Lakeside Center -- a building with a 19-acre roof -- a run for its money.\n\nWhile the Bears did not disclose the stadium's dimensions, Manica-designed Allegiant is 226 feet tall. That's almost 80 feet taller than the current Soldier Field.\n\nJudging from the renderings, the stadium looks pretty good as far as professional sports facilities go. It's the right building but the wrong spot.\n\nFrankly, it would've fit well in Arlington Heights, had the team not up and abandoned its bid to build there.\n\nAnd imagine what it might've done for the old South Works site at 79th Street and right there on the lake. The team would have had to solve the parcel's environmental issues, but given the team is going to ask for a billion in stadium subsidies anyway (more on that later) why not go there?\n\nBut a big pro football stadium with all the fixings in the heart of the lakefront? The city should have passed. Or run.\n\nAnd proof of that can be seen in the Bears plan for Soldier Field. The team proposed yanking out the stadium's seating bowl and almost all its innards and turning the spot into a recreational area within the preserved historic colonnades.\n\n\"We'll make this a place where people will want to come and spend time,\" Warren said.\n\nThe irony? With the old playing field turned into baseball fields and parkland, the retooled Soldier Field would be far more harmonious with the lakefront and the Museum Campus than the out-of-scale football stadium that would make it possible.\n\nWhen it comes to the new stadium, the Bears -- not city government -- are running the offense here, and that's troubling.\n\nTeam officials acted like city-paid planners and transit experts as they outlined the additional roadways and infrastructure needs that would have to happen to get the project off the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Team Johnson stood by as a private entity took the lead and told how the public's lakefront would be redeveloped.\n\nAs madding as that is, can you really blame the Bears? In the parlance of their game, they saw an opening -- or perhaps a weakness in City Hall -- and took it.\n\nAdmittedly, the Waldron parking deck is a concrete eyesore and does a disservice to the lakefront. The Museum Campus needs a revamp and Soldier Field is showing its age.\n\nBut the public and elected officials, not the Bears, should be the ones deciding what remedies are needed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bears said they will pay $2 billion to design and construct the publicly-owned stadium -- with the help of the NFL and the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority.\n\nThere is a catch though: The team also said it would require an additional $1.5 billion in public infrastructure and transit to make all those pretty renderings fully come to life.\n\nHow can a mayor -- an allegedly progressive one, at that -- allow a billion-dollar football franchise to build what it likes on the lakefront, then charge taxpayers for the privilege? It's outright ridiculous.\n\nBut, somehow, not to Johnson.\n\n\"Simply put, this is going to reinvigorate the entire city of Chicago,\" Johnson said. \"It will be the crown jewel of the city of Chicago.\"\n\nWrong, Mr. Mayor. Chicago's crown jewel is its lakefront. And you're helping to tarnish it.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But during Wednesday's press conference announcing the Bears' plans for a new stadium on Chicago's lakefront, they failed to mention any inclusion of the White Sox in their financial plan.\n\n\"No, it [the plan] doesn't include any money for what they [White Sox] want,\" Bears CEO/President Kevin Warren said on Wednesday. \"But it doesn't mean that money does not exist for what they want. So that's why we're continuing conversations.\"\n\nIn early April, the city of Chicago rejected part of a financial proposal from the Bears and White Sox for their respective stadium.\n\nAccording to Crain's Chicago Business, the city rejected usage of the city's amusement tax from ticket sales at their respective stadiums to help the debt of the ISFA (Illinois Sports Facilities Authority) bonds attached to both Guaranteed Rate Field and the 2003 Soldier Field renovations.\n\nUsually, the leftover debt from the ISFA bonds --- which isn't covered by Illinois' 2% hotel tax --- is doled out to municipalities in tax money. The idea was to construct a separate line of revenue from the city's 9% amusement tax to help cover the shortcomings of the hotel tax. But it's since been rejected.\n\nSeparately, the Bears and White Sox each have their financial plans laid out for their respective stadiums.\n\nThe Bears hope to construct a domed stadium on Chicago's lakefront with some public dollars. They project their full stadium project will cost $4.7 billion. The team said it would contribute just over $2 billion, ask for $300 million from the NFL, and look to the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority for $900 million. That leaves a gap of about $1.5 billion, and the team would look for public money to make up the difference.\n\nAs for the White Sox (according to multiple reports), they are aiming to build a new stadium at \"The 78,\" which is a plot of open land in the South Loop of Chicago's downtown area. They're hoping for public funding to assist their $1.25 billion stadium, too, using a collection of hotel taxes, sales taxes from the hypothetical stadium and private investments to help issue new bonds and create new lines of revenue for said bonds and the stadium.\n\nRecently, Crain's reported Reinsdorf has mentioned a figure of $200 million of his investment to the pool of stadium money, too.\n\nStill, that doesn't satiate the lawmakers' request to combine a public financing plan between both teams. Warren is an advocate of constructing both stadiums, even though the Bears and White Sox don't have a joint plan.\n\n\"I've made it very clear publicly, privately, and I'll make it clear now: I think it would be an absolutely incredible day in Chicago if we were able to build two stadiums at the same time,\" Warren said. \"One, the economic benefit, the increased tax base, the number of jobs, and also the staging of workers so we can have people working on two different jobs.\n\n\"And as I said in my opening remarks, we've got to decide who we want to be as a city. But we have an opportunity to build two world-class stadiums. We'd be all for it. We stayed in close communication with them. I don't know the specifics of their plan. But I look forward to the day that we can continually stay in close communication and I would be absolutely ecstatic if both of us were able to build our stadiums here at the same time.\"\n\nHow do lawmakers respond?\n\nShortly after the Bears' stadium presentation, Illinois Senate President Don Harmon responded with his thoughts.\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer,\" Harmon said in a statement. \"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"\n\nAs Harmon alluded to, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he remained \"skeptical\" about the Bears' proposal to build a new publicly-owned stadium in Chicago, before the presentation began.\n\n\"I wonder if it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said. \"It's very important to me that, with all the state needs to accomplish, that we think about what the priorities are for the state... there are a lot of priorities the state has and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIt might come down to a battle between the Bears and White Sox for their respective public funding needs. In that case, Economist/Davidson College professor Fred Smith told NBC Sports Chicago back in March the Bears would be the likely favorable choice.\n\n\"I think it will make sense for them to work together because there is the danger that they 'won't get picked' if they try to go in alone. Admittedly, that risk is lower for the Bears, but it is still there,\" Smith said in a text conversation with NBC Sports Chicago.\n\nWhy would the Bears get the better look?\n\nThe name of the game in stadium economics is outside dollars, Smith said. The ability to draw dollars from outside the city and state is how the local economy would benefit from a stadium project. In the Bears' case, that's more feasible, given they plan to have a large capacity stadium with year-round access via their translucent dome, able to host several outside events not including Bears games.\n\nFor the White Sox, that's a hill they might not be able to climb.\n\n\"If you look at the proposal from the White Sox, it looks like a gorgeous ballpark and there's retail and commercial development around it, maybe some hotels,\" Smith told NBC Sports Chicago. \"That's definitely going to increase the economic vibrancy around that neighborhood.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, all that's doing is changing where people are spending their dollars. If people are spending their dollars in that neighborhood, then maybe they're not spending their dollars in Logan Square, or maybe they're not spending their dollars in Wrigleyville.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crain's_Chicago_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crain's Chicago Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Harmon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don Harmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Already, traffic problems exist with entering and exiting the lakefront campus; whether on foot or behind a wheel.\n\nWhat are the Bears' plans to address the increased traffic?\n\nBears newly appointed Chief Operating Officer Karen Murphy laid out the plan for traffic to the proposed stadium.\n\nThe first phase of the plan includes creating an \"improved interchange\" at 18th Street, which would become 19th Street on Lakeshore Drive. They're also looking at an entrance to the campus from the South to tie into their South parking lot.\n\nDouble-decking the South parking lot is also in the realm of possibilities.\n\nOn the North side, the Bears are looking to remove the light on Lakeshore Drive and McFetridge. They also hope to increase the space and accessibility on the lakefront path for pedestrians who are walking to the stadium.\n\nThe Bears estimate a 20% increase in campus capacity on the South side, with a 10-minute reduction in campus exit time. On the North side, they estimate a 50% increase in campus access --- likely because of the destruction of Soldier Field.\n\n\"If both these phases are done, this would be a 50% increase in lane capacity to the site, as well as a 20-minute reduction in exit times from our parking ramps, and 1,200 less hours daily for commuters on DuSable Lakeshore Drive,\" Murphy said during the presentation.\n\nMORE: How Bears plan to fund Chicago stadium project, and how much it will cost taxpayers\n\nAs far as financing this part of the stadium, it's not entirely clear, yet.\n\nThe team expects the entire stadium project to cost $4.7 billion: $3.2 for the stadium itself and just over $300 million for the infrastructure required to open it, then $1.2 billion for two other phases of development.\n\nThere wasn't a clear answer as to where the team would get the $300 million for the infrastructure. Murphy said the team is still working with the state and looking into different funding sources.\n\nIf the team gets the public funding needed to open the stadium, they said there will be two more phases of development requiring public money: one to maximize infrastructure for the stadium and surrounding campus totaling $510 million, and another phase for \"optional infrastructure to enhance the campus, improve circulation, and maximize public economic benefits,\" totaling $665 million. Add up all three phases plus the IFSA funding, and it's nearly $2.4 billion in public money.\n\nChicago mayor Brandon Johnson said on Wednesday that the Bears' new plan to build a stadium in Chicago will not raise taxes on city residents.\n\n\"I'm going to repeat that one more time to make sure that everybody gets it,\" Johnson said after the announcement. \"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Shore_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lake Shore Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_(road)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interchange (road)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commuting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commuting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Johnson_(athlete)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Johnson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7HeUJ5jwlP4gXMg88yUL9A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/acd695144771de40b69568d9ee9293b7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

President shares new details explaining decision", "body": "Why do Bears want to build fixed-roof dome? President shares new details explaining decision originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago\n\nFor as long as the Bears have talked about new stadium plans, they've talked about their future stadium having a fixed roof. From former president Ted Phillips to current president Kevin Warren, from Arlington Heights to Chicago, building a domed stadium has been a constant. On Wednesday, Warren shared some more details on why the team will opt for a sealed dome rather than a retractable roof.\n\n\"That's another couple $100 million, and when we talked to organizations who had retractable roofs they said they used it maybe three or four times a year,\" Warren said. \"We tried to be fiscally responsible by building the stadium.\"\n\nWarren led the charge for the Vikings' U.S. Bank stadium project, which also has a fixed roof and pointed to that stadium, along with the Raiders' Allegiant Stadium and the Rams' SoFi Stadium as examples. Those stadiums are known for big, translucent windows to allow natural light to filter into the stadium. Warren said the proposed Bears stadium in Chicago would have the same, and offer views of the surrounding city.\n\n\"You'll feel like you're outdoors, that you may have to wear sunglasses,\" Warren said.\n\nThe renderings the Bears released are impressive looking, but Illinois lawmakers splashed water on the idea that they will come to pass for certain. Before the presentation began, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he was skeptical of the proposal to build a new publicly-owned stadium in the city.\n\n\"I wonder if it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said. \"It's very important to me that, with all the state needs to accomplish, that we think about what the priorities are for the state... there are a lot of priorities the state has and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nAfter the presentation, Illinois Senate President Dan Harmon added his voice to the conversation.\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer,\" Harmon said in a statement. \"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"\n\nPer the Bears presentation, they project their full stadium project will cost $4.7 billion. The team said it would contribute just over $2 billion, ask for $300 million from the NFL, and look to the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority for $900 million. That leaves a gap of about $1.5 billion, and the team would look for public money to make up the difference. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was emphatic in saying there would be no new taxes for Chicago residents. That seemingly leaves the team to look for state or federal dollars.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there.

Here's what you need to know:\n\nHow we got here\n\nIn 1971, the Bears moved from Wrigley Field to Soldier Field to meet the NFL's requirements for seating capacity. Now, Soldier Field has the smallest capacity in the league (61,500).\n\nThe Bears have watched as team after team has built immaculate stadiums, and those franchises don't have to share revenue as a tenant in their building. As much as the McCaskeys treasure the tradition of Soldier Field, the NFL is a business, and the Bears are lagging behind the rest of the league when it comes to their stadium and making money off it. This has been inevitable. -- Fishbain\n\nMore work left to do\n\nAs the Bears said in their open letter, it's \"an important next step.\" But there is still a lot of work to do. The Bears' letter stressed that point while pitching the project as an opportunity for the region to host \"world-class entertainment and sporting events on an unprecedented scale.\" The job, though, now belongs to new team president and chief executive officer Kevin Warren -- and the Bears are extremely excited about that. Warren's resume includes the construction of the Vikings' U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. It's one of the best stadiums in the NFL. \"When you land it like we did in Minnesota, you can feel it -- feel it every way,\" Warren said last month. -- Jahns\n\nDoes it make sense financially?\n\nIf building an NFL stadium is like running a marathon, the Bears just bought their running shoes. Next up? The expensive and difficult parts. Heck, the Bears might not even run this race.\n\nBy closing on their nearly $200 million deal to buy the 326-acre Arlington Park racetrack property, the Bears now have to move on to trying to finance the project, which is expected to cost billions of dollars. The Bears are touting this as one of the \"largest mega-projects in Midwest history.\" But can they find the money to get it done?\n\nThe organization is, of course, asking for public funding for the project. Getting the funding sorted out is the next step.\n\n\"If we construct a state-of-the-art stadium, we will not seek taxpayer funds locally or otherwise for the structure,\" the Bears wrote in their statement. \"If we proceed, however, this project would require assistance to ensure feasibility, including our securing property tax certainty and support for infrastructure commensurate with the public benefits the project will yield to the region.\" -- Greenberg\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"Last fall, we released an open letter confirming the team had reached an agreement for the purpose of acquiring 326 acres of property in Arlington Heights to secure the potential of beginning a new and exciting chapter for the Bears, our fans, the Chicagoland community, and the State of Illinois,\" the letter said. \"This week, we took another step toward realizing that vision by closing on the Arlington Park property.\"\n\n\"There is still a tremendous amount of due diligence work to be done to determine if constructing an enclosed state-of-the-art stadium and multi-purpose entertainment district is feasible.\"\n\nRequired reading", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

Taxpayers were still on the hook for $631 million for Soldier Field debt as of last year.\n\nThe new site would be on what are now parking lots just south of Soldier Field. The colonnades from the old structure would be saved. The proposal is believed to potentially include a hotel and improved access to and from DuSable Lake Shore Drive.\n\nThe Bears bought the former Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights for $197 million last year, and announced plans for a $5 billion mixed-use development with a stadium, housing and entertainment. But the team switched focus back to Chicago this year after property tax negotiations with local school districts broke down.\n\nSeveral other communities, including Naperville and Aurora, also expressed interest in luring the Bears.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson's office declined to comment Monday, but he has recently spoken about having promising conversations with Warren and hinted at unspecified benefits that Chicago would reap from the team's continued presence downtown.\n\nDuring an unrelated news conference last Wednesday, the mayor again said \"ownership has to put some skin in the game\" when asked about the ongoing jockeying for new stadiums by the Bears as well as other Chicago sports teams such as the White Sox. He also maintained there would be no new taxes to help out the franchises.\n\n\"If we're going to build 21st century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire city of Chicago, and these conversations particularly with the Bears have been quite positive,\" Johnson said. \"I appreciate the leadership of Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nThe last part of his statement was in response to a question about a rejected proposal from the White Sox, first reported by Crain's Chicago Business, to use part of the amusement tax to fund new stadiums for the Bears and White Sox, to which Johnson on Wednesday said, \"We didn't like the idea, it was that simple.\"\n\nGov.

Then came their financial request.\n\nThe team is putting more than $2 billion on the table, plus $300 million from an NFL fund to build stadiums, but more money is needed.\n\nThe Bears want $900 million from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, 28% of the proposal.\n\n\"This is going to reinvigorate the entire city of Chicago,\" said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. \"It will be the crown jewel of the city of Chicago.\"\n\nThe bonding request is complicated. In addition to roughly $1 billion, the Bears want to refinance $629 million in debt from Soldier Field renovations 20 years ago using the city's hotel tax. New bonds would extend for 40 years.\n\nAdditionally, to make the stadium a reality, the Bears are proposing three phases of infrastructure and museum campus improvement. To get shovels in the ground, they're requesting $325 million from the state or federal government now, then $510 million in Phase 2, and $665 million in Phase 3.\n\n\"We need more cranes in the sky here, and that's why I want us to get beyond picking on what's wrong with this project and instead of saying what's right with it,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said.\n\n\"What I've said from the very beginning is that an investment like this requires real skin in the game from ownership, which they've done that,\" Johnson added. \"A commitment to public use - they've done that. As well as an overall committee to building a better, stronger, safer Chicago.\"\n\nSpringfield leaders say they're skeptical.\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker says he was not invited to Wednesday's Bears event.\n\n\"Look, I'm a Bears fan. I want to be clear: I want them to win and have a great place to play, but I just think that taxpayer dollars need to be protected,\" Pritzker said.\n\nThe governor notes that under the Bears' plan, they would take all of the hotel tax revenue for their stadium despite the White Sox and Red Stars seeking new homes, too.\n\n\"I'm going to say to you publicly what I said to Kevin Warren privately last week: If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail, and it would fail miserably. There's no environment for something like this today,\" said House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch.\n\nRailing against taxpayer subsidies is former Governor Pat Quinn, who wants to take the matter to the voters.\n\n\"Give us a chance to vote at the ballot box on whether or not this proposed stadium for the Bears, this billion-dollar-boondoggle, should be allowed to happen,\" he said.\n\nThe Bears insist their plan will create 43,000 construction jobs and have an economic impact of $8 billion.

The Price? Nearly $5B", "body": "Hosting a Super Bowl, something previously unavailable to the Bears, sits as a central piece of proposal.\n\nThe Bears, of course, are a football team, but to borrow terminology from basketball events they now hope to host, the team is now putting on a full-court press to advance their vision of a new, domed lakefront stadium.\n\nAs expected, the Bears on Wednesday unveiled a detailed vision for a new stadium just south of the existing Soldier Field, building materially from the team's initially stated intent last month to remain in the city of Chicago. Armed with an extensive deck of new renderings and a splashy hype video, team officials and Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson sought to rally support behind what would be one of the largest developments in the city's long history.\n\n\"This is not an easy project, but Chicago doesn't like it easy,\" Bears president Kevin Warren said. \"We like to do the difficult things. We like to do the things that resonate with people for generations to come. It's time for us to do something special together.\"\n\nThe proposed publicly owned stadium -- which would at last give the third-largest media market in the U.S. an opportunity to host major events such as the Super Bowl, College Football Playoff, and the Final Four -- seeks to honor the existing character of the Chicago museum campus, including a preservation of the historic Soldier Field colonnades while also building a next-generation stadium, complete with a translucent roof (above) not unlike the ones at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\n\nDespite the extensive scale of the team's ambition, there remain serious questions about how the stadium will be funded. The total price tag is slightly higher than previously projected, now coming in at $3.2 billion, with at least $325 million and as much as $1.5 billion in additional infrastructure requirements. The Bears have pledged $2 billion in direct contributions, along with another $300 million in financing through the NFL. The team is asking for $900 million in public bonding, funded through the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority and backed by an existing hotel tax, while financial support for three planned phases of infrastructure improvements around the stadium is particularly undetermined.\n\n\"There are dollars that we believe exist at the state level, maybe the federal level, and potentially the city level,\" Warren said.\n\nJohnson, however, reiterated \"this project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\" Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker was not part of the Bears' event Wednesday; he said he \"remains skeptical\" about the team's proposal, adding that \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nThe prospect of hosting a Super Bowl at the new venue was a particular part of Warren's pitch, and he cited the stadium's location within walking distance of top-tier downtown restaurants and hotels, as well as the availability of two large-scale airports.\n\n\"How many people would love to come to a Super Bowl in Chicago?\" Warren asked. \"Everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_fisher@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Eric Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Insisting it no longer plans to build a stadium in the suburbs, the team said it would demolish its current nearly 100-year-old home, Soldier Field, and replace it with gardens and athletic fields.\n\nOnly Soldier Field's colonnades would be preserved under the plan that also calls for creating a 14-acre campus with panoramic views of the lake and cityscape that would include athletic fields, parks, a promenade and a plaza where food and beverages would be sold.\n\nThe 77,000-seat stadium would not have a retractable roof -- which team President Kevin Warren said would have added $2 million to the cost and would likely be used infrequently. Instead it would be covered by a translucent roof.\n\n\"You'll be indoors, but you'll have all the benefits of being outdoors. It will feel like you are outdoors,\" he said.\n\nThe team worked with Kansas City-based architectural firm Manica to create plans for the proposed stadium that would be owned by the Chicago Park District.\n\nIt also would have a north wall made of glass to highlight the city's Michigan Avenue skyline.\n\nThe team wants to fund the stadium with $2.3 billion of private funding, including a $300 million loan from the National Football League -- and $2.3 billion in public funding that would need approval by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, a government entity created in 1987 for constructing and renovating professional sports stadiums in tIllinois.\n\n\"We are asking the [authority] to do what they were put in place to do,\" Warren said.\n\nThe team envisions the new stadium as a place where the city could host world-class events including the Super Bowl, Olympics or college level basketball finals. It would also welcome school teams to play and host events such as concerts or graduation ceremonies.\n\nKaren Murphy, executive vice president of stadium development for the Bears, said the overall project would be constructed in phases.\n\nThe first phase would include $325 million for roadway and utility improvements, which she said are crucial to a new stadium.\n\n\"We need the $325 million [for infrastructure improvements] to open the stadium,\" said Murphy, explaining that the team would seek city, state and federal funds to pay for these improvements.\n\nThe second phase of the campus would require $510 million for parking, new parks and playing fields. The third phase would be $665 million for additional transportation improvements, retail and public attractions.\n\nEvoking the legacy of Daniel Burnham who advocated in the early 20th century to keep the lakefront open to the public, Warren said the plan is in keeping with a city ordinance intended to protect that area from development.\n\n\"This will create 20% more open space for the city of Chicago,\" he said.\n\nThe Friends of the Parks released a statement opposing the new stadium.\n\n\"Once again, Chicago taxpayers are being told what is good for them,\" the statement reads. \"We are told that a new domed stadium on protected lakefront land will make Chicago a great city. We are already a great city -- in large part due to our protected lakefront. As is so often the case in Chicago, the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast-track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront.\"\n\nWarren said the team is abandoning its plan to build a stadium on 325 acres it previously purchased in northwest suburban Arlington Heights.\n\n\"We are clear that our focus is on the city of Chicago and the museum campus,\" he said, estimating that the project would have an $8 billion economic impact on the region.", "source": {"uri": "enr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Engineering News-Record (ENR)

President shares new details explaining decision", "body": "Bears president/CEO Kevin Warren said the team considered a retractable roof and explained why they decided against it\n\nFor as long as the Bears have talked about new stadium plans, they've talked about their future stadium having a fixed roof. From former president Ted Phillips to current president Kevin Warren, from Arlington Heights to Chicago, building a domed stadium has been a constant. On Wednesday, Warren shared some more details on why the team will opt for a sealed dome rather than a retractable roof.\n\n\"That's another couple $100 million, and when we talked to organizations who had retractable roofs they said they used it maybe three or four times a year,\" Warren said. \"We tried to be fiscally responsible by building the stadium.\"\n\nWarren led the charge for the Vikings' U.S. Bank stadium project, which also has a fixed roof and pointed to that stadium, along with the Raiders' Allegiant Stadium and the Rams' SoFi Stadium as examples. Those stadiums are known for big, translucent windows to allow natural light to filter into the stadium. Warren said the proposed Bears stadium in Chicago would have the same, and offer views of the surrounding city.\n\n\"You'll feel like you're outdoors, that you may have to wear sunglasses,\" Warren said.\n\nThe renderings the Bears released are impressive looking, but Illinois lawmakers splashed water on the idea that they will come to pass for certain. Before the presentation began, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he was skeptical of the proposal to build a new publicly-owned stadium in the city.\n\n\"I wonder if it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said. \"It's very important to me that, with all the state needs to accomplish, that we think about what the priorities are for the state... there are a lot of priorities the state has and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nAfter the presentation, Illinois Senate President Dan Harmon added his voice to the conversation.\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer,\" Harmon said in a statement. \"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"\n\nPer the Bears presentation, they project their full stadium project will cost $4.7 billion. The team said it would contribute just over $2 billion, ask for $300 million from the NFL, and look to the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority for $900 million. That leaves a gap of about $1.5 billion, and the team would look for public money to make up the difference. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was emphatic in saying there would be no new taxes for Chicago residents. That seemingly leaves the team to look for state or federal dollars.\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there. But contentious negotiations about property taxes in the suburbs have become an obstacle for that plan. Earlier this year the team said it was switching its focus away from Arlington Heights back to the city.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It will include the surrounding park area, and the infrastructure around the Museum Campus nearby.\n\nThe Bears are planning to contribute $2.3 billion, including a $300 million loan from the NFL, to the $3.2 billion cost of the stadium, and will seek $900 million in public funding through 40-year bonds issued by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which helped fund the 2002 renovation of Soldier Field, as well as the construction and renovations of Guaranteed Rate Field, the home of the White Sox.\n\nThe $900 million in public funding for the stadium would come from an existing 2% hotel tax that already goes to the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority.\n\nThe Bears also would ask to refinance existing debt from the prior work at Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field\n\nThat funding plan would require approval from the Illinois General Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, the surrounding infrastructure is expected to cost $1.5 billion -- for a grand total of $4.7 billion for the plan.\n\n\"The infrastructure component of this, which is the place that is most immediately, directly and likely to be the taxpayer burden; to be the government financing burden,\" said Joe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation.\n\nFerguson agreed that the infrastructure bill amounts to a hidden cost to the Chicago taxpayer.\n\nThe Bears and the City of Chicago suggested they would ask the federal government to front at least some of the remaining bill.\n\n\"There's substantial infrastructure funding that comes from the federal government gets remitted to the state, and becomes available for projects around the state,\" Chicago Chief Financial Officer Jill Jaworski said Wednesday. \"We will be working with the state to pursue those funds for the road work that's going to be needed.\"\n\nWarren said he's hoping to get approval of the financing plan from the Illinois General Assembly this spring, and to begin construction in the summer of 2025.\n\nBut experts worry about how the money might flow, depending on who sits in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Let's put a fine point on it,\" said Ferguson. \"If Donald Trump is president, the federal spigot gets turned off -- period.\"\n\nThere is also doubt over possible taxpayer funding for the infrastructure money in Springfield. Gov. JB Pritzker has said he's willing to consider the Bears' plans, but has voiced reluctance to provide public funding for the project.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal, and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said Wednesday morning at an unrelated event before the Bears' formal announcement. \"It's very important to me that, with all that the state needs to accomplish, that we think about what the priorities are of the state.\"\n\nPritzker also noted that public financing for stadium deals has become more unpopular in recent years, pointing to Missouri voters earlier this month rejecting a proposed sales tax hike to help fund renovations to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, just months after the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years.\n\n\"I think this is, you know, a recognition that these are private businesses; that the owners of these private businesses need to put a lot more forward in order to ... have their dreams fulfilled, and not just rely upon the taxpayers of Illinois to make that happen for them,\" he said. \"Having said that, I think all of us want success for the state.

Pritzker, legislative leaders 'skeptical' of using taxpayer dollars", "body": "CHICAGO (WGEM) - The Chicago Bears are asking taxpayers for about $2.4 billion to build a new stadium project next to their current stadium, Soldier Field, along Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago.\n\nThe team unveiled its proposal Wednesday at an event at Soldier Field with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.\n\nThe team and the NFL plans to contribute about $2.3 billion towards the development.\n\nThe proposal calls for the state using the existing Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA) to contribute $900 million to the $3.225 billion stadium. The project would also call for an additional $1.5 billion to improve infrastructure around the stadium using taxpayer dollars.\n\nOriginally created when the Chicago White Sox built was is now Guaranteed Rate Field, the ISFA was also used to renovate that stadium and Soldier Field. It still owes more than $400 million on the Soldier Field renovation, which was finished in 2003. It's funded through an existing 2% hotel tax. The Bears' proposal also calls for the ISFA to refinance its existing debt.\n\nThe Bears estimate the project would create 43,000 construction jobs and generate an annual economic impact of $456 million once the project is completed.\n\nWhen asked about the proposal Wednesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and legislative leaders were skeptical of the proposal.\n\n\"I believe strongly that this is not a high priority for legislators and certainly for me when I compare it to all the other things,\" Pritzker, a Democrat, said.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue for a vote on the board right now it would fail and it would fail miserably. There's no environment for something like this today. Now, in Springfield, environments change. Will that environment change within the next 30 days? I think that's highly unlikely,\" said Illinois House Speaker Emmanuel \"Chris\" Welch, D-Hillside.\n\nThe 2024 legislative session is scheduled to end May 24.\n\nWhen asked about potentially waiting until the fall veto session for lawmakers to pass stadium funding legislation, Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said he would prefer to get the legislation done sooner.\n\nIllinois Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, also released a statement Wednesday about the stadium proposal:\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer. But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"\n\nThe Bears funding request comes as the White Sox are asking the state for $1 billion to build a new stadium in Chicago.

Taxpayers were still on the hook for $631 million for Soldier Field debt as of last year.\n\nThe new site would be on what are now parking lots just south of Soldier Field. The colonnades from the old structure would be saved. The proposal is believed to potentially include a hotel and improved access to and from DuSable Lake Shore Drive.\n\nThe Bears bought the former Arlington International Racecourse in Arlington Heights for $197 million last year, and announced plans for a $5 billion mixed-use development with a stadium, housing and entertainment. But the team switched focus back to Chicago this year after property tax negotiations with local school districts broke down.\n\nSeveral other communities, including Naperville and Aurora, also expressed interest in luring the Bears.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson's office declined to comment Monday, but he has recently spoken about having promising conversations with Warren and hinted at unspecified benefits that Chicago would reap from the team's continued presence downtown.\n\nDuring an unrelated news conference last Wednesday, the mayor again said \"ownership has to put some skin in the game\" when asked about the ongoing jockeying for new stadiums by the Bears as well as other Chicago sports teams such as the White Sox. He also maintained there would be no new taxes to help out the franchises.\n\n\"If we're going to build 21st century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire city of Chicago, and these conversations particularly with the Bears have been quite positive,\" Johnson said. \"I appreciate the leadership of Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nThe last part of his statement was in response to a question about a rejected proposal from the White Sox, first reported by Crain's Chicago Business, to use part of the amusement tax to fund new stadiums for the Bears and White Sox, to which Johnson on Wednesday said, \"We didn't like the idea, it was that simple.\"\n\nGov.

It would also include infrastructure improvements to the surrounding green space, added playfields, public restrooms and food and beverage offerings.\n\nSoldier Field would be demolished and replaced with sports fields and gardens, team leaders said.

The Bears would foot half the bill and taxpayers would cover the rest, officials said.\n\nThe team estimates that the new stadium will bring in $8 billion in regional economic impact, along with 43,000 construction jobs and 4,200 new jobs to the metro area. The Bears would use it to host Super Bowls, NCAA championships, concerts and more.\n\n\"Contributing more than $2 billion in private dollars into this new publicly-owned stadium will unlock tremendous economic development opportunities, add jobs for the city and the region, and create a tremendous home field advantage for the Chicago Bears,\" Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren said in a statement.\n\nThe ability to host so many major events also \"means billions of tourism dollars that Chicago currently cannot capture -- helping our city regain its reputation for hosting global events,\" Warren said.\n\nThe team said it would seek out local minority-, women- and veteran-owned construction businesses for the project.\n\nThe plan has the support of Mayor Brandon Johnson, who touted it as way to bring about \"economic growth and community enrichment.\"\n\n\"The proposed stadium, accompanied by expanded open spaces and recreational facilities, exemplifies my administration's commitment to enhancing the quality of life for all Chicagoans.

J.B. Pritzker appear unlikely to do the blocking and tackling necessary to muscle through legislation that would unlock the $900 million in public funding the team says is needed for the project.\n\nThe long-awaited plan, unveiled at a Wednesday press conference at Soldier Field, calls for a $3.2 billion stadium along with at least $325 million but perhaps as much as $1.5 billion for infrastructure upgrades.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The city and state would also be on the hook for the infrastructure bill.\n\nISFA-issued bonds, which were used to build Guaranteed Rate Field and renovate Soldier Field, are backed by an existing 2% city hotel tax.\n\nBonds for those earlier projects are set to expire in 2033. The Bears have proposed issuing new bonds to be paid back over a 40-year period. This would require the approval of state lawmakers.\n\n\"This project will result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago,\" Johnson said in backing public funding, proclaiming that the new stadium had the potential to be \"the crown jewel of the city of Chicago.\"\n\nBears President Kevin Warren, though conceding that \"this is not an easy project,\" said that by working together, the team, city and state can \"create win-win-win situations.\"\n\nBut 15 miles away from the glitzy rollout event, Pritzker and legislative leaders said they remained unconvinced that the Bears' proposal is a \"win\" for taxpayers.\n\n\"I'm highly skeptical of the proposal that's been made and I believe strongly that this is not a high priority for legislators and certainly not for me,\" Pritzker told reporters at an unrelated press conference in Maywood to promote his health insurance reform legislation.\n\nPritzker then observed that voters in Kansas City just rejected a referendum that would have authorized public funding for a new Royals ballpark and renovations to Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs.\n\n\"I don't really think that the people of Chicago or across Illinois feel any different than that,\" Pritzker said, adding that he had not been invited to the Bears' announcement.\n\nHouse Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, at the same event, said that if he \"were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably.\" Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said in a statement that he echoed Pritzker's skepticism.\n\nWarren, however, said \"the time is now\" to get a stadium deal done, insisting that the team will push for a package before lawmakers adjourn their spring session at the end of May and not punt to the fall veto session. He said waiting could cost valuable time, both delaying the stadium's opening date and increasing the overall project cost.\n\nCould the Bears come out of the state Capitol winners in a few weeks? Sure.\n\nEven Welch, who said it is \"highly unlikely\" that the Bears can get the deal they're looking for in this political climate, acknowledged that \"in Springfield, environments change.\"\n\nBut if I were the Bears, I would consider drawing up a new game plan. The same with the White Sox. And the Chicago Red Stars. And any other Illinois team looking for a public subsidy for a new stadium.\n\nAs I wrote last month regarding the White Sox's quest for a new ballpark, the amount of doubt and distaste for public funding in the Capitol should not be underestimated and cannot be overstated.\n\nThat's true in both the House and Senate. But look no further than Pritzker. Illinois' billionaire governor has remained consistent in his general opposition to public subsidies for facilities used by privately owned teams and in his skepticism of the projects that have specifically been floated.\n\nOf course, politicians can changed their minds.\n\nLook at Johnson, a former Chicago Teachers Union organizer elected with heavy support from the progressive grassroots. He opposed subsidies as a candidate last year but flipped to the point of being part of the Bears' rollout announcement on Wednesday.\n\nBut I'm not so sure about Pritzker in this instance. In the 2 1/2 years since he started to be asked about this topic, there's been little deviation off his general position despite shifting plans from the Bears and added wrenches like the Sox's trial balloon.\n\nFor instance, when asked about the possibility of helping to finance a stadium project following the Bears' September 2021 announcement of a purchase agreement for the 326-acre Arlington Park property, Pritzker said \"that's not something that we're looking at.\"\n\nHe was asked again in a gubernatorial debate in October 2022 -- his answer even more to the point: \"Look, I'm a Bears fan. I support the Chicago Bears. But, I do not think that the state should be funding the private development of a stadium anywhere in the state.\"\n\nIn April 2023, Pritzker told reporters in response to a legislative proposal that would lock in the Bears' property tax rates for the now-mothballed Arlington Park development \"that the state really shouldn't be in the business of providing handouts to private industry and that's what the Bears are.\"\n\nWhen the Sox entered the fray earlier this year with a proposal for a publicly-financed ballpark in the city's South Loop neighborhood, Pritzker said that he started out \"really reluctant\" and would be against it \"unless a case is made that the investment yields a long-term return for the taxpayers,\" something he said had not yet been displayed.\n\nIn March, Pritzker said that the Bears' commitment of $2 billion private money towards the project was \"a good first step\" but alone not enough to warrant state involvement in the project.\n\n\"I want to say one more time: We're prioritizing the use of dollars here for people who need it,\" Pritzker said. \"Wealthy owners of sports teams, I respect that they run private businesses and they want them to be profitable and they want constantly to provide better facilities for their customers. But I don't think that should be the highest priority for the state of Illinois.\"\n\nHe may say it a little differently each time, but the message has essentially been the same. In this context, it's hard to see Pritzker moving off such a long-held position in the course of just a few weeks.\n\nNow, there are things the Bears can do to drum up support in the legislature and perhaps turn up pressure on Pritzker and others.\n\nThe smart play is probably to deploy organized labor to help sell the plan. The unions collectively still have enough clout to make a difference under the Capitol dome. They will be incentivized by the promise of thousands of stadium construction jobs to help the Bears and perhaps the Sox.\n\nBut again, if past is prologue, that will not deter Pritzker from his stance.\n\nKevin Warren and the Bears have four weeks to draw up a legislative play in Springfield. But they may need to call an audible.\n\nHistory photos: Chicago's Soldier Field through the years Soldier Field - 2003 Soldier Field - 1971 Soldier Field - 1931 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1987 Soldier Field - 1926 Soldier Field - 1933 Soldier Field - 1928 Soldier Field - 1939 Soldier Field - 1962 Soldier Field - 1946 Soldier Field - 1978 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1943 Soldier Field - 1936 Soldier Field - 1932 Soldier Field - 1961 Soldier Field - 1974 Soldier Field - 1948 Soldier Field - 1927 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1927 Soldier Field - 1973 Soldier Field - 2003\n\nContact Brenden Moore at brenden.moore@lee.net.

Pritzker originally appeared on NBC Sports Chicago\n\nProminent Chicago preservation group Friends of the Parks responded Wednesday to the highly anticipated reveal of the Bears' newest stadium proposal in Chicago, which includes tearing down much of the current Soldier Field in order to build a domed facility and more.\n\nFriends of the Parks, which successfully sued to prevent George Lucas from building a museum along the lakefront, has previously voiced opposition to the construction of any new stadium project on the Museum Campus, where the Bears are proposing their new stadium site.\n\n\"The 'Chicago Way' was on full display at the Chicago Bears news conference today. Once again, Chicago taxpayers are being told what is good for them. We are told that a new domed stadium on protected lakefront land will make Chicago a great city,\" the group said in response to the announcement. \"We are already a great city -- in large part due to our protected lakefront. As is so often the case in Chicago, the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast-track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront.\"\n\nMORE: Friends of the Parks responds to Bears' new stadium proposal\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson joined NBC Sports Chicago's \"Football Night in Chicago\" to respond to the criticism from Friends of the Parks and their concerns for the lakefront ordinance, which prohibits privately invested structures built east of Lakeshore Drive.\n\n\"Well, you know, again, the lakefront protected ordinance, you know, which I'm fully in support of,\" Johnson said. \"I'm confident that we are not in opposition to that ordinance. Again, we're talking about 20% more open [green] space. The amount of investments that are going into creating 14 more acres of space for our children and our young\n\npeople in the city of Chicago to benefit from that.\n\n\"That's been the vision for the lakefront for some time. You know, look, I know that there has been a regular practice in the city of Chicago where things have just been rammed down people's throats. This is a proposal. What we're saying is we have an opportunity to not just keep the Bears in the city of Chicago, but 24,000 jobs, construction jobs just for the people of Chicago. 46,000 construction jobs for the region. 2.5 billion, 3.5 billion in Chicago region of labor income, the type of income that's needed to afford to live in the city of Chicago. That's what this proposal provides.\n\n\"And so I'm looking forward to the continued conversation. And again, this notion that we were going to lose the Bears to another space, we didn't do that. This notion that we could not provide a development with real collaboration for public benefit. We've done that. The fact that we have created public use. We've done that. The fact that we are creating opportunities for our young people, our students and a Catholic League. Like could you imagine, you know, these, high-stakes tournaments where young people get a chance to participate downtown with the lakeshore as the backdrop, on a Saturday night or a Sunday night?\n\n\"Graduations can be held there. There are so many different opportunities that we have at this moment. And make no mistake about it, my job and my responsibility is to make sure that the people of Chicago benefit from any investment. And that's what this proposal does.\"\n\nJohnson and the Bears spoke at Soldier Field Wednesday about their plan for a new stadium. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, according to him, was not invited to the press conference to speak.\n\nHow does Johnson respond to the lack of alignment between the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois?\n\n\"Well, I run the city of Chicago,\" Johnson said. \"I mean, that's my responsibility to people in Chicago voted for me to run the city. And what the city has made very clear is that the public use and the public benefits to transform the lakefront. That has always been my goal. It's not about just keeping the bears in the city of Chicago, which we have a commitment from the Bears to remain in Chicago, but it's also about the transformation that exists there.\n\n\"Now, as far as the next steps, of course, to engage the speaker of the House, the Senate president to engage the governor, to engage the people of Chicago as a whole. That is also part of the process. But we needed to make sure that the Bears organization in my administration were on the same page. And when it comes to investing in this moment, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, we're talking about $3.5 billion of income in four workers.\n\n\"That's transformational. We're also talking about the long-term sustainability of this opportunity to have 20% more open green space, 14 acres of new fields for our young people to be able to participate in. This is a win-win-win for the city of Chicago. And I'm prepared to work as hard as anyone else to ensure that the resources are there to complete this endeavor.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Parks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Johnson_(athlete)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Johnson (athlete)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The team said it would contribute just over $2 billion, ask for $300 million from the NFL, and look to the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority for $900 million. That leaves a gap of about $1.5 billion, and the team would look for public money to make up the difference.\n\nMeanwhile Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson was emphatic in saying there would be no new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nAs Harmon alluded to, Illinois Gov.

Pritzker said he remains \"skeptical\" about the Bears proposal to build a new publicly-owned stadium in Chicago, before the presentation began.\n\n\"I wonder if it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker said. \"It's very important to me that, with all the state needs to accomplish, that we think about what the priorities are for the state... there are a lot of priorities the state has and I'm not sure that this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nThe Bears bought 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights last year, and previously announced plans to build a new stadium there.

Of course, they aren't planning to pay for it themselves.\n\nThe team is planning to reveal plans for a $4.6 billion project to build a new enclosed stadium on the Lake Michigan lakefront area, according to the Chicago Tribune, with the team planning to pledge $2.3 billion to make it happen. That would leave Illinois taxpayers on the hook for $2.3 billion.\n\nFor perspective, that works out to $183 per Illinois resident.\n\nThe stadium itself will reportedly cost $3.2 billion to build, with another $1.4 billion in infrastructure improvements (think public transportation, parking garages, parks). Taxpayers would technically cover the infrastructure improvements and $1 billion in newly borrowed money, which would involve new bonds for the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA).\n\nA $4.6 billion stadium (or a $3.2 billion stadium) would be the second-most expensive stadium in sports history, behind only SoFi Stadium, the home of the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers. That project was funded entirely by Rams owner Stan Kroenke.\n\nThese plans come after the Bears already spent $197 million to buy the Arlington International Racecourse property in Arlington Heights, Ill. They are now apparently set to abandon those plans, with the team reportedly unable to reach an agreement over property taxes with local schools in Arlington Heights.\n\nThe Bears' lease at Soldier Field, which is nearing its 100th birthday, runs through 2033.\n\nThe Bears are pursuing their public funding in parallel to the Chicago White Sox, which have already unveiled plans for a stadium just outside Chicago's South Loop area.\n\nThe price tag was initially reported as $1 billion, but a subsequent interview by team owner Jerry Reinsdorf revealed the price tag would be more around $2 billion. He heavily hinted that Illinois declining to cover the money would endanger the team's future in Chicago.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Bears will employ similar scare tactics, and if anyone would believe them. The teams have recently discussed a financial partnership.\n\nThe Bears and White Sox already had some financial ties, as they both received their most recent major rounds of funding for stadiums via the ISFA.\n\nA 2% hotel tax has been used to pay bonds that covered renovations for Soldier Field and Guaranteed Rate Field, but the debts have outpaced that income. Per the Tribune, taxpayers still owe $629 million on renovations for stadiums that both teams are now trying to abandon while asking Illinois to pay billions to help them to do so.\n\nSome of the proposed borrowing would reportedly be used to roll over that debt, with a plan to pay it off over the course of 40 years.\n\nOne sports economist the Tribune spoke to, J.C. Bradbury, was skeptical of the plan, to say the least:\n\nWe'll see if Illinois legislators have a similar reaction.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Kroenke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stan Kroenke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Loop", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Loop"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R1D7MoMmpP0jQ7pQO48hUw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/33abb730-01d8-11ef-bfff-1e936fc3a883", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The Bears have been playing their home games there since 1970.\n\nThe plan, which would require a long list of government approvals such as using Chicago hotel tax revenue to pay for part of the development, most likely will include the demolition of Soldier Field. The historic colonnades on the east and west sides of the stadium would be preserved somehow and somewhere. They were part of the original Neo-classical design. They pay homage to the ancient Roman Colosseum. The stadium as a whole is an expression of reverence for the men and women who have served in the U.S. military.\n\nThe stadium opened on Oct. 9, 1924, to serve as a space where a variety of events such as athletic competitions, exhibitions and other gatherings could be held. It was not intended to become a stadium for football. That came a few years later.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday will be the start of one of the biggest weeks in the 105-year history of the Bears professional football team.\n\nThe Bears, due to its poor records of the last few years, have the No. 1 pick in the draft that will be held from this Thursday to Saturday in Detroit. They plan to choose 22-year-old quarterback Caleb Sequan Williams who played his college football at the University of Oklahoma and the University of Southern California. Williams won the Heisman Trophy and several other awards with USC in 2022 after throwing for over 4,500 yards with 52 total touchdowns. Construction of a new stadium along the lakefront would take several years to complete. Added to the mix is the Chicago White Sox proposal for a new stadium in the same area as well.\n\nIn the end, the state of Illinois would own one or both of the new arenas. The Chicago Park District would retain ownership of Soldier Field. Once it's demolished, the land would become lacrosse, softball and other fields for public enjoyment. The roof of the arena would not be retractable due to Chicago's precarious weather throughout the year. While the Bears football season generally runs from August to the end of the year, the new stadium would host events like concerts, professional soccer games, shows, and other gatherings year-round.", "source": {"uri": "journal-topics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@journal-topics.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "todd_wessell@journal-topics.com", "name": "Todd Wessell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naming rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_High_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mile High Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lacrosse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Park_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Park District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oklahoma", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Oklahoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.journal-topics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/homepage_banner_3.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Friends of the Parks most certainly will continue in its historic role of fending off attempts to develop real estate on the people's lakefront for private interests.\" [...]\n\n\"We had that period where we were focused on Arlington,\" Bears CEO/President Kevin Warren told NBC's Peter King on his podcast. \"We have some issues to work on. There's a possibility there. But one of the things I promised myself and promised the McCaskeys is that I would come in and take a fresh look at what's the right thing to do.\n\n* Friends of the Parks and the Bears sat down in March.

[...]\n\nAfter the meeting, both parties issued statements acknowledging the meeting but did not provide specifics on what was discussed.\n\n\"The Chicago Bears met with Friends of the Parks to discuss our mutual dedication to Chicago and our deep love for our city's parks and lakefront area. We look forward to continuing to work together to strengthen our city,\" a Bears spokesman said in a statement.\n\n\"Friends of the Parks had the opportunity to sit down with the Chicago Bears and hear their vision for a new stadium.

We look forward to future meetings and conversations with a broader group of stakeholders,\" Friends of the Parks said through a spokesperson.\n\n* Yesterday, Friends of the Parks responded to the Chicago Bears news conference...\n\nThe \"Chicago Way\" was on full display at the Chicago Bears news conference today. Once again, Chicago taxpayers are being told what is good for them. We are told that a new domed stadium on protected lakefront land will make Chicago a great city. We are already a great city -- in large part due to our protected lakefront. As is so often the case in Chicago,the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront.\n\nMeanwhile, the communities we work with who are addressing immigrant issues, homelessness, school closures, affordable housing, public safety, equitable transportation, and lack of jobs are fighting for parity-including at our Chicago Park District parks.\n\nWe are all being asked to trust the process and accept that it will, in fact, be Bear-a-dice. Yet, Chicago has a long history of, closed-door planning and rushed decision-making that does not end well for taxpayers. Just look at The Lincoln Yards, The 78, a Chicago casino, and the infamous parking meter deal. Each of these was going to make Chicago into a \"world class\" city and be a \"win-win-win\" for residents.\n\nThe questions everyone needs to ask of the Bears organization and our elected officials are:\n\nThis is a time for some thoughtful, deliberate and civic engagement. A civil, community-driven conversation should be at the forefront of any action the city of Chicago takes regarding the lakefront.\n\nWe did not hear anything at the Bears news conference that could not take place at another Chicago location. We have too many questions to make any decision about the value of these plans. We encourage the Bears and the administration to act with \"honor, integrity, transparency, wisdom and to be forward thinking and collaborative\" and not repeat past mistakes.\n\n* WTTW...\n\nA city ordinance prohibits private development east of DuSable Lake Shore Drive. But, Mayor Johnson told reporters Wednesday at Soldier Field that he is confident a new lakefront stadium would not violate that rule.\n\n\"Bringing the open space better access to the museums, providing better traffic flow, in and out, creating jobs, making opportunities for our young people, that of the vision that I have for the city of Chicago is very much tethered to Burnham ,\" Johnson said. [...]\n\nJohnson was also hit with questions about the potential for lawsuits from Friends of the Parks, who previously sued to help prevent a George Lucas lakefront museum.\n\n\"What we're preparing to do is continue to invest in people,\" the mayor said. \"We're prepared to put 23,000, 24,000 people in the city of Chicago to work.\"\n\n* Daily Herald...", "source": {"uri": "capitolfax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rich Miller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Parks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_King_(sportswriter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter King (sportswriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_78", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The 78"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Herald_(Arlington_Heights,_Illinois)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Yards_(development)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Yards (development)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTTW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTTW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Park_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Park District"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Shore_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Shore Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_ordinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local ordinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Defunct", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Defunct", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

But as everyone knows, this is an evolving situation, and once we have a clear, definitive path, we will have a clear, definitive commitment.\n\nThe statement added, \"We are aware of the importance of the overall package, beginning with the incredible benefits a new stadium at The 78 would bring to the city.\"\n\nThe statement did not define \"significant.\" But sources close to negotiations say Reinsdorf has mentioned a figure of $200 million or more.\n\nThe 78 property at Roosevelt and Clark is owned by Related Midwest, which would develop the stadium and promised residential and commercial space in a move it says would give a jolt of energy to an underdeveloped area skirting the south branch of the Chicago River. Reinsdorf previously has said he intends to invest in the residential/commercial portion of the project, but has not discussed injecting his own funds in the ballpark itself.\n\nUnder his proposal, ISFA would build and own the stadium. The team would pay rent, but construction costs would be financed by an existing tax on Chicago hotel stays and by growth in sales-tax receipts in the stadium area.\n\nThe Bears also are believed seeking to tap the hotel tax, but also have offered to put up $2 billion toward the estimated $4.2 billion cost of the stadium on a parking lots just south of Soldier Field and related infrastructure. Sources close to the deal say the Bears would get that money not from the pockets of the team-owning McCaskey family but mostly from fans in the form of seat-purchase licenses, from the sale of naming rights to the new facility, and from a stadium-construction fund operated by the National Football League.\n\nMajor League Baseball has no similar fund, and Reinsdorf's team plays at least 81 home games a year compared to a minimum of 10 regular and pre-season games for the Bears. But the NFL team lately has been quicker on the public relations draw, announcing today that it will disclose details of its proposal at a high-level VIP event at Soldier Field on April 24.\n\nReinsdorf's offer to open his wallet also comes after a recent statement from Mayor Brandon Johnson that the billionaire needs to \"put some skin in the game\" to advance his stadium plan. At the same time, Johnson has had a series of what are described as cordial talks with Bears owners and officials about their plans.\n\nIt's not clear whether the financing frameworks being advanced by either team will be sufficient to satisfy Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who harbors national political ambitions and has said he's leery about giving taxpayer subsidies to wealth sporting team owners.\n\nThe Bears have hoped to pass a needed authorization measure in the spring session of the General Assembly. But that increasingly appears to be a long shot with lawmakers girding for fall elections and preparing to adjourn for the summer around Memorial Day.\n\nThe Bears at one point seemed set on moving to Arlington Heights and purchased the site of the former Arlington International Racecourse.

Many fans said they are looking forward to a new stadium, although some have mixed feelings about the proposed location change from Arlington Heights.\n\nFor Robby Glick, owner of the Bears fan hub Reggie's, the stadium staying on the lakefront means good business. Shuttles from the bar at 2105 S. State St. take as many as 900 people to and from Soldier Field on game days.\n\n\"Them staying there is great for us, but as a fan, I would not want the Bears to move out of the city of Chicago,\" said Glick, 60. \"Hopefully they learned their lesson because I was a season ticket holder and they didn't get much right with the current stadium.\"\n\nGlick and other fans said Soldier Field is lacking in several areas, with not enough parking, bad concessions and long bathroom lines, among other complaints. He hopes they do better with the new stadium, adding that the renderings look \"phenomenal.\"\n\nWith the fixed dome roof, Glick is optimistic Chicago will get a Super Bowl soon -- and that he won't have to freeze during colder months of the season.\n\nCourtney Fong, a Bears fan from the Northern suburbs who runs a season ticket holders Facebook group, said he's hopeful the stadium will mean more opportunities to host big events and bring more revenue and jobs to the city.\n\n\"I'll still say that I think that the Bears will play in the Super Bowl before we host one,\" he said.\n\nThe Bears' plans also include developing the surrounding area with a hotel, bars and restaurants, and taxpayer funded improvements to roads and other infrastructure make the area more accessible.\n\nFor some fans, more development makes the area more of a destination. Tim Shanley, founder of the Chicago Bears Tailgate Club, lives in Austin, Texas, but flies in for every home game. Shanley, 64, said that development could be \"a gamechanger.\"\n\n\"If you've ever been to a Bears game, you know how hard it is to get there, it's like it's on an island,\" Shanley said. \"To have all that in there, the whole package like that, to revitalize the area, I think it's a smart idea.\"\n\nBut others worry it will come at the expense of parking and will increase congestion.\n\n\"Traffic has already been a mess down there, and with all of the adjacent things, it's great that we'll have more space, but it also means more people,\" Fong said.\n\nSpace is one reason some fans feel conflicted about the Bears' decision not to move forward with the Arlington Heights location.\n\nDennis Lindley, 53, from Aurora, said he has mixed feelings about the stadium plans. While he said he enjoys the lakefront games, Arlington Heights would have some benefits.\n\n\"I think there'll be more room potentially out in Arlington Heights for parking lots and tailgates, to meet up with friends before the game,\" Lindley said. \"We have friends come in from Wisconsin and Indiana, Iowa, all the time, and it's a chance to meet, but in Chicago it's difficult.\"\n\nAlthough the funding for the plan remains unclear and it could require some taxpayer dollars, some fans said the revenue it will generate and improvements to the area justify it. Glick said with the events a domed stadium can host, the cost will be worth it.\n\n\"One way or another, I guess we're all kind of paying for it because it's gonna raise the prices,\" Lindley said. \"But I do still think it's a win-win.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_ticket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Season ticket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_Heights,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington Heights, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lindley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Lindley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aurora, Illinois"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20bd5c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1169x667+0+97/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F69%2F37%2F055375fc4c68a96cd2e6977ddac2%2Fimg-9577.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

J.B. Pritzker, who earlier in the day repeated his skepticism of a plan that relies on public funding.\n\nBut Bears team President and CEO Kevin Warren called it \"a special day.\"\n\nJohnson said the project would \"result in no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\" He and Warren rattled off the community benefits and big-name events the project would bring, like Super Bowls, Final Fours and concerts.\n\nThe stadium would be owned by the Chicago Park District, the team said.\n\nKaren Murphy, the team's executive vice president of stadium development and chief operating officer, said the project would cost more than $4.6 billion. The stadium would cost $3.225 billion with up to $1.4 billion for infrastructure.\n\nThe Bears would commit more than $2 billion to what she called one of the biggest private investments into a public facility in Illinois history. All of the team's investment would pay for 72% of the stadium itself, with a Chicago hotel tax helping fund the rest plus all the infrastructure costs.\n\nThe project would require an increase in bonding by the Illinois State Facilities Bonding Authority.\n\nThe proposal includes 14 acres of athletic fields and recreational park space, with restrooms for the public.

The historic columns, which are part of the architecture that \"pays homage to the men and women who valiantly served the country,\" according to Landmarks Illinois, remain in the renderings.\n\n\"Sports fields and gardens will replace the current stadium, with Soldier Field's historic colonnades preserved as a tribute to Chicago's military veterans,\" the team said in a release. \"An enclosed stadium is essential for Chicago to attract year-round events like the Super Bowl and major concerts -- unlocking billions in tourism revenue.\"\n\n\"As you noticed here, the plan is to keep the historical columns from Soldier Field to make that part of this development to make it one museum campus,\" Bears CEO/President Kevin Warren said during a visual presentation of the renderings. \"What happens here is the additional open and green space. This will have 14 acres of athletic fields, a recreational park to allow, as I mentioned earlier, for youth to be able to come together and do things in a productive manner.\"\n\nAs for the transition to the new stadium, Warren said the Bears will play at Soldier Field until the construction of the new stadium is complete for them to play in.\n\n\"One of the things that makes the project unique is that we would be able to continue to play at Soldier Field during the construction and then to be able to move into the new stadium once the construction is finalized,\" Warren said. \"So yes, we would be able to continue to play here and not have to move to a different location.\"\n\nSoldier Field earned historical landmark status in 1987 but lost its status in 2006 as a result of renovations made to the stadium in 2003.

The stadium will have a translucent roof and massive windows showcasing the Chicago skyline. The surrounding development includes more than a dozen acres of green space including athletic fields and public parks and phased-in infrastructure improvements to the lakefront campus.\n\nThe stadium proposal calls for a $2 billion investment from the Bears, with a $300 million loan from the National Football League and a $900 million debt sale from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which collects a 2% tax on hotel stays.\n\n\"For any new development project at the lakefront, we required real private investment, real public use and real economic participation for the entire city,\" Johnson said. \"Today's announcement delivers on all three.\"\n\nThe project's related infrastructure would be funded in stages, with $325 million initially required for transportation, roadways and utility improvements, according to the presentation from team officials. Phase two would include $510 million for parking, the expansion of the bus depot and new parks and athletic fields. An optional third stage would provide $665 million for further transit improvements, retail space and public attractions. Officials said they were exploring a range of funding options from state, local and federal officials.\n\n\"Now is the time to act,\" said Karen Murphy, executive vice president for stadium development for the Bears. The cost of the project rises by more than $150 million every year it gets delayed partly because inflation, she estimated.\n\nJohnson lauded the Bears' $2 billion commitment to the project as one of the largest private investments in the city's history. He said there will not be any new or raised taxes on Chicago residents. Kevin Warren, president of the Bears, said the team is seeking to be fiscally responsible in its plans, noting it opted for a fixed roof, instead of a retractable one given the cost.\n\nThe stadium would be designed by Manica Architecture, the firm behind Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and the new Nissan Stadium in Tennessee. Supporting 43,000 construction jobs, the project will be the largest building project in the region's history, according to the Bear's presentation. The team estimates the development will bring $8.4 billion in regional economic impact -- though economists say such projections are often inflated.\n\nPublic Dollars for Pro Sports\n\nThe plan comes as public financing for professional sports stadiums faces skepticism from taxpayers in other cities. Earlier this month, Kansas City voters rejected a proposal to fund a downtown ballpark for their Major League Baseball franchise and pay for improvements to Arrowhead Stadium, home to their Super-Bowl-winning team, the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWhile Chicago is known as a sports town, the nation's third-largest city also has a history of shaky finances. The city's pensions are short more than $35 billion after years of chronic underfunding, and more than 80% of property-tax dollars go toward retirement payouts.\n\nIllinois has the worst credit rating among US states, with massive pension debts and a history of budget deficits, though its finances have steadied in recent years. Money for the stadium project will run up against other priorities.\n\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has previously said public funding for stadiums isn't a priority for his administration. Speaking at an unrelated event on Wednesday, Pritzker reiterated his reluctance to provide public dollars to finance a stadium even though he is a Bears fan.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" he said. \"The owners of these private businesses need to put a lot more forward in order to have their dreams fulfilled and not just rely upon the taxpayers of Illinois to make that happen for them.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Illinois House Speaker Chris Welch said while the speaker is happy to continue engaging in conversations with Chicago's professional sports teams, \"in the current legislative environment, with many important budget pressures, there hasn't been a strong appetite for these projects.\"\n\n--With assistance from Randall Williams.\n\n(Updates with context throughout including comments from Illinois governor.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Public subsidies would make up the difference, and taxpayers would also be on the hook for $1.5 billion in infrastructure work that would be build over three phases.\n\nJohnson's endorsement puts him far beyond the hesitance to subsidize professional stadiums expressed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker and other state leaders who will be responsible for approving the plan.\n\nIt also puts political pressure on Johnson to deliver votes in Springfield to help the Bears and could become a very public defeat if the stadium deal falls apart.\n\nWarren said today \"the time is now\" and confirmed the team is pushing for approval this spring with just five weeks left in the legislative session.\n\n\"Time is money and we do need to figure this out,\" Warren said.\n\nJohnson said the Bears \"put real skin in the game\" and championed the jobs and public amenities that would come along with the new stadium.\n\n\"This is a real opportunity to create real revenue by doing what works, which is putting people to work,\" he said. \"This is very much aligned towards and aligned with my vision for a better, stronger, safer Chicago because it invests in people, it invests in households.\"\n\nAhead of the stadium announcement, Pritzker reiterated his skepticism of providing subsidies for professional stadiums, saying \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for the state.\"\n\nThe statement was echoed by State Senate President Don Harmon and House Speaker Chris Welch, with both noting they were encouraged by the Bears initial private investment offer.\n\nJohnson declined to answer a question about what he'll tell Pritzker to support the plan, but said he appreciates \"the feedback that is coming from our state partners.\"\n\nHe also sought to downplay the taxpayer dollars at stake in the project, saying no new taxes or increases to existing taxes were included in the Bears' plans.\n\nWhen the Bears and Johnson arrive in Springfield, they won't be alone. The Bears rolled out their proposal before elected officials, business and labor leaders.\n\nThey'll argue the tax revenue and jobs created by the project are worth the public investment. The Bears are also relying on civic boosterism, arguing the domed stadium would be able to host the Super Bowl, college football games and the college basketball's Final Four, both women's and men's. The team also teased musical artists had expressed interest in signing up for weeks-long residencies.\n\nSupport could also come from the City Council. Ald. Walter Burnett, 27th, who doubles as Johnson's vice mayor, said people shouldn't underestimate the large Chicago delegation in the General Assembly, arguing \"most people in Springfield don't want to be on the side of the Bears potentially not being in the city of Chicago.\"\n\nMuch of the approvals needed to greenlight the project rest with state leaders, but the city's tax revenue would not be left unbothered if the Bears' plans become reality.\n\nAs it is now, the city would remain the ultimate guarantor of the annual debt service payments made by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority as part of the plan.\n\nJill Jaworski, the city's chief financial officer, told reporters after the event she'd be \"very pleased\" if the state took on that burden, but acknowledged it's unlikely. But Jaworski argued the Bears proposal still represents a better deal for the city.\n\nCurrently, the ISFA makes annual debt payments to pay down bonds issued to build Guaranteed Rate Field and renovate Soldier Field through revenue from a 2% tax on hotel stays in Chicago. When that revenue falls short, the difference is made up through state tax revenue that otherwise would have been sent to Chicago.\n\nJaworski said current ISFA debt payments are modeled on an anticipated 5.5% annual growth in revenue from the hotel tax, but the Bears' model is more modest at 4%. The team's plan also includes an $150 to $160 million liquidity reserve fund that could be set aside and tapped during down years.\n\n\"By assuming a lower rate, we're not building that debt service up so high, and then by adding that liquidity reserve for really down years to provide funding, we feel we're much less at risk\" she said.\n\nJaworski said the Bears' debt plan is not backloaded like the structure created by former Mayor Richard M. Daley to renovate Soldier Field that has the city looking at massive payments in the coming years.\n\nThe White Sox plan\n\nRefinancing the ISFA's current debt, providing $900 million to the Bears and establishing the reserve fund would not provide a cent to the Chicago White Sox, who are pursuing their own new ballpark in the South Loop. The Sox plan includes tapping into the ISFA to the tune of over $1 billion.\n\nMarc Ganis, a Chicago-based sports marketing expert who founded Sportscorp, said, \"I would be very surprised if the White Sox are not on the phone with their lobbyists and state legislators today saying 'wait a minute, that tax source was originally approved for the White Sox and now you're saying once our lease is done, we're not getting any of it.\"\n\nJohnson has met with White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf but has not embraced the team's stadium plans because, until this week, Reinsdorf had not signaled he would provide any of his own equity into the project.\n\nJaworski recently rejected an idea from the Sox to use a portion of the revenue the city receives from ticket sales at the new stadiums to help pay for them. Ganis said additional tax revenue would have to be added to the pot to raise enough cash for both team's stadiums.\n\nHe also cast doubt on the state's willingness to approve any money for stadium deals, saying Harmon gave the teams the \"blueprint for getting this approved\" and the teams are largely ignoring the advice.\n\n\"Never say never when it comes to Springfield,\" he said. \"That being said, I think Sen. Harmon's plan is the only one that might get done this year.

The Staleys won the 1921 league championship. A year later, the team was renamed the Bears.\n\nThe Bears primarily have played home games at Wrigley Field and then Soldier Field, but a sprinkling of other venues also have hosted the team. Here's a look back at them -- and how the Bears have fared on those turfs.\n\nRecord: 221-89-22 (Two of the regular season victories came with the Bears as the \"road\" team against the Chicago Tigers)\n\nThe Bears played at Wrigley Field, previously known as Cubs Park, for their first five decades in Chicago. The team won nearly 70% of its home games during that span.\n\nWrigley Field is where University of Illinois star Harold \"Red\" Grange played his first game for the Bears on Nov. 26, 1925, in front of 36,000 fans. (The Bears and Cardinals fought to a scoreless tie, with Grange gaining 36 yards on the ground.) It's also where the Bears became the first team in the championship era (since 1933) to win back-to-back titles by routing the Giants 37-9 on Dec. 21, 1941. And where \"Kansas Comet\" Gale Sayers scored six touchdowns -- tying an NFL record -- as a rookie in a 61-20 win against the San Francisco 49ers on Dec. 12, 1965.\n\nIn 1921, the Bears, then known as the Staleys, won the American Professional Football Association title. And it wouldn't be their last. While at Wrigley, the Bears would win NFL titles in 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946 and 1963.\n\nThe team played its last game at Wrigley Field on Dec. 13, 1970. The NFL had been pressuring the Bears to move because seating capacity was less than 50,000 -- one of the parameters the league created after the AFL-NFL merger -- and because the stadium lacked lights. Jack Concannon had his best game in the finale as a Bear, throwing four touchdown passes and scoring a fifth, in a 35-17 win over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nThe Bears, known as the Staleys then, returned to their birthplace of Decatur to play the Rock Island Independents on Oct. 10, 1921.\n\n\"Six thousand former service men and visitors attending the American Legion convention,\" observed the game, the Tribune reported. The Bears won 14-10.\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nAs the home team, the Bears went undefeated at the Sheffield Avenue facility. They beat the Hammond Pros 28-7 on Oct. 11, 1925.\n\nMilton Romney, a University of Chicago graduate and first cousin once removed of Sen. Mitt Romney, started as a fullback opposite Notre Dame grad Johnny Mohardt.\n\nRecord: 0-0-1\n\n\"Ten thousand opening-day fans watched the elevens struggle up and down the dusty gridiron to a scoreless tie,\" the Tribune reported.\n\nThe Bears met the Brooklyn Dodgers at the West Side stadium on Sept. 21, 1930. Both teams managed to rack up 15 first downs, but no points. Bears fullback Bronko Nagurski recovered a fumble late in the game, but the Bears' final effort to score was halted at Brooklyn's goal line.\n\nGrange scored the Bears' first touchdown of the season \"when he crashed off Cleveland's left tackle on a delayed plunge,\" the Tribune reported.\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nSnow and freezing temperatures turned Wrigley into the North (Side) Pole and forced the Bears vs. Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans game for the NFL title indoors at Chicago Stadium to play on a 60-yard field before more than 11,000 fans. It was the first NFL game to be played indoors, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 1932, the Bears won 9-0 for their second title.\n\nThe 1932 NFL championship. Indoors at Chicago Stadium. How one of the strangest -- and most influential -- games in Bears history changed the league.\n\nBears owner Virginia Halas McCaskey was a seventh grader at the time and had a lasting memory of the game.\n\n\"Just the odor,\" she said with a laugh during a Tribune interview in March 2019. \"It was almost overwhelming because the circus had just left town.\"\n\nDespite winning 20-16, reviews of the Bears' performance were brutal.\n\n\"The Bears committed almost every possible type of football sin. They were penalized for almost every foul in the book,\" Tribune sports editor Cooper Rollow wrote.\n\nEvanston didn't think much of the Bears either. Residents petitioned city officials to block the Bears from moving there. The Bears signed a five-year deal with Northwestern in early 1971, but the Big Ten Conference denied permission for the team to lease Dyche Stadium two weeks later.\n\nRecord: 234-176-2\n\nThe Bears relocated to Soldier Field -- where they had played on occasion previously, including as the \"away team\" against the Cardinals in 1926 -- for the start of the 1971 season. The team chose it over Comiskey Park. With the exception of one season in 2002 during stadium renovations, the downtown Chicago stadium on the lakefront has been their home ever since.\n\nThe new era began with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, 17-15 on Sept. 19, 1971, in the rain. Capacity was cut to 57,000 fans.\n\nChicago's Soldier Field: A timeline of events since 1924, including hosting the world's athletes, congregations, politicians and performers\n\nSoldier Field is where Walter Payton pummeled the Minnesota Vikings for 275 yards on Nov. 20, 1977, breaking O.J. Simpson's single-game NFL record of 273 yards on a 4-yard, fourth-down, fourth-quarter run that was stopped short of the first down. On Dec. 16, 1979 to news that George \"Mugs\" Halas, Jr., team president and son of the owner/founder, had died unexpectedly overnight, the Bears rallied to rout the St. Louis Cardinals 42-6 and earn a wild-card berth. Other memorable moments include a 61-7 win over the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 7, 1980 (though the Bears were eliminated from playoff contention after the Minnesota Vikings beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). And a 20-12 win over the Eagles in the 1988 NFC playoffs known as \"The Fog Bowl.\"\n\nA championship didn't come easily, or quickly, to Soldier Field's residents. It took 14 seasons for the Bears to bring a title home, winning Super Bowl XX in 1986 with a 46-10 rout of the New England Patriots. It was the team's ninth and most recent title. The Bears did earn a dramatic trip to Super Bowl XLI by defeating the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC championship game on Jan. 21, 2007, at Soldier Field -- and the George Halas Trophy was presented to Halas' daughter and team owner Virginia McCaskey.\n\nRecord: 3-5\n\nWhile Mayor Richard M. Daley and the Chicago Park District were busy remodeling Soldier Field, the Bears moved down to Champaign to play \"home\" games at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.\n\nNote: The Bears often played at Comiskey Park and Normal Park, but the Cardinals were the home team.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The hosts asked Hayes to react to the presentation Bears CEO Kevin Warren made yesterday -- a glitzy pitch to build a domed stadium on the lakefront just south of the team's current home, Soldier Field.\n\n\"It's pretty clear based on Kevin Warren's stated desire to remain on the lakefront that that's their first option,\" Hayes said. \"We're very happy to be Plan B or Plan 1A, whatever you want to call it at this point. We're waiting in the wings if they do get a 'no' on the lakefront,\" he added, alluding to the potential obstacles to the Bears current plan. Those obstacles include a possible legal challenge from advocacy group Friends of the Parks as well as a potential rejection of the Bears' public subsidy asks in Springfield.\n\nIn a similar vein, school districts that would serve the residential development earlier envisioned for the Bears' property in Arlington Heights have challenged tax breaks for the team, but Hayes said he believes those are short-term issues that can be \"easily resolved if the Bears do get a 'no' on the lakefront and turn back in our direction.\"\n\nThe Bears made a deal to purchase the Arlington Heights property for $197.2 million while Ted Phillips was still CEO, and closed on the purchase in 2023 after laying out an ambitious plan for residential, retail and entertainment developments in addition to the stadium. That plan took advantage of the site's built-in Metra access as well as proximity to highways. The 326-acre site has been razed and is now development-ready.\n\nSince then, Warren has replaced Phillips and shifted the team's priority to the lakefront. One hitch for the Bears, even under Warren's leadership, is that the team won't own a stadium on Chicago Park District land, Hayes pointed out.\n\n\"What the Bears told us from Day One was that they were looking to own their own stadium and to build ... a dining and entertainment district and provide a game day experience that would provide substantially more revenue than what they are realizing at Soldier Field down on the lakefront.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagobusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's Chicago Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

I have, and I can't say it's comparable to seeing the renderings.\n\nChicago Bears release images of a proposed new lakefront stadium\n\nBut they did look kind of cool, just as the renderings for the proposed White Sox Park in the South Loop looked terrific. I'm guessing the renderings of the new Comiskey Park and the Soldier Field renovation also looked cool when they were revealed, because anything new and futuristic looking is bound to appear better than the status quo.\n\nMaybe there will even be more bathrooms, and video boards that you won't have to crane your neck to see?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nNaturally, Gov. J.B. Pritzker immediately threw cold water on the Bears' and Johnson's big day, saying he was \"skeptical\" and wondering \"whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers.\" That's the easiest way to put the kibosh on the project without actually looking into whether it would be a good thing for the city and the McCaskeys, the public and private part of the public-private venture.\n\nFunding should not be an issue. Warren told the Tribune editorial board that the 30-year bonds for U.S. Bank Stadium, which he got built in Minnesota, were paid off 23 years ahead of schedule because of revenues from e-pull tabs, a gambling game that's like a lottery ticket.\n\nEditorial: The Bears may stir Chicago's blood with splashy pitch for a lakefront stadium. We're not convinced.\n\nIf extending the 2% hotel tax for another 40 years is a problem for Pritzker, perhaps the Bears can instead propose an added 2% tax on adult-use cannabis sales in Illinois. That should pay off the bonds for the new stadium in no time, as anyone who ever got a contact high from strolling through the tailgate parties on the Waldron Deck, the proposed site of the stadium, can attest.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Park likely will try to butt in, as they did when they drove away the last billionaire who wanted to build something -- a \"Star Wars\" themed museum -- on our cherished lakefront.\n\nBut this is not an ego-driven project promoting an overrated sci-fi movie that appeals only to nerds. This is our beloved Bears, even though they're owned by the not-so-beloved McCaskeys. Who elected these \"Friends\" anyways? Can't they find something to do inside for once in their lives?\n\nTime is of the essence, the Bears warned us, with the cost expected to go up by $150 million or so every wasted year without a shovel in the ground.\n\nIf you can't bear the idea of helping out the billionaire McCaskeys, do it for all the kids who would benefit from what was touted as 20% more open space from the removal of the crashed spaceship and turning the current field into a park -- albeit with better sod, I'm guessing.\n\nOr think about Johnson's inauguration ceremony at the new stadium, as he bizarrely fantasized about Wednesday during his rambling pep-rally speech that ended with the words \"God bless the greatest freaking city in the world.\"\n\nThat's our mayor, an orator for the ages.\n\nOr think about poor Beyonce not having to worry about performing in the rain, as almost happened last summer, we were informed at the presentation. Not only would the new translucent roof protect fans from dreaded \"Bear weather,\" it would keep pop stars such as Beyonce and Swift warm and dry.\n\nThere are so many reasons to get this done it boggles the mind, and the sooner the better before the White Sox ask for their handout.\n\nThe No. 1 reason, of course, is the possibility of a getting Super Bowl down the road.\n\n\"How many people would love to come to a Super Bowl in Chicago?\" Johnson asked, before answering his own question:\n\n\"Everyone.\"\n\nA week in Chicago in February over Phoenix or Miami? It's a no-brainer.\n\nThere were plenty of unanswered questions about financing, parking, tailgating, PSLs and whether anyone will be able to find the Uber lot after a game. The 1.4-mile walk from the Roosevelt Road \"L\" station would still be a half-hour to the Waldron Deck site, but maybe they'll have room in the infrastructure budget for a people mover.\n\nAnyway, Bears, you had me at \"Fear the roar.\"\n\nSo bye-bye, spaceship, and so long, Bear weather.\n\nAs Burnham said: Make no little plans when you can have a translucent roof instead.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0

It will be featured in a huge project that would completely change the look of the Chi's lakefront, and quite frankly, the whole thing is gorgeous.\n\nBut there's one major problem: The franchise wants public funding to make the stadium a reality. Um ... come again?\n\nThe Bears want exactly $3.2 billion to build the stadium, as well as an extra $1.5 billion for infrastructure. The project will add green, open space, improve access to the Museum Campus and also feature a publicly owned hotel -- nothing at all that affects the public directly. Well, other than the taxpayer being sucked dry.

Chicago might wanna think about that one, taxes are already killing them as it is (and the rest of America at that).", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_powell@dailycaller.com", "name": "Andrew Powell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgeous_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gorgeous (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penei_Sewell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penei Sewell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Gay_Men", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Gay Men", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Bearings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Bearings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft_Toys", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Soft Toys", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Stuffed_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Stuffed Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 33}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2552652-scaled-e1714007578777.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The stadium's historic colonnades would be preserved.\n\nWhile Mayor Brandon Johnson has supported it, Gov. JB Pritzker, park advocates and other local officials slammed the idea of building a facility on public parkland and using taxpayer dollars for the project.\n\nWe asked you what you thought. Here's what you said. Some responses have been edited for clarity.\n\n\"Love the new stadium proposal! While I prefer an open air stadium, they need this for hosting big events and the city can't lose the bears and opportunity to host events Downtown.\" -Dan, West Town\n\n\"I do love the idea of a Downtown domed stadium, mostly because of the opportunity to host the Super Bowl or Final Four. Wish it was retractable because indoor football really sucks, especially when most of the fall weather is amazing. I question if they really will be able to make getting in and out better. Parking is not going to be sufficient nor the space to tailgate. Why not build this sucker where the Sox want to move? The synergy of what they have in Baltimore is amazing with the Ravens and the O's parks right near each other. In general, I think the lakefront location is really dumb. There's so many other spaces in proximity to Downtown that are not as difficult to get in and out of.\" -Paul Moretta\n\n\"My thoughts. NO, JUST NO. The Chicago Bears can afford to build somewhere else, not on the lakefront and without using any public/government money. Arlington Heights would be fine, they already have the land and a Metra station. Also, they should be required to return Soldier Field to its landmark status.\" -Michael, Logan Square\n\n\"The upgrade to Museum Campus, from the green space to the new dome, looks wonderful. But I think the administration is being disingenuous about funding.\n\n\"It's the same with changes to school funding. We can't spend more money without either cutting elsewhere or raising funds (or both).\n\n\"The playbook seems to be: 1. Announce something new that will undoubtedly cost extra funds. 2. Hand wave concerns about where the money will come from.\n\n\"TBD how successful this approach will be.\" -Walter, University Village\n\n\"It is well documented that the financial returns on large stadiums is poor.\n\n\"When you have a city like Chicago, the returns will likely cost several generations of taxpayers. City officials stated how many jobs and all the benefits of the 2002 Soldier Field renovation. In the name of the taxpayers, they borrowed $398 million. Twenty-two years later, we now owe $640 million, and by the time it is supposed to be paid off in about 10 years it will have cost taxpayers $1.1 billion. (Editor note: The outstanding tab was $640 million as of 2022. It is around $584 million now, according to NBC Chicago).\n\n\"Mayor Brandon has already proven himself to be fiscally irresponsible with the deals and borrowing he's done already.\n\n\"This should be put up to a referendum on this November's ballot. The taxpayers should decide if we want to saddle ourselves with billlions more in debt.\" -Leon Greenberg, Lakeview East\n\n\"If they are going to spend all that money why can't it be a retractable roof?\" -Travis Schulz, Old Town\n\n\"As a Chicago taxpayer, I'm totally opposed to any public funding of a new Bears stadium. This is their stadium that they will profit from. They should pay for it, like the Cubs paid for their Wrigley renovations. Period.\n\n\"I'm also opposed to demolishing Soldier Field. I consider it an iconic Chicago landmark.\" -Dennis Davis, Jefferson Park\n\n\"Possibly the most vulgar plan to reach into taxpayers' pockets I can imagine. And that's before we get to the premise of grabbing public parkland that even they acknowledge to be the most attractive in the world.\" -Wayne Hoppe, Gold Coast\n\n\"Seems to have missed the mark aesthetically and only 65,000 seats? The green space is too busy ... jumbled ... the museum campus is classical and symmetrical and widely spaced.\n\n\"Why not make the Soldier Field space also suitable for concerts in 20,000 range so Huntington Bank Pavilion on Northerly Island could be returned to green space? Also major festivals could move here from neighborhood parks. Also can't hotel and sports museum go west of Lake Shore Drive on land at 16th Street? There is already an underpass, with another underpass at 13th Street. Current plan needs major re-work.\" -George Spalek, Lakeview\n\n\"Before the McCaskeys/Bears get one penny from the city, the existing bonds should be paid off, with significant assistance from the Bears. Unlikely, I realize. I don't like the idea of millionaires/billionaires getting money from the taxpayers in sweetheart deals. Studies have shown the benefits to the hosting city usually are not as substantial as promised.\n\nLet the Bears put more skin in the game. The city gets a significant percentage of all net profits (with agreed upon accounting principals) until the bonds are paid off. The city profits if the Bears profit. We share the risk in getting those bonds paid off; we should be sharing the profits until the debt/bonds are paid off.\" -Irene R., the Loop", "source": {"uri": "blockclubchicago.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Block Club Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Staleys won the 1921 league championship. A year later, the team was renamed the Bears.\n\nThe Bears primarily have played home games at Wrigley Field and then Soldier Field, but a sprinkling of other venues also have hosted the team. Here's a look back at them -- and how the Bears have fared on those turfs.\n\nRecord: 221-89-22 (Two of the regular season victories came with the Bears as the \"road\" team against the Chicago Tigers)\n\nThe Bears played at Wrigley Field, previously known as Cubs Park, for their first five decades in Chicago. The team won nearly 70% of its home games during that span.\n\nWrigley Field is where University of Illinois star Harold \"Red\" Grange played his first game for the Bears on Nov. 26, 1925, in front of 36,000 fans. (The Bears and Cardinals fought to a scoreless tie, with Grange gaining 36 yards on the ground.) It's also where the Bears became the first team in the championship era (since 1933) to win back-to-back titles by routing the Giants 37-9 on Dec. 21, 1941. And where \"Kansas Comet\" Gale Sayers scored six touchdowns -- tying an NFL record -- as a rookie in a 61-20 win against the San Francisco 49ers on Dec. 12, 1965.\n\nIn 1921, the Bears, then known as the Staleys, won the American Professional Football Association title. And it wouldn't be their last. While at Wrigley, the Bears would win NFL titles in 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946 and 1963.\n\nThe team played its last game at Wrigley Field on Dec. 13, 1970. The NFL had been pressuring the Bears to move because seating capacity was less than 50,000 -- one of the parameters the league created after the AFL-NFL merger -- and because the stadium lacked lights. Jack Concannon had his best game in the finale as a Bear, throwing four touchdown passes and scoring a fifth, in a 35-17 win over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nThe Bears, known as the Staleys then, returned to their birthplace of Decatur to play the Rock Island Independents on Oct. 10, 1921.\n\n\"Six thousand former service men and visitors attending the American Legion convention,\" observed the game, the Tribune reported. The Bears won 14-10.\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nAs the home team, the Bears went undefeated at the Sheffield Avenue facility. They beat the Hammond Pros 28-7 on Oct. 11, 1925.\n\nMilton Romney, a University of Chicago graduate and first cousin once removed of Sen. Mitt Romney, started as a fullback opposite Notre Dame grad Johnny Mohardt.\n\nRecord: 0-0-1\n\n\"Ten thousand opening-day fans watched the elevens struggle up and down the dusty gridiron to a scoreless tie,\" the Tribune reported.\n\nThe Bears met the Brooklyn Dodgers at the West Side stadium on Sept. 21, 1930. Both teams managed to rack up 15 first downs, but no points. Bears fullback Bronko Nagurski recovered a fumble late in the game, but the Bears' final effort to score was halted at Brooklyn's goal line.\n\nGrange scored the Bears' first touchdown of the season \"when he crashed off Cleveland's left tackle on a delayed plunge,\" the Tribune reported.\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nSnow and freezing temperatures turned Wrigley into the North (Side) Pole and forced the Bears vs. Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans game for the NFL title indoors at Chicago Stadium to play on a 60-yard field before more than 11,000 fans. It was the first NFL game to be played indoors, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 1932, the Bears won 9-0 for their second title.\n\nThe 1932 NFL championship. Indoors at Chicago Stadium. How one of the strangest -- and most influential -- games in Bears history changed the league.\n\n\"Just the odor,\" she said with a laugh during a Tribune interview in March 2019. \"It was almost overwhelming because the circus had just left town.\"\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nThe Bears traveled 16 miles north to Evanston to take on the Philadelphia Eagles at Northwestern University's Dyche Stadium (now Ryan Field) on Sept. 27, 1970.\n\nDespite winning 20-16, reviews of the Bears' performance were brutal.\n\n\"The Bears committed almost every possible type of football sin. They were penalized for almost every foul in the book,\" Tribune sports editor Cooper Rollow wrote.\n\nEvanston didn't think much of the Bears either. Residents petitioned city officials to block the Bears from moving there. The Bears signed a five-year deal with Northwestern in early 1971, but the Big Ten Conference denied permission for the team to lease Dyche Stadium two weeks later.\n\nRecord: 234-176-2\n\nThe Bears relocated to Soldier Field -- where they had played on occasion previously, including as the \"away team\" against the Cardinals in 1926 -- for the start of the 1971 season. The team chose it over Comiskey Park. With the exception of one season in 2002 during stadium renovations, the downtown Chicago stadium on the lakefront has been their home ever since.\n\nThe new era began with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, 17-15 on Sept. 19, 1971, in the rain. Capacity was cut to 57,000 fans.\n\nChicago's Soldier Field: A timeline of events since 1924, including hosting the world's athletes, congregations, politicians and performers\n\nSoldier Field is where Walter Payton pummeled the Minnesota Vikings for 275 yards on Nov. 20, 1977, breaking O.J. Simpson's single-game NFL record of 273 yards on a 4-yard, fourth-down, fourth-quarter run that was stopped short of the first down. On Dec. 16, 1979 to news that George \"Mugs\" Halas, Jr., team president and son of the owner/founder, had died unexpectedly overnight, the Bears rallied to rout the St. Louis Cardinals 42-6 and earn a wild-card berth. Other memorable moments include a 61-7 win over the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 7, 1980 (though the Bears were eliminated from playoff contention after the Minnesota Vikings beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). And a 20-12 win over the Eagles in the 1988 NFC playoffs known as \"The Fog Bowl.\"\n\nA championship didn't come easily, or quickly, to Soldier Field's residents. It took 14 seasons for the Bears to bring a title home, winning Super Bowl XX in 1986 with a 46-10 rout of the New England Patriots. It was the team's ninth and most recent title. The Bears did earn a dramatic trip to Super Bowl XLI by defeating the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC championship game on Jan. 21, 2007, at Soldier Field -- and the George Halas Trophy was presented to Halas' daughter and team owner Virginia McCaskey.\n\nRecord: 3-5\n\nWhile Mayor Richard M. Daley and the Chicago Park District were busy remodeling Soldier Field, the Bears moved down to Champaign to play \"home\" games at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.\n\nNote: The Bears often played at Comiskey Park and Normal Park, but the Cardinals were the home team.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A key piece would be $900 million of public funds acquired through a sale of municipal bonds by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, a government agency set up in the 1980s.\n\nThe Bears are looking for that authorization to come through before the conclusion of the current legislative session at the end of May -- giving officials roughly five weeks to decide. Proponents don't want to wait months for lawmakers to reconvene in the fall because the winter weather could delay the project, said team president Kevin Warren.\n\n\"There is no environment for something like this today,\" Welch told reporters on Wednesday. He noted that while things could change, it's \"highly unlikely\" to pivot so drastically in the next month.\n\nThe ask comes at a tough time. Illinois is facing its tightest budget in three years that includes what Governor J.B. Pritzker has called \"hard choices.\" The state -- which carries the lowest credit rating among peers even after a string of upgrades -- is trying to pass a balanced spending plan while committing hundreds of millions to care for migrants and paying down its roughly $140 billion unfunded pension liability.\n\nMaintaining the state's improved fiscal trajectory is a priority that Welch, Pritzker and other state leaders underscore repeatedly. The memories of Illinois' credit grade teetering on the brink of junk near the start of the pandemic and a two-year budget impasse before that are still fresh.\n\n\"My hope is that the timing of this is not to give the legislature the bum's rush to hurry up in the next five weeks,\" said Joe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog. He said the fall session will give decision makers four to five months for an economic analysis.\n\nFerguson said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson standing alongside team officials supporting the proposal indicates the city is not an independent party and additional outside vetting of the financial plan is necessary. The overall pitch from the Bears is for a nearly $5 billion project that includes a revamped lakefront in addition to the stadium.\n\nDebt Plan\n\nThe Bears proposal would restructure past debt sold for Soldier Field, the Bears' current stadium, and Guaranteed Rate Field, home to Major League Baseball's White Sox, by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority and extend the maturity by 40 years, generating net new bond proceeds worth more than $1 billion, said Karen Murphy, executive vice president of stadium development for the Bears.\n\nThe debt would be backed by revenue from a 2% city hotel tax. If those funds fall short, the team plans to set up a reserve fund to cover the difference, according to Murphy.\n\nPreviously, when hotel tax revenue that the authority uses as a key source of funds has dipped -- like during fiscal 2022 and 2023 because of the pandemic -- the state is able to pull from income tax collections it sends to Chicago.\n\nFitch Ratings in December upgraded the authority two notches to BBB, taking it from junk to investment grade. The boost reflected \"the robust and sustained recovery in hotel tax revenues\" though the company warned though that a slump in stays or a \"significant unanticipated new money issuance\" may cause a downgrade.\n\n\"We'd have to see how that plays out,\" said Fitch analyst Eric Kim, noting that few details are available on the structure of the potential financing. \"We are certainly watching in terms of what is the state going to be taking on as part of this project.\"\n\nSign up for Bloomberg's Business of Sports newsletter for the context you need on the collision of power, money and sports.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Municipal bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Will NFL Draft Day be as dramatic as Wednesday's Bears news?\n\nThe Chicago Bears rolled out their bold vision for a contemporary new stadium and reimagined lakefront Wednesday. Take a look here.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson enthusiastically supports the project, saying major selling points are job creation and a promise that there are \"no new taxes on the residents of Chicago.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean there won't be a cost. Here are the numbers:\n\nThe bill for the project could be $4.6 billion, which includes stadium and hotel costs of $3.2 billion and $1.4 billion for infrastructure work.\n\nWho pays: the Bears are pledging more than $2 billion, a commitment larger, they say, than any public-private project in the country.\n\nWho pays the rest: The Chicago hotel tax that goes into the Illinois Sports Facility Authority would fund the rest. The ISFA currently pays debts related to the current Bears and White Sox stadiums. The Bears are now saying they want to extend those debt payments to build the current stadium.\n\nThe Bears say the ISFA bonds, which also go to the White Sox, will generate $900 million. The numbers don't include what the Sox may also need to build their proposed stadium at The 78.\n\nAnd there's this: The Bears need an additional $300 million for infrastructure work that the Illinois General Assembly and governor would have to approve -- and it doesn't look like they're interested.\n\nThe reax: Gov. JB Pritzker and Illinois Senate President Don Harmon both said they are skeptical of the project.\n\nIllinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch left open a tiny window of opportunity. \"The speaker is happy to continue engaging in conversations regarding the future of our Chicago teams and is encouraged by the private investments being proposed,\" a spokeswoman said. \"Environments can and do change in Springfield, but the speaker's priority is to stay focused on passing a balanced budget and continue the positive outlook we saw announced by Moody's yesterday.\"\n\nDeja vu all over again: Friends of the Parks, the environmental group that put the brakes on filmmaker George Lucas' museum plan in the same location, criticized the Bears effort, calling it \"the 'Chicago Way.\" In a statement, the group said, \"Once again, Chicago taxpayers are being told what's good for them.\"\n\nOther state lawmaker reactions are mixed: Reps. Kelly Burke and Marcus Evans Jr. are supporting the plan and were listed among other backers. Other supporters took to social media to point to Minnesota now owning its stadium\" free and clear,\" via X.\n\nState Rep. Kam Buckner, the House assistant majority leader, attended Wednesday's presentation.

Former Clinton Police Chief Michael Reidy remembered as mentor and friend Road closures planned for 'Big Lebowski' event in Normal Bloomington man detained on child solicitation charge Illinois State tight end Cam Grandy, a Fieldcrest grad, hopeful for NFL Draft selection Illinois State basketball adds former Northern Iowa guard\n\nFinally, announcing the plan the day before the Bears are expected to select quarterback Caleb Williams with the first pick in the NFL draft was a marketing coup, a much better idea than announcing it the day after another loss to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nEverything seemed to be fine, and if the Bears get their wish, a new stadium would be ready in time for the 2028 season, when Williams should be gunning for his second Super Bowl.\n\nAfter seeing the renderings and listening to Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren talk about the Super Bowls, Final Fours, Illinois high school football championships and concerts that would take place in the new stadium, how could anyone dare say no to this idea?\n\n\"If that doesn't make your teeth chatter, I don't know what will,\" Warren said after the release of the renderings.\n\nObviously Warren never has sat in the stands at a Bears game in subzero weather or he would know the only thing in Chicago that would make one's teeth chatter is watching a bad team while freezing your butt off. I have, and I can't say it's comparable to seeing the renderings.\n\nBut they did look kind of cool, just as the renderings for the proposed White Sox Park in the South Loop looked terrific. I'm guessing the renderings of the new Comiskey Park and the Soldier Field renovation also looked cool when they were revealed, because anything new and futuristic looking is bound to appear better than the status quo.\n\nMaybe there will even be more bathrooms, and video boards that you won't have to crane your neck to see?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nNaturally, Gov. J.B. Pritzker immediately threw cold water on the Bears' and Johnson's big day, saying he was \"skeptical\" and wondering \"whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers.\" That's the easiest way to put the kibosh on the project without actually looking into whether it would be a good thing for the city and the McCaskeys, the public and private part of the public-private venture.\n\nFunding should not be an issue. Warren told the Tribune editorial board that the 30-year bonds for U.S. Bank Stadium, which he got built in Minnesota, were paid off 23 years ahead of schedule because of revenues from e-pull tabs, a gambling game that's like a lottery ticket.\n\nIf extending the 2% hotel tax for another 40 years is a problem for Pritzker, perhaps the Bears can instead propose an added 2% tax on adult-use cannabis sales in Illinois. That should pay off the bonds for the new stadium in no time, as anyone who ever got a contact high from strolling through the tailgate parties on the Waldron Deck, the proposed site of the stadium, can attest.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Park likely will try to butt in, as they did when they drove away the last billionaire who wanted to build something -- a \"Star Wars\" themed museum -- on our cherished lakefront.\n\nBut this is not an ego-driven project promoting an overrated sci-fi movie that appeals only to nerds. This is our beloved Bears, even though they're owned by the not-so-beloved McCaskeys. Who elected these \"Friends\" anyways? Can't they find something to do inside for once in their lives?\n\nTime is of the essence, the Bears warned us, with the cost expected to go up by $150 million or so every wasted year without a shovel in the ground.\n\nIf you can't bear the idea of helping out the billionaire McCaskeys, do it for all the kids who would benefit from what was touted as 20% more open space from the removal of the crashed spaceship and turning the current field into a park -- albeit with better sod, I'm guessing.\n\nOr think about Johnson's inauguration ceremony at the new stadium, as he bizarrely fantasized about Wednesday during his rambling pep-rally speech that ended with the words \"God bless the greatest freaking city in the world.\"\n\nThat's our mayor, an orator for the ages.\n\nOr think about poor Beyonce not having to worry about performing in the rain, as almost happened last summer, we were informed at the presentation. Not only would the new translucent roof protect fans from dreaded \"Bear weather,\" it would keep pop stars such as Beyonce and Swift warm and dry.\n\nThere are so many reasons to get this done it boggles the mind, and the sooner the better before the White Sox ask for their handout.\n\nThe No. 1 reason, of course, is the possibility of a getting Super Bowl down the road.\n\n\"How many people would love to come to a Super Bowl in Chicago?\" Johnson asked, before answering his own question:\n\n\"Everyone.\"\n\nA week in Chicago in February over Phoenix or Miami? It's a no-brainer.\n\nThere were plenty of unanswered questions about financing, parking, tailgating, PSLs and whether anyone will be able to find the Uber lot after a game. The 1.4-mile walk from the Roosevelt Road \"L\" station would still be a half-hour to the Waldron Deck site, but maybe they'll have room in the infrastructure budget for a people mover.\n\nAnyway, Bears, you had me at \"Fear the roar.\"\n\nSo bye-bye, spaceship, and so long, Bear weather.\n\nAs Burnham said: Make no little plans when you can have a translucent roof instead.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0

I have, and I can't say it's comparable to seeing the renderings.\n\nChicago Bears release images of a proposed new lakefront stadium\n\nBut they did look kind of cool, just as the renderings for the proposed White Sox Park in the South Loop looked terrific. I'm guessing the renderings of the new Comiskey Park and the Soldier Field renovation also looked cool when they were revealed, because anything new and futuristic looking is bound to appear better than the status quo.\n\nMaybe there will even be more bathrooms, and video boards that you won't have to crane your neck to see?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nNaturally, Gov. J.B. Pritzker immediately threw cold water on the Bears' and Johnson's big day, saying he was \"skeptical\" and wondering \"whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers.\" That's the easiest way to put the kibosh on the project without actually looking into whether it would be a good thing for the city and the McCaskeys, the public and private part of the public-private venture.\n\nFunding should not be an issue. Warren told the Tribune editorial board that the 30-year bonds for U.S. Bank Stadium, which he got built in Minnesota, were paid off 23 years ahead of schedule because of revenues from e-pull tabs, a gambling game that's like a lottery ticket.\n\nIf extending the 2% hotel tax for another 40 years is a problem for Pritzker, perhaps the Bears can instead propose an added 2% tax on adult-use cannabis sales in Illinois. That should pay off the bonds for the new stadium in no time, as anyone who ever got a contact high from strolling through the tailgate parties on the Waldron Deck, the proposed site of the stadium, can attest.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Park likely will try to butt in, as they did when they drove away the last billionaire who wanted to build something -- a \"Star Wars\" themed museum -- on our cherished lakefront.\n\nBut this is not an ego-driven project promoting an overrated sci-fi movie that appeals only to nerds. This is our beloved Bears, even though they're owned by the not-so-beloved McCaskeys. Who elected these \"Friends\" anyways? Can't they find something to do inside for once in their lives?\n\nTime is of the essence, the Bears warned us, with the cost expected to go up by $150 million or so every wasted year without a shovel in the ground.\n\nIf you can't bear the idea of helping out the billionaire McCaskeys, do it for all the kids who would benefit from what was touted as 20% more open space from the removal of the crashed spaceship and turning the current field into a park -- albeit with better sod, I'm guessing.\n\nOr think about Johnson's inauguration ceremony at the new stadium, as he bizarrely fantasized about Wednesday during his rambling pep-rally speech that ended with the words \"God bless the greatest freaking city in the world.\"\n\nThat's our mayor, an orator for the ages.\n\nOr think about poor Beyonce not having to worry about performing in the rain, as almost happened last summer, we were informed at the presentation. Not only would the new translucent roof protect fans from dreaded \"Bear weather,\" it would keep pop stars such as Beyonce and Swift warm and dry.\n\nThere are so many reasons to get this done it boggles the mind, and the sooner the better before the White Sox ask for their handout.\n\nThe No. 1 reason, of course, is the possibility of a getting Super Bowl down the road.\n\n\"How many people would love to come to a Super Bowl in Chicago?\" Johnson asked, before answering his own question:\n\n\"Everyone.\"\n\nA week in Chicago in February over Phoenix or Miami? It's a no-brainer.\n\nThere were plenty of unanswered questions about financing, parking, tailgating, PSLs and whether anyone will be able to find the Uber lot after a game. The 1.4-mile walk from the Roosevelt Road \"L\" station would still be a half-hour to the Waldron Deck site, but maybe they'll have room in the infrastructure budget for a people mover.\n\nAs Burnham said: Make no little plans when you can have a translucent roof instead.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_sullivan@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Paul Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Burnham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comiskey_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comiskey Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

However, the statement continued: \"In the current legislative environment, with many important budget pressures, there hasn't been a strong appetite for these projects. Environments can and do often change in Springfield, but the speaker's priority is to stay focused on passing a balanced budget and continuing the (state's) positive (fiscal) outlook.\"\n\nIn announcing their plan, the Bears argued that some federal funds may be available to pay part of the infrastructure costs for roads and the like, and emphasized that no news taxes would be levied for the stadium proper, merely continuing an existing 2% tax on Chicago hotel rooms for another 40 years.\n\nBut the governor didn't sound convinced.\n\n\"I remain skeptical\" about using taxpayer funds to build stadiums for professional teams, Pritzker said at press conference far from Soldier Field, noting that voters in Kansas City just rejected a tax hike for a new stadium for their Super Bowl champ Chiefs. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for the state.\"\n\nPritzker upgraded that to \"highly skeptical\" in later comments. Insiders said a populist Democratic governor with national ambitions might relish the chance to kill big subsidies for a private entity owned by the wealthy McCaskey family.\n\nStill, even populist Democratic governors listen and listen hard to organized labor. Indeed, unions, particularly the politically powerful building trades unions, are most interested in the projected 43,000 construction jobs the Bears say the stadium project would create.\n\nBeyond that, Speaker Welch is right that mountains can move on short notice in Springfield when the powers that be so desire. That's exactly what happened in 1988 when a last-second deal for a new stadium was struck to keep the White Sox from moving to Florida.\n\nThat was then, though. The Sox deal passed because a governor then at the height of his power, Jim Thompson, personally championed the cause along with a speaker who could do about anything, Mike Madigan. Today, the governor is against the plan, Welch is less inclined than his predecessor to muscle votes and the stadium's biggest political booster a Chicago mayor with an approval rating in the latest polls hovering in the mid-20s.\n\nAnother obstacle: Jerry Reinsdorf and the Chicago White Sox. The Bears' proposed deal totally uses up the hotel-tax revenue that Reinsdorf wants to tap to build a new stadium for his team in the South Loop. The Bears already have enough problems without swatting away squads of high-powered lobbyists working for Reinsdorf.\n\nBest guess now: The Bears have put a plan on the table, and now there will be negotiation. Perhaps over instead using the Michael Reese site just to the south of Soldier Field. Perhaps over cutting the price or getting the McCaskeys to put more money on the table. Or perhaps working out something with Reinsdorf and the Chicago Red Stars, who also are seeking a new home.\n\nAll of that is going to take some time, even with the Bears' PR machine in high gear. That suggests nothing much will happen until after the November elections.\n\nAs Friends of the Parks put it in a statement released yesterday evening, \"As is so often the case in Chicago, the powerful and wealthy are demanding that our entire city stop and fast-track their plans to expand operations on the people's lakefront. . . .This is a time for some thoughtful, deliberate and civic engagement.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagobusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's Chicago Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Chris_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emanuel Chris Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Harmon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Don Harmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Reinsdorf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Reinsdorf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_R._Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James R.

Taxpayers are expected to contribute $900 million upfront through bonds issued by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. In addition, the team is eyeing another $1.5 billion in public infrastructure funds, a move that has drawn support and skepticism.\n\nKey components of the plan include immediate infrastructure needs totaling $325 million for the stadium's opening, followed by subsequent phases featuring enhancements like new parking and multi-use playfields, as well as transportation improvements to boost accessibility to the nearby Museum Campus.\n\nThe proposed stadium itself boasts a striking design, featuring a translucent fixed roof with a transparent opening on the north side, offering views of the city skyline. Soldier Field, meanwhile, would undergo significant transformation, leaving room for 14 acres of multi-use sports fields amid its historic colonnades.\n\nDespite concerns over the allocation of public funds, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has thrown his weight behind the initiative, assuring citizens that it won't entail new or increased taxes. However, plans to extend an existing 2 percent tax on hotel stays for another 40 years have stirred debate over the project's long-term financial implications.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker, while expressing reservations, emphasized the need for prudent fiscal stewardship, citing recent public rejections of stadium subsidies elsewhere. The Bears, however, are keen on swift legislative approval, aiming to secure backing during the spring session.\n\nState Senate President Don Harmon echoed the governor's cautious stance, highlighting the substantial funding gap that remains despite the significant private investment. Meanwhile, Illinois House Speaker Chris Welch stressed the need for a balanced budget amid competing fiscal pressures.\n\nThe Bears' financing strategy involves a complex mix of private funds, including loans from the NFL and anticipated revenue from marketing rights and personal seat licenses.

Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat they're saying\n\nThe Bears said in the statement that their \"goal of building the largest single development project in Illinois history led by billions of dollars in private capital investment, and the jobs and economic benefits generated, is at risk in Arlington Heights.\"\n\nThe team continued: \"The stadium-based project remains broadly popular in Arlington Heights, Chicagoland and the state. However, the property's original assessment at five times the 2021 tax value, and the recent settlement with Churchill Downs for 2022 being three times higher, fails to reflect the property is not operational and not commercially viable in its current state.\n\n\"We will continue the ongoing demolition activity and work toward a path forward in Arlington Heights, but it is no longer our singular focus. It is our responsibility to listen to other municipalities in Chicagoland about potential locations that can deliver on this transformational opportunity for our fans, our club and the State of Illinois.\"\n\nBackstory\n\nIn September 2021, the Bears signed a purchase agreement for the Arlington International Racecourse property in suburban Arlington Heights. The 326-acre property was bought for $197.2 million.\n\nThe Bears moved from Wrigley Field to Soldier Field in 1971 to meet the NFL's requirements for seating capacity. Now, Soldier Field has the smallest capacity in the league (61,500).\n\nGiven that the Bears own the Arlington Park racetrack property and have already started demolishing it, this Friday news dump smells like posturing if not just B.S.\n\nBut on the other hand, it's not like public officials in the village of Arlington Heights -- not to mention the other governmental bodies involved -- have backed up a truck full of cash and promises at Halas Hall.\n\nIn today's more educated media ecosystem, anyone with a lick of sense knows that the economic promises that come with new sports stadiums are loaded with more false promises than a 12-year-old trying to beg his parents for a PS5. With that in mind, there is a lot to work through in terms of tax and infrastructure issues to get a multi-billion stadium and \"entertainment district\" built in Illinois.\n\nThe Bears hired Warren from the Big Ten to lead their stadium search and this is probably a good sign that he's working on it.\n\nThis story reminds me a bit of 2013, when the Cubs were linked to the village of Rosemont as they were fighting with the owners of the nearby rooftop clubs and also trying to squeeze the city for help in renovating Wrigley Field. Rosemont, for the uninformed, is a small village near O'Hare Airport with hotels, convention centers and plenty of entertainment and dining options. But it was simply a leverage play.\n\nWhile Wrigley Field has the perfect location for an urban ballpark and is a money-printing machine, making a move highly unlikely, the city-owned Soldier Field is basically the opposite situation for the Bears, which is why they're focused on moving to the suburbs, where they can spread out in a modern oasis of football and commerce.\n\nNaperville, honestly, isn't a bad option. It's the fourth-biggest city, in terms of population, in Illinois and while I still have nightmares about driving there to cover Chicago Fire games in 2003 when they played at North Central College. It's no worse than Arlington Heights for a lot of Bears fans.\n\nIn any event, the Chicago Bears want to move out of Chicago and they want a lot of help to do so. So this isn't over. If you're a suburban mayor looking to get your name in The Athletic, feel free to shoot me a news release. -- Greenberg\n\nRequired reading", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news",

I have, and I can't say it's comparable to seeing the renderings.\n\nBut they did look kind of cool, just as the renderings for the proposed White Sox Park in the South Loop looked terrific. I'm guessing the renderings of the new Comiskey Park and the Soldier Field renovation also looked cool when they were revealed, because anything new and futuristic looking is bound to appear better than the status quo.\n\nMaybe there will even be more bathrooms, and video boards that you won't have to crane your neck to see?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nNaturally, Gov. J.B. Pritzker immediately threw cold water on the Bears' and Johnson's big day, saying he was \"skeptical\" and wondering \"whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers.\" That's the easiest way to put the kibosh on the project without actually looking into whether it would be a good thing for the city and the McCaskeys, the public and private part of the public-private venture.\n\nFunding should not be an issue. Warren told the Chicago Tribune editorial board that the 30-year bonds for U.S. Bank Stadium, which he got built in Minnesota, were paid off 23 years ahead of schedule because of revenues from e-pull tabs, a gambling game that's like a lottery ticket.\n\nIf extending the 2% hotel tax for another 40 years is a problem for Pritzker, perhaps the Bears can instead propose an added 2% tax on adult-use cannabis sales in Illinois. That should pay off the bonds for the new stadium in no time, as anyone who ever got a contact high from strolling through the tailgate parties on the Waldron Deck, the proposed site of the stadium, can attest.\n\nThe nonprofit Friends of the Park likely will try to butt in, as they did when they drove away the last billionaire who wanted to build something - a \"Star Wars\" themed museum - on our cherished lakefront.\n\nBut this is not an ego-driven project promoting an overrated sci-fi movie that appeals only to nerds. This is our beloved Bears, even though they're owned by the not-so-beloved McCaskeys. Who elected these \"Friends\" anyways? Can't they find something to do inside for once in their lives?\n\nTime is of the essence, the Bears warned us, with the cost expected to go up by $150 million or so every wasted year without a shovel in the ground.\n\nIf you can't bear the idea of helping out the billionaire McCaskeys, do it for all the kids who would benefit from what was touted as 20% more open space from the removal of the crashed spaceship and turning the current field into a park - albeit with better sod, I'm guessing.\n\nOr think about Johnson's inauguration ceremony at the new stadium, as he bizarrely fantasized about Wednesday during his rambling pep-rally speech that ended with the words \"God bless the greatest freaking city in the world.\"\n\nThat's our mayor, an orator for the ages.\n\nOr think about poor Beyonce not having to worry about performing in the rain, as almost happened last summer, we were informed at the presentation. Not only would the new translucent roof protect fans from dreaded \"Bear weather,\" it would keep pop stars such as Beyonce and Swift warm and dry.\n\nThere are so many reasons to get this done it boggles the mind, and the sooner the better before the White Sox ask for their handout.\n\nThe No. 1 reason, of course, is the possibility of a getting Super Bowl down the road.\n\n\"How many people would love to come to a Super Bowl in Chicago?\" Johnson asked, before answering his own question:\n\n\"Everyone.\"\n\nA week in Chicago in February over Phoenix or Miami? It's a no-brainer.\n\nThere were plenty of unanswered questions about financing, parking, tailgating, PSLs and whether anyone will be able to find the Uber lot after a game. The 1.4-mile walk from the Roosevelt Road \"L\" station would still be a half-hour to the Waldron Deck site, but maybe they'll have room in the infrastructure budget for a people mover.\n\nAs Burnham said: Make no little plans when you can have a translucent roof instead.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_sullivan@bradenton.com", "name": "Paul Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comiskey_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comiskey Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name-dropping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Name-dropping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beyonc\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The Staleys won the 1921 league championship. A year later, the team was renamed the Bears.\n\nThe Bears primarily have played home games at Wrigley Field and then Soldier Field, but a sprinkling of other venues also have hosted the team. Here's a look back at them -- and how the Bears have fared on those turfs.\n\nWrigley Field (1921-1970)\n\nRecord: 221-89-22 (Two of the regular season victories came with the Bears as the \"road\" team against the Chicago Tigers)\n\nThe Bears played at Wrigley Field, previously known as Cubs Park, for their first five decades in Chicago. The team won nearly 70% of its home games during that span.\n\nPeople are also reading...

(Finnigan) Jackson Former Clinton Police Chief Michael Reidy remembered as mentor and friend Woman indicted on theft charges in McLean County Bloomington man detained on child solicitation charge Illinois State tight end Cam Grandy, a Fieldcrest grad, hopeful for NFL Draft selection Illinois State basketball adds former Northern Iowa guard\n\nWrigley Field is where University of Illinois star Harold \"Red\" Grange played his first game for the Bears on Nov. 26, 1925, in front of 36,000 fans. (The Bears and Cardinals fought to a scoreless tie, with Grange gaining 36 yards on the ground.) It's also where the Bears became the first team in the championship era (since 1933) to win back-to-back titles by routing the Giants 37-9 on Dec. 21, 1941. And where \"Kansas Comet\" Gale Sayers scored six touchdowns -- tying an NFL record -- as a rookie in a 61-20 win against the San Francisco 49ers on Dec. 12, 1965.\n\nIn 1921, the Bears, then known as the Staleys, won the American Professional Football Association title. And it wouldn't be their last. While at Wrigley, the Bears would win NFL titles in 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946 and 1963.\n\nThe team played its last game at Wrigley Field on Dec. 13, 1970. The NFL had been pressuring the Bears to move because seating capacity was less than 50,000 -- one of the parameters the league created after the AFL-NFL merger -- and because the stadium lacked lights. Jack Concannon had his best game in the finale as a Bear, throwing four touchdown passes and scoring a fifth, in a 35-17 win over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nStaley Field (1921)\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nThe Bears, known as the Staleys then, returned to their birthplace of Decatur to play the Rock Island Independents on Oct. 10, 1921.\n\n\"Six thousand former service men and visitors attending the American Legion convention,\" observed the game, the Tribune reported. The Bears won 14-10.\n\nDePaul Field (1925)\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nAs the home team, the Bears went undefeated at the Sheffield Avenue facility. They beat the Hammond Pros 28-7 on Oct. 11, 1925.\n\nMilton Romney, a University of Chicago graduate and first cousin once removed of Sen. Mitt Romney, started as a fullback opposite Notre Dame grad Johnny Mohardt.\n\nMills Stadium (1930)\n\nRecord: 0-0-1\n\n\"Ten thousand opening-day fans watched the elevens struggle up and down the dusty gridiron to a scoreless tie,\" the Tribune reported.\n\nThe Bears met the Brooklyn Dodgers at the West Side stadium on Sept. 21, 1930. Both teams managed to rack up 15 first downs, but no points. Bears fullback Bronko Nagurski recovered a fumble late in the game, but the Bears' final effort to score was halted at Brooklyn's goal line.\n\nLoyola Stadium (1931)\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nThe Bears beat the Cleveland Indians 21-0 on Sept. 18, 1931.\n\nGrange scored the Bears' first touchdown of the season \"when he crashed off Cleveland's left tackle on a delayed plunge,\" the Tribune reported.\n\nChicago Stadium (1932)\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nSnow and freezing temperatures turned Wrigley into the North (Side) Pole and forced the Bears vs. Portsmouth (Ohio) Spartans game for the NFL title indoors at Chicago Stadium to play on a 60-yard field before more than 11,000 fans. It was the first NFL game to be played indoors, according to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 1932, the Bears won 9-0 for their second title.\n\nThe 1932 NFL championship. Indoors at Chicago Stadium. How one of the strangest -- and most influential -- games in Bears history changed the league.\n\nBears owner Virginia Halas McCaskey was a seventh grader at the time and had a lasting memory of the game.\n\n\"Just the odor,\" she said with a laugh during a Tribune interview in March 2019. \"It was almost overwhelming because the circus had just left town.\"\n\nDyche Stadium (1970)\n\nRecord: 1-0\n\nThe Bears traveled 16 miles north to Evanston to take on the Philadelphia Eagles at Northwestern University's Dyche Stadium (now Ryan Field) on Sept. 27, 1970.\n\nDespite winning 20-16, reviews of the Bears' performance were brutal.\n\n\"The Bears committed almost every possible type of football sin. They were penalized for almost every foul in the book,\" Tribune sports editor Cooper Rollow wrote.\n\nEvanston didn't think much of the Bears either. Residents petitioned city officials to block the Bears from moving there. The Bears signed a five-year deal with Northwestern in early 1971, but the Big Ten Conference denied permission for the team to lease Dyche Stadium two weeks later.\n\nSoldier Field (1971-2001; 2003-present)\n\nRecord: 234-176-2\n\nThe Bears relocated to Soldier Field -- where they had played on occasion previously, including as the \"away team\" against the Cardinals in 1926 -- for the start of the 1971 season. The team chose it over Comiskey Park. With the exception of one season in 2002 during stadium renovations, the downtown Chicago stadium on the lakefront has been their home ever since.\n\nThe new era began with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, 17-15 on Sept. 19, 1971, in the rain. Capacity was cut to 57,000 fans.\n\nChicago's Soldier Field: A timeline of events since 1924, including hosting the world's athletes, congregations, politicians and performers\n\nSoldier Field is where Walter Payton pummeled the Minnesota Vikings for 275 yards on Nov. 20, 1977, breaking O.J. Simpson's single-game NFL record of 273 yards on a 4-yard, fourth-down, fourth-quarter run that was stopped short of the first down. On Dec. 16, 1979 to news that George \"Mugs\" Halas, Jr., team president and son of the owner/founder, had died unexpectedly overnight, the Bears rallied to rout the St. Louis Cardinals 42-6 and earn a wild-card berth. Other memorable moments include a 61-7 win over the Green Bay Packers on Dec. 7, 1980 (though the Bears were eliminated from playoff contention after the Minnesota Vikings beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). And a 20-12 win over the Eagles in the 1988 NFC playoffs known as \"The Fog Bowl.\"\n\nA championship didn't come easily, or quickly, to Soldier Field's residents. It took 14 seasons for the Bears to bring a title home, winning Super Bowl XX in 1986 with a 46-10 rout of the New England Patriots. It was the team's ninth and most recent title. The Bears did earn a dramatic trip to Super Bowl XLI by defeating the New Orleans Saints 39-14 in the NFC championship game on Jan. 21, 2007, at Soldier Field -- and the George Halas Trophy was presented to Halas' daughter and team owner Virginia McCaskey.\n\nMemorial Stadium (2002)\n\nRecord: 3-5\n\nWhile Mayor Richard M. Daley and the Chicago Park District were busy remodeling Soldier Field, the Bears moved down to Champaign to play \"home\" games at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.\n\nNote: The Bears often played at Comiskey Park and Normal Park, but the Cardinals were the home team.\n\nSources: Tribune archives and reporting; Pro Football Hall of Fame; Pro Football Reference\n\nSubscribe to the

A key piece would be $900 million of public funds acquired through a sale of municipal bonds by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, a government agency set up in the 1980s.\n\nThe Bears are looking for that authorization to come through before the conclusion of the current legislative session at the end of May -- giving officials roughly five weeks to decide. Proponents don't want to wait months for lawmakers to reconvene in the fall because the winter weather could delay the project, said team president Kevin Warren.\n\n\"There is no environment for something like this today,\" Welch told reporters on Wednesday. He noted that while things could change, it's \"highly unlikely\" to pivot so drastically in the next month.\n\nThe ask comes at a tough time. Illinois is facing its tightest budget in three years that includes what Governor J.B. Pritzker has called \"hard choices.\" The state -- which carries the lowest credit rating among peers even after a string of upgrades -- is trying to pass a balanced spending plan while committing hundreds of millions to care for migrants and paying down its roughly $140 billion unfunded pension liability.\n\nMaintaining the state's improved fiscal trajectory is a priority that Welch, Pritzker and other state leaders underscore repeatedly. The memories of Illinois' credit grade teetering on the brink of junk near the start of the pandemic and a two-year budget impasse before that are still fresh.\n\n\"My hope is that the timing of this is not to give the legislature the bum's rush to hurry up in the next five weeks,\" said Joe Ferguson, president of the Civic Federation, a fiscal watchdog. He said the fall session will give decision makers four to five months for an economic analysis.\n\nFerguson said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson standing alongside team officials supporting the proposal indicates the city is not an independent party and additional outside vetting of the financial plan is necessary. The overall pitch from the Bears is for a nearly $5 billion project that includes a revamped lakefront in addition to the stadium.\n\nDebt Plan\n\nThe Bears proposal would restructure past debt sold for Soldier Field, the Bears' current stadium, and Guaranteed Rate Field, home to Major League Baseball's White Sox, by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority and extend the maturity by 40 years, generating net new bond proceeds worth more than $1 billion, said Karen Murphy, executive vice president of stadium development for the Bears.\n\nThe debt would be backed by revenue from a 2% city hotel tax. If those funds fall short, the team plans to set up a reserve fund to cover the difference, according to Murphy.\n\nPreviously, when hotel tax revenue that the authority uses as a key source of funds has dipped -- like during fiscal 2022 and 2023 because of the pandemic -- the state is able to pull from income tax collections it sends to Chicago.\n\nFitch Ratings in December upgraded the authority two notches to BBB, taking it from junk to investment grade. The boost reflected \"the robust and sustained recovery in hotel tax revenues\" though the company warned though that a slump in stays or a \"significant unanticipated new money issuance\" may cause a downgrade.\n\n\"We'd have to see how that plays out,\" said Fitch analyst Eric Kim, noting that few details are available on the structure of the potential financing. \"We are certainly watching in terms of what is the state going to be taking on as part of this project.\"\n\nSign up for Bloomberg's Business of Sports newsletter for the context you need on the collision of power, money and sports.\n\nUnlock a world of Benefits!

It's a privately owned, state-of-the-art indoor/outdoor sports and entertainment complex that cost between $5 billion and $6 billion to build, but not one dime of taxpayers' money was used.\n\nOn the other hand, Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium is owned by the public and taxpayers footed 40% of the bill to build it.\n\nThat public-private partnership, with taxpayers kicking in on the cost, is the most typical arrangement, experts say, and a combination of public and private funding is what the Chicago Bears are requesting in their pitch to replace Soldier Field with a modern domed stadium on the city's lakefront.\n\n\"There are significant benefits to building a dome stadium in a city like Chicago,\" said Marc Ganis, Sportscorp LTD. \"It will attract not just a Super Bowl every decade or so but on an ongoing basis it will be the attraction for major events.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Bears to unveil plans for a new lakefront stadium\n\nGanis, a sports marketing expert, said the city can generate revenue because it has one of the highest hotel taxes in the country, but sports economists say stadiums are wrongly but successfully sod to taxpayers as investments.\n\nAccording to the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, since 2020 taxpayers have paid about $750 million toward construction costs of eight new stadiums or arenas across the four major sports leagues.\n\n\"That is usually the selling point, we can have development we can have whatsoever. The evidence is overwhelming: these make very poor investments,\" said Allen Sanderson, University of Chicago economics professor.\n\nRELATED: Former Gov. Patt Quinn proposes referendum on use of taxpayer money to fund Chicago sports stadiums\n\nSanderson said cities rarely get a return on their investments, especially with football stadiums because there are so few games a year and ticket holders tend to be local.\n\n\"The Chicago Marathon probably generates more revenue than most these facilities because two-thirds of the runners are not from Chicago,\" he said.\n\nSanderson doubts there will be enough special events and ticket sales year round at a new domed stadium to generate enough revenue for the city.\n\nThe announcement from the Bears at 12 p.m. Wednesday will be held at Soldier Field.

But the team switched focus back to Chicago this year after property tax negotiations with local school districts broke down.\n\nSeveral other communities, including Naperville and Aurora, also expressed interest in luring the Bears.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson's office declined to comment Monday, but he has recently spoken about having promising conversations with Warren and hinted at unspecified benefits that Chicago would reap from the team's continued presence downtown.\n\nDuring an unrelated news conference last Wednesday, the mayor again said \"ownership has to put some skin in the game\" when asked about the ongoing jockeying for new stadiums by the Bears as well as other Chicago sports teams such as the White Sox. He also maintained there would be no new taxes to help out the franchises.\n\n\"If we're going to build 21st century stadiums, we have to make sure that that investment is activating the entire city of Chicago, and these conversations particularly with the Bears have been quite positive,\" Johnson said. \"I appreciate the leadership of Kevin Warren. ... But no, we have not made any commitments to any new forms of revenue.\"\n\nThe last part of his statement was in response to a question about a rejected proposal from the White Sox, first reported by Crain's Chicago Business, to use part of the amusement tax to fund new stadiums for the Bears and White Sox, to which Johnson on Wednesday said, \"We didn't like the idea, it was that simple.\"\n\nGov.

The funding from the ISFA would involve extending bonds of the existing 2% hotel tax.\n\nThe Bears said the project would generate $8 billion in economic impact for the region. It would be built in three phases and take up to five years. The new stadium would be constructed on a parking lot just south of Soldier Field, the Bears' home since 1971. The team's lease at the 100-year-old stadium runs through 2033.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson gave a full-throated endorsement, saying the project is in line with Daniel Burnham's \"Plan of Chicago.\" He said there would be no tax hikes or new taxes for Chicago residents.\n\nRenderings show the Bears' stadium would have a translucent roof and massive glass panels that would bring in sunlight and allow for views of Chicago's famed skyline. The plan is to host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\n\nThough Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the spaceship-like stadium that was installed in the renovation two decades ago would be torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space. The plan calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza.\n\n\"My administration insisted that any new project -- especially one on public land -- must deliver strong public benefit and public use for the City of Chicago, and I am pleased today that this plan does exactly that,\" Johnson said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, however, said he wasn't on board.\n\n\"I remain skeptical about this proposal and I wonder whether it's a good deal for the taxpayers,\" Pritzker told reporters Wednesday at an unrelated news conference. \"I'm not sure this is among the highest priorities for taxpayers.\"\n\nIllinois' top legislative leaders were also doubtful.\n\n\"If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail and it would fail miserably,\" Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch said at an unrelated news conference. \"There is no environment for something like this today.\"\n\nHowever, he added that the environment in Springfield does change.\n\nThe proposal comes as two other Chicago sports teams, including the White Sox and Red Stars, have expressed interest in public funding for new stadiums.\n\nWarren, who replaced the retired Ted Phillips a year ago, played a big role in the construction of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis through a public-private partnership when he worked in the Minnesota Vikings' front office from 2005 to 2019.\n\nThe Bears spent $197.2 million more than a year ago to purchase the site of the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse from Churchill Downs Inc. They envisioned building a stadium on the 326-acre tract of land some 30 miles northwest of Soldier Field, with restaurants, retail and more on the property -- all for about $5 billion, with some taxpayer help.\n\nThe Bears had said they would pay for the stadium in Arlington Heights, with taxpayer dollars covering infrastructure costs such as roads and sewers. Those plans stalled, with the team citing a property assessment it said was too high.\n\nThey would remain tenants by staying in Chicago rather than owning a stadium in Arlington Heights. But Warren said he sees it as more of a partnership with the city rather than a landlord-tenant relationship.\n\n\"I believe in Mayor Johnson,\" Warren said. \"I believe in his staff, his vision, I believe in this city. I don't look at it as being a renter. I look at it as being able to develop a relationship, to be able to come together. People asked that same question in Minnesota -- why would you want to be a renter?\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Sophia Tareen in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\nHistory photos: Chicago's Soldier Field through the years Soldier Field - 2003 Soldier Field - 1971 Soldier Field - 1931 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1987 Soldier Field - 1926 Soldier Field - 1933 Soldier Field - 1928 Soldier Field - 1939 Soldier Field - 1962 Soldier Field - 1946 Soldier Field - 1978 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1943 Soldier Field - 1936 Soldier Field - 1932 Soldier Field - 1961 Soldier Field - 1974 Soldier Field - 1948 Soldier Field - 1927 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1927 Soldier Field - 1973 Soldier Field - 2003 Soldier Field - 1971 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1933 Soldier Field - 1939 Soldier Field - 1946 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 1943 Soldier Field - 1932 Soldier Field - 1974 Soldier Field - 1959 Soldier Field - 2003 Soldier Field - 2003 Soldier Field - 1931 Soldier Field - 1987 Soldier Field - 1926 Soldier Field - 1939 Soldier Field - 1962 Soldier Field - 1946 Soldier Field - 1932 Soldier Field - 1959 Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Locations Bloomington Tags Sports The Economy American Football Politics Construction Industry Law Trade Journalism City Planning Finance Architecture * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@nwitimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "brian_cassella@nwitimes.com", "name": "Brian Cassella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

J.B. Pritzker echoed previous public statements and again brushed aside the latest proposal -- which includes more than $2 billion in private funds from the Bears but still requires taxpayer subsidies, saying it \"isn't one that I think the taxpayers are interested in getting engaged in.\"\n\nThe cost of the project is estimated at $4.7 billion -- with $900 million coming from 40-year bonds issued by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, which are backed by the city's 2% hotel tax. But it also includes at least $325 million in taxpayer-backed infrastructure improvements to make the stadium and Museum Campus more accessible.\n\nAnd that's just to start the project. It would require another $1.2 billion in subsequent phases.\n\n\"I'm highly skeptical of the proposal that's been made and I believe strongly that this is not a high priority for legislators and certainly not for me, when I compare it to all the other things,\" Pritzker said at an unrelated press conference in southwest suburban New Lenox.\n\nThe Democratic governor noted that even on-field success has not helped in other cities like Kansas City, where voters rejected a measure that would have helped fund renovations for Arrowhead Stadium, home to the NFL's Super Bowl champion Chiefs, and a new ballpark for the Royals.\n\n\"Maybe one lesson that can be learned just from the last few years is stadium deals, and taxpayers putting money forward for stadium deals, [are] not particularly popular around the country. Take note that the winner of the Super Bowl this year, the team went out to try to get the stadium financed by the public and it was rejected by the public in a place where the Super Bowl champions reside,\" Pritzker said.\n\n\"And I think this is a recognition that these are private businesses. That the owners of these private businesses need to put a lot more forward ... [to] have their dreams fulfilled and not just rely upon the taxpayers of Illinois to make that happen for them.\"\n\nLater, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch, D-Hillside, publicly squashed the Bears chances of getting legislation passed during the current legislative session, which is scheduled to adjourn on May 24 but is likely to extend into the waning days of May.\n\n\"I want to say to you publicly what I said to Kevin Warren privately last week. If we were to put this issue on the board for a vote right now, it would fail, and it would fail miserably,\" Welch said at a separate press conference in Maywood. \"There's no environment for something like this today. Now, in Springfield, environments change. Will that environment change within the next 30 days? I think that's highly unlikely.\"\n\nIllinois Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, issued a statement showing he, like Pritzker, was cautious at best.\n\n\"At first glance, more than $2 billion in private funding is better than zero and a more credible opening offer,\" he said. \"But there's an obvious, substantial gap remaining, and I echo the governor's skepticism.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The team plans to \"host major concerts throughout the year as well as Super Bowls, Final Fours and Big Ten championship games.\" Though Soldier Field's famed colonnades would be preserved, the actual stadium installed in the previous renovation two decades ago would be \"torn out and replaced by playing fields as well as park space.\" The plan \"calls for a pedestrian mall, food and beverage options, a promenade and plaza\" (AP, 4/24). The Bears have pledged to contribute $2B to the project, and in Chicago, Laurence & Ecker wrote that would be a \"complicated mix of loans and future revenue streams that can be borrowed against to begin construction.\" The bulk of the money will \"come from revenue raised through marketing opportunities at the new stadium,\" including naming rights and loans from the NFL. The team also hopes to raise hundreds of millions through the sale of PSLs (CRAIN'S CHICAGO BUSINESS, 4/24).\n\nDO THE EVOLUTION: In Chicago, Spielman, Armentrout & Sfondeles wrote the proposed stadium, which was designed by architectural firm Manica, \"likely will be seen by many as a vast improvement over the much-criticized, spaceship-like seating bowl plopped onto Soldier Field's historic colonnades in 2003.\" Warren said that fans will be \"protected from the elements but 'feel like they're outside.'\" He indicated that the team \"considered but dismissed the possibility of a retractable roof, since it would have added hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost.\" It also \"likely would have been used just a handful of times each year\" (CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, 4/24).\n\nTRYING TO ACT FAST: In Chicago, Jason Lieser noted the Bears ideally would \"break ground on the stadium in 2025 and open it for the 2028 season,\" though that depends on the state passing a funding bill before the current session ends in May. A team spokesperson said that the venue will have \"roughly 65,000 seats,\" similar to Soldier Field, but \"hold a larger capacity because of increased standing-room-only areas.\" Capacity would be 77,000 for events like a Final Four (CHICAGO SUN-TIMES, 4/24).\n\nAPPEALING TO THE MASSES: In Chicago, Paul Sullivan after seeing the renderings and listening to Warren asked, \"How could anyone dare say no to this idea?\" The renderings \"did look kind of cool.\" There are \"so many reasons to get this done it boggles the mind,\" and the \"sooner the better before the White Sox ask for their handout.\" Sullivan: \"The No. 1 reason, of course, is the possibility of a getting Super Bowl down the road\" (CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 4/24).", "source": {"uri": "sportsbusinessjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbusinessjournal.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonnade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonnade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skyline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedestrian zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_square", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crain's_Chicago_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crain's Chicago Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Architectural firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naming rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sun-Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_(test)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ACT (test)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Design_and_Construction", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Design and Construction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/-/media/Images/Daily/2024/04/24/SOCIAL/SOCIAL-Bears-renderings.ashx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

J.B. Pritzker and the Democratic leaders in the state House and Senate made clear the team doesn't currently have the support it needs to make the architectural renderings a reality.\n\nWaukegan Mayor Ann Taylor said she knew inviting the Bears to explore putting a stadium on undeveloped lakefront property in June it was a longshot, but the team responded and she also heard from other developers who wanted to be part of any such project.\n\nThe hot-button lawsuits related to Northwestern University's hazing scandal -- some alleging widespread abuse on the football team, another claiming ex-coach Pat Fitzgerald was wrongly fired -- will be consolidated for the time being, a Cook County judge ruled this week.\n\nThe decision came after attorneys representing ex-players accused Northwestern's lawyers of using confidential information obtained in the former players' lawsuit to help craft their strategy in the separate Fitzgerald case. A lawyer for Northwestern denied that accusation in court.\n\nNot only will the couple's new combined duplex in the Park Tower set a Chicago price record for a completed Chicago condo, it also consists of units that previously had set record-setting purchase prices themselves.

The bill? $325 million to start, $1.5 billion overall", "body": "The Chicago Bears' drive for a new lakefront domed stadium won't break the line of scrimmage unless they receive at least $325 million in public funding for initial infrastructure upgrades to improve traffic flow into and out of a revamped Museum Campus, team officials said during their kickoff pitch Wednesday.\n\nAnd that's just for the first phase of improvements the Bears want to see around their potential new home, as well as a repurposed Soldier Field, according to Karen Murphy, the team's executive vice president of stadium development.\n\nTwo additional infrastructure phases that would \"maximize the site\" and bring \"additional opportunities for publicly owned amenities\" would bring taxpayers' tab to $1.5 billion over about five years, Murphy said.\n\n\"We would be excited if all three phases happened. We need Phase 1 to happen for our project specifically,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe initial stage -- if the team can line up state and/or federal funding for it -- would move the 18th Street interchange on DuSable Lake Shore Drive a block south, creating a new 19th Street interchange.\n\nThey would also add a new parking deck to the current surface lot south of Soldier Field, with a new access route from the south going through the McCormick Place Lakeside Center, according to the team's presentation.\n\nThe new stadium would go where the current Waldron Parking Deck sits, with the remainder of the $325 million covering utilities to open the stadium.\n\nThose parking upgrades and road changes would improve pedestrian and cyclist access, allow 25% more people onto the campus for big events and decrease exit times by 10 minutes, the team claims.\n\nThe second phase -- at a taxpayer cost of $510 million -- would gut the renovated interior of Soldier Field to turn it into multi-use sports fields, while installing additional parking. The plan would increase public park space by 20%, according to Mayor Brandon Johnson.\n\nA $665 million third infrastructure phase would include removing the stoplight on northbound Lake Shore Drive and create an underpass with access ramps to the campus, with a reconfigured exit to Columbus Drive.\n\nSeparate routes for pedestrian and vehicle traffic would improve access and traffic times, the team says, increasing capacity by 50% and cutting exit times by 20 minutes.\n\nThe priciest phase could also bring in public attractions including a sports museum, plus retail shops and restaurants to the campus, the team said.\n\nThe costs are all on top of the $900 million in state bonds backed by hotel tax revenues that the team needs to convince state lawmakers to agree to for the $3.2 billion stadium itself.\n\nMurphy said the team is still figuring out where to find the infrastructure dollars.\n\n\"We've been working closely with the state and looking at different available funding sources, if it's the state or the federal government, on how we can make it happen. For us, we need the $325 million to open the stadium,\" Murphy said. \"I will remind everyone that these infrastructure projects drive jobs, and they create economic impact.\"\n\nCity officials said Johnson's office won't ask the City Council to chip in for the infrastructure upgrades.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_Campus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Museum Campus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Shore_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Shore Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchange_(road)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interchange (road)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormick_Place", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McCormick Place"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Drive_(Chicago)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Drive (Chicago)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tunnel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Manitoba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Manitoba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Manitoba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3907b68/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3784x2160+28+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe2%2F9a%2F70f213a84002afed8f3e9e1ea5ad%2Fchicago-still-image-12-overall-site-lsd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9503122", "eventUri": "eng-9503122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

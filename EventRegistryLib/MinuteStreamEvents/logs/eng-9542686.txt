The former president argued that the erasure of a 50-year precedent that provided women a constitutional right to an abortion was a positive development.\n\n\"I say what the people decide, and whatever it is, it's within the state and what the people decide, and it's working out,\" said Trump. \"For many, many years, people have said we've gotta bring this back to the states to decide, and that's now working.\"\n\nTrump then outlined how different states were dealing with abortion rights, but appeared unaware that Michigan had already enshrined those rights in its constitution.\n\n\"All the states are deciding, and you know, for 53 years, people wanted to be able to get it out, Roe v Wade, get it out so the states can decide,\" Trump said. \"Your state [Michigan] will decide probably a liberal policy if it hasn't already done it. ... I think Michigan's gonna actually be very loose. They're gonna vote on it, and that's gonna be the law.\"\n\nIn 2022, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved securing the right to an abortion and other reproductive rights, less than six months after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause no longer provided a federal right to an abortion. Three of the six votes in favor of that decision were made by justices appointed to the court by Trump.\n\nTrump also told Raj the GOP was \"the party of fertilization because we are for the women,\" referencing one of the issues that resulted from the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, namely in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"We wanna help the women because they were gonna end fertilization, which is where when the IVF, where women go to the clinics and they get help in having a baby, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. And we're for it a 100%. They tried to say that they weren't for it. They actually weren't for it and aren't for it as much as us, but women see that,\" said Trump.\n\nThe IVF issue came to the forefront in February when the Alabama Supreme Court, citing the Dobbs decision nine times, ruled that embryos had the full legal rights of citizens. That left IVF clinics facing costly litigation, prompting a temporary halt to the procedure in that state until it passed a law extending criminal and civil immunity to IVF providers and patients. But because the measure didn't declare when life begins, clinics there are still moving away from providing the service out of litigation concerns.\n\nTrump's claim that \"they weren't for it,\" presumably meaning the Democratic Party, is false. In fact, Democrats like U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois -- a disabled veteran who used IVF to become a mother -- had been warning since at least 2022 that IVF would be the next target of GOP-led legislatures and courts if Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Republicans have rejected attempts to protect access to IVF treatments, while a bill sponsored by House Democrats, H.R. 7056, the Access to Family Building Act, which would establish a federal right to access assisted reproductive technology, including IVF, remains bottled up in committee by the Republican-led chamber.\n\nTrump continued to insist in the interview that abortion \"was not that big of an issue,\" and \"should be largely taken off the table.\"\n\nHe also continued to push the false claim that abortions were routinely being done in the final month of pregnancy, or beyond.\n\n\"Nobody wants to see abortions in the ninth month and the eighth month and the seventh month, and nobody wants to see abortions or, in this case, killing after the baby is born,\" Trump told Raj. \"Right now, that's what the Democrats can do. They can have it in the seventh, eighth, ninth month, and they can kill the baby. In numerous states, they can kill the baby after the baby is born, and nobody wants that. Nobody.\"\n\nSince at least 2016, Trump has been making the claim of abortions in the final days of pregnancy or even killing babies after they are born, and it has been fact-checked time and again as false.\n\nAnd according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1% of all abortions are performed after 21 weeks of gestation -- in the fifth month of pregnancy..\n\nRaj asked Trump about Florida's six-week abortion ban that went into effect last week.\n\n\"You have to understand, every legal scholar from all over the country, all over the world, they said 'You have to get abortion out of the federal government, you have to take it away from the federal government, give it to the states', and now that's what we've been able to do. We've given it to the states, and some states have already decided, and people are satisfied with it.\"\n\nWhile there were certainly scholars who believed Roe had been decided incorrectly, they didn't represent a majority, much less anything close to unanimity.\n\n\"Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\" Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, told CNN, which quoted several other legal experts in fact-checking that assertion as false.\n\n\"The people within the states ... they seem to be very happy with the way it's working out,\" added Trump.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, since the overturning of Roe, 30 states have enacted abortion policies that range from restrictive to the most restrictive.\n\nRaj also asked Trump about labor policies, unions, immigration and the war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhen asked about the success of union efforts in southern states, such as the UAW's historic victory last month with Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tenn., who voted by a nearly 3-1 margin to join the UAW, Trump instead talked about China building car plants in Mexico, insisted the public didn't want all electric vehicles (EVs) and ended up in a diatribe against President Joe Biden.\n\n\"This character that's destroyed our country, the worst president we've ever had, without question,\" said Trump. \"He's destroying our country. What he's doing with cars, he's forcing the auto industry into China and other countries, and it's so sad. And, by the way, Mexico is doing things that nobody can believe. They just started, and they're doing them in conjunction with China, and it's gotta be stopped. We can't let that happen.\"\n\nRaj restated his question about growing union support in states like Tennessee that have been less than welcoming to organized labor in the past.\n\n\"Well, it could be happening,\" Trump said. \"I mean, it's gonna be happening, but you gotta be very careful about what's gonna happen in two years from now when China wants to take all of the jobs. Because frankly, then union or non-union, everybody's gonna be hurt. Everybody.\"\n\nThere have been concerns about Chinese automakers looking to avoid U.S. tariffs by building vehicles in Mexico and the Biden administration has addressed the issue. Last month, Reuters reported that under pressure from the U.S., Mexico was refusing to offer Chinese automakers incentives to build factories there such as low-cost public land or tax cuts for investment in EV production.\n\nThe report also quoted an official with the Office of the United States Trade Representative as saying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was negotiated during the Trump Administration, did not allow \"a back door to China and others who may be seeking to access our market without paying ... tariffs.\"\n\nOn the topic of Israeli military attacks against Hamas in Gaza, in which more than 34,000 people have been killed according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, Trump was asked how he would try and end the hostilities, and indicated he would give Israel a free hand.\n\n\"You gotta finish it off fast. You gotta get it done, and then you gotta have peace. And we'll make peace fast. But you gotta get your work done and you gotta have peace. You know that Oct. 7 was terrible,\" Trump said, referring to Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians that killed about 1,200 people.\n\nThe interview closed with Raj asking Trump if he would debate Biden on statewide television in Michigan.\n\n\"If you can get him, I'm there. I'll go anywhere he wants to go,\" said Trump. \"What he's done to Michigan is so bad. What he's done to our country is so bad. What other man, what other person, would allow 15, 16 million people right now in our country? They came from prisons and jails. They came from insane asylums and mental institutions, not from South America, from all over the world, they're pouring into our country at levels that nobody's ever seen. Drug dealers. One stat before we go, Venezuela was very crime-ridden. They announced the other day 72% reduction in crime in the last year. You know why? They moved all their criminals from Venezuela right into the good old USA, and Biden let them do it. It's a disgrace.\"\n\n\"But, sir, where are those numbers coming from?\" asked Raj.\n\n\"I guess I get them from the papers in this case. I think it's a federal statement or well, they're coming actually from Venezuela. They're coming from Venezuela. That's where they can't come from,\" said Trump.\n\nPunishing sanctions imposed against Venezuela during the Trump administration have been blamed as at least one cause of the mass migration out of that nation. Trump also didn't mention that one of his last acts as President was to give Venezuelan exiles in the U.S. illegally protection from deportation.\n\nMichigan Advance is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

The former president argued that the erasure of a 50-year precedent that provided women a constitutional right to an abortion was a positive development.\n\n\"I say what the people decide, and whatever it is, it's within the state and what the people decide, and it's working out,\" said Trump. \"For many, many years, people have said we've gotta bring this back to the states to decide, and that's now working.\"\n\nTrump then outlined how different states were dealing with abortion rights, but appeared unaware that Michigan had already enshrined those rights in its constitution.\n\n\"All the states are deciding, and you know, for 53 years, people wanted to be able to get it out, Roe v Wade, get it out so the states can decide,\" Trump said. \"Your state [Michigan] will decide probably a liberal policy if it hasn't already done it. ... I think Michigan's gonna actually be very loose. They're gonna vote on it, and that's gonna be the law.\"\n\nIn 2022, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved securing the right to an abortion and other reproductive rights, less than six months after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause no longer provided a federal right to an abortion. Three of the six votes in favor of that decision were made by justices appointed to the court by Trump.\n\nPro-Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Proposal 3 sign in Ann Arbor, Nov. 8, 2022 | Laina G. Stebbins\n\nTrump also told Raj the GOP was \"the party of fertilization because we are for the women,\" referencing one of the issues that resulted from the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, namely in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"We wanna help the women because they were gonna end fertilization, which is where when the IVF, where women go to the clinics and they get help in having a baby, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. And we're for it a 100%. They tried to say that they weren't for it. They actually weren't for it and aren't for it as much as us, but women see that,\" said Trump.\n\nThe IVF issue came to the forefront in February when the Alabama Supreme Court, citing the Dobbs decision nine times, ruled that embryos had the full legal rights of citizens. That left IVF clinics facing costly litigation, prompting a temporary halt to the procedure in that state until it passed a law extending criminal and civil immunity to IVF providers and patients. But because the measure didn't declare when life begins, clinics there are still moving away from providing the service out of litigation concerns.\n\nTrump's claim that \"they weren't for it,\" presumably meaning the Democratic Party, is false. In fact, Democrats like U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois -- a disabled veteran who used IVF to become a mother -- had been warning since at least 2022 that IVF would be the next target of GOP-led legislatures and courts if Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Republicans have rejected attempts to protect access to IVF treatments, while a bill sponsored by House Democrats, H.R. 7056, the Access to Family Building Act, which would establish a federal right to access assisted reproductive technology, including IVF, remains bottled up in committee by the Republican-led chamber.\n\nTrump continued to insist in the interview that abortion \"was not that big of an issue,\" and \"should be largely taken off the table.\"\n\nHe also continued to push the false claim that abortions were routinely being done in the final month of pregnancy, or beyond.\n\n\"Nobody wants to see abortions in the ninth month and the eighth month and the seventh month, and nobody wants to see abortions or, in this case, killing after the baby is born,\" Trump told Raj. \"Right now, that's what the Democrats can do. They can have it in the seventh, eighth, ninth month, and they can kill the baby. In numerous states, they can kill the baby after the baby is born, and nobody wants that. Nobody.\"\n\nSince at least 2016, Trump has been making the claim of abortions in the final days of pregnancy or even killing babies after they are born, and it has been fact-checked time and again as false.\n\nAnd according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1% of all abortions are performed after 21 weeks of gestation -- in the fifth month of pregnancy..\n\nRaj asked Trump about Florida's six-week abortion ban that went into effect last week.\n\n\"You have to understand, every legal scholar from all over the country, all over the world, they said 'You have to get abortion out of the federal government, you have to take it away from the federal government, give it to the states', and now that's what we've been able to do. We've given it to the states, and some states have already decided, and people are satisfied with it.\"\n\nWhile there were certainly scholars who believed Roe had been decided incorrectly, they didn't represent a majority, much less anything close to unanimity.\n\n\"Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\" Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, told CNN, which quoted several other legal experts in fact-checking that assertion as false.\n\n\"The people within the states ... they seem to be very happy with the way it's working out,\" added Trump.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, since the overturning of Roe, 30 states have enacted abortion policies that range from restrictive to the most restrictive.\n\nRaj also asked Trump about labor policies, unions, immigration and the war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhen asked about the success of union efforts in southern states, such as the UAW's historic victory last month with Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tenn., who voted by a nearly 3-1 margin to join the UAW, Trump instead talked about China building car plants in Mexico, insisted the public didn't want all electric vehicles (EVs) and ended up in a diatribe against President Joe Biden.\n\n\"This character that's destroyed our country, the worst president we've ever had, without question,\" said Trump. \"He's destroying our country. What he's doing with cars, he's forcing the auto industry into China and other countries, and it's so sad. And, by the way, Mexico is doing things that nobody can believe. They just started, and they're doing them in conjunction with China, and it's gotta be stopped. We can't let that happen.\"\n\nRaj restated his question about growing union support in states like Tennessee that have been less than welcoming to organized labor in the past.\n\n\"Well, it could be happening,\" Trump said. \"I mean, it's gonna be happening, but you gotta be very careful about what's gonna happen in two years from now when China wants to take all of the jobs. Because frankly, then union or non-union, everybody's gonna be hurt. Everybody.\"\n\nThere have been concerns about Chinese automakers looking to avoid U.S. tariffs by building vehicles in Mexico and the Biden administration has addressed the issue. Last month, Reuters reported that under pressure from the U.S., Mexico was refusing to offer Chinese automakers incentives to build factories there such as low-cost public land or tax cuts for investment in EV production.\n\nThe report also quoted an official with the Office of the United States Trade Representative as saying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was negotiated during the Trump Administration, did not allow \"a back door to China and others who may be seeking to access our market without paying ... tariffs.\"\n\nOn the topic of Israeli military attacks against Hamas in Gaza, in which more than 34,000 people have been killed according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, Trump was asked how he would try and end the hostilities, and indicated he would give Israel a free hand.\n\nA general view over the Gaza Strip as seen from the Israeli side of the border on January 8, 2024 in Southern Israel. | Amir Levy/Getty Images\n\n\"You gotta finish it off fast. You gotta get it done, and then you gotta have peace. And we'll make peace fast. But you gotta get your work done and you gotta have peace. You know that Oct. 7 was terrible,\" Trump said, referring to Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians that killed about 1,200 people.\n\nThe interview closed with Raj asking Trump if he would debate Biden on statewide television in Michigan.\n\n\"If you can get him, I'm there. I'll go anywhere he wants to go,\" said Trump. \"What he's done to Michigan is so bad. What he's done to our country is so bad. What other man, what other person, would allow 15, 16 million people right now in our country? They came from prisons and jails. They came from insane asylums and mental institutions, not from South America, from all over the world, they're pouring into our country at levels that nobody's ever seen. Drug dealers. One stat before we go, Venezuela was very crime-ridden. They announced the other day 72% reduction in crime in the last year. You know why? They moved all their criminals from Venezuela right into the good old USA, and Biden let them do it. It's a disgrace.\"\n\n\"But, sir, where are those numbers coming from?\" asked Raj.\n\n\"I guess I get them from the papers in this case. I think it's a federal statement or well, they're coming actually from Venezuela. They're coming from Venezuela. That's where they can't come from,\" said Trump.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The former president argued that the erasure of a 50-year precedent that provided women a constitutional right to an abortion was a positive development.\n\n\"I say what the people decide, and whatever it is, it's within the state and what the people decide, and it's working out,\" said Trump. \"For many, many years, people have said we've gotta bring this back to the states to decide, and that's now working.\"\n\nTrump then outlined how different states were dealing with abortion rights, but appeared unaware that Michigan had already enshrined those rights in its constitution.\n\n\"All the states are deciding, and you know, for 53 years, people wanted to be able to get it out, Roe v Wade, get it out so the states can decide,\" Trump said. \"Your state [Michigan] will decide probably a liberal policy if it hasn't already done it. ... I think Michigan's gonna actually be very loose. They're gonna vote on it, and that's gonna be the law.\"\n\nIn 2022, Michigan voters overwhelmingly approved securing the right to an abortion and other reproductive rights, less than six months after the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause no longer provided a federal right to an abortion. Three of the six votes in favor of that decision were made by justices appointed to the court by Trump.\n\nTrump also told Raj the GOP was \"the party of fertilization because we are for the women,\" referencing one of the issues that resulted from the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, namely in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\n\"We wanna help the women because they were gonna end fertilization, which is where when the IVF, where women go to the clinics and they get help in having a baby, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. And we're for it a 100%. They tried to say that they weren't for it. They actually weren't for it and aren't for it as much as us, but women see that,\" said Trump.\n\nThe IVF issue came to the forefront in February when the Alabama Supreme Court, citing the Dobbs decision nine times, ruled that embryos had the full legal rights of citizens. That left IVF clinics facing costly litigation, prompting a temporary halt to the procedure in that state until it passed a law extending criminal and civil immunity to IVF providers and patients. But because the measure didn't declare when life begins, clinics there are still moving away from providing the service out of litigation concerns.\n\nTrump's claim that \"they weren't for it,\" presumably meaning the Democratic Party, is false. In fact, Democrats like U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois -- a disabled veteran who used IVF to become a mother -- had been warning since at least 2022 that IVF would be the next target of GOP-led legislatures and courts if Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Republicans have rejected attempts to protect access to IVF treatments, while a bill sponsored by House Democrats, H.R. 7056, the Access to Family Building Act, which would establish a federal right to access assisted reproductive technology, including IVF, remains bottled up in committee by the Republican-led chamber.\n\nTrump continued to insist in the interview that abortion \"was not that big of an issue,\" and \"should be largely taken off the table.\"\n\nHe also continued to push the false claim that abortions were routinely being done in the final month of pregnancy, or beyond.\n\n\"Nobody wants to see abortions in the ninth month and the eighth month and the seventh month, and nobody wants to see abortions or, in this case, killing after the baby is born,\" Trump told Raj. \"Right now, that's what the Democrats can do. They can have it in the seventh, eighth, ninth month, and they can kill the baby. In numerous states, they can kill the baby after the baby is born, and nobody wants that. Nobody.\"\n\nSince at least 2016, Trump has been making the claim of abortions in the final days of pregnancy or even killing babies after they are born, and it has been fact-checked time and again as false.\n\nAnd according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1% of all abortions are performed after 21 weeks of gestation -- in the fifth month of pregnancy..\n\nRaj asked Trump about Florida's six-week abortion ban that went into effect last week.\n\n\"You have to understand, every legal scholar from all over the country, all over the world, they said 'You have to get abortion out of the federal government, you have to take it away from the federal government, give it to the states', and now that's what we've been able to do. We've given it to the states, and some states have already decided, and people are satisfied with it.\"\n\nWhile there were certainly scholars who believed Roe had been decided incorrectly, they didn't represent a majority, much less anything close to unanimity.\n\n\"Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,\" Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, told CNN, which quoted several other legal experts in fact-checking that assertion as false.\n\n\"The people within the states ... they seem to be very happy with the way it's working out,\" added Trump.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights, since the overturning of Roe, 30 states have enacted abortion policies that range from restrictive to the most restrictive.\n\nRaj also asked Trump about labor policies, unions, immigration and the war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhen asked about the success of union efforts in southern states, such as the UAW's historic victory last month with Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga, Tenn., who voted by a nearly 3-1 margin to join the UAW, Trump instead talked about China building car plants in Mexico, insisted the public didn't want all electric vehicles (EVs) and ended up in a diatribe against President Joe Biden.\n\n\"This character that's destroyed our country, the worst president we've ever had, without question,\" said Trump. \"He's destroying our country. What he's doing with cars, he's forcing the auto industry into China and other countries, and it's so sad. And, by the way, Mexico is doing things that nobody can believe. They just started, and they're doing them in conjunction with China, and it's gotta be stopped. We can't let that happen.\"\n\nRaj restated his question about growing union support in states like Tennessee that have been less than welcoming to organized labor in the past.\n\n\"Well, it could be happening,\" Trump said. \"I mean, it's gonna be happening, but you gotta be very careful about what's gonna happen in two years from now when China wants to take all of the jobs. Because frankly, then union or non-union, everybody's gonna be hurt. Everybody.\"\n\nThere have been concerns about Chinese automakers looking to avoid U.S. tariffs by building vehicles in Mexico and the Biden administration has addressed the issue. Last month, Reuters reported that under pressure from the U.S., Mexico was refusing to offer Chinese automakers incentives to build factories there such as low-cost public land or tax cuts for investment in EV production.\n\nThe report also quoted an official with the Office of the United States Trade Representative as saying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was negotiated during the Trump Administration, did not allow \"a back door to China and others who may be seeking to access our market without paying ... tariffs.\"\n\nOn the topic of Israeli military attacks against Hamas in Gaza, in which more than 34,000 people have been killed according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza, Trump was asked how he would try and end the hostilities, and indicated he would give Israel a free hand.\n\n\"You gotta finish it off fast. You gotta get it done, and then you gotta have peace. And we'll make peace fast. But you gotta get your work done and you gotta have peace. You know that Oct. 7 was terrible,\" Trump said, referring to Hamas' terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians that killed about 1,200 people.\n\nThe interview closed with Raj asking Trump if he would debate Biden on statewide television in Michigan.\n\n\"If you can get him, I'm there. I'll go anywhere he wants to go,\" said Trump. \"What he's done to Michigan is so bad. What he's done to our country is so bad. What other man, what other person, would allow 15, 16 million people right now in our country? They came from prisons and jails. They came from insane asylums and mental institutions, not from South America, from all over the world, they're pouring into our country at levels that nobody's ever seen. Drug dealers. One stat before we go, Venezuela was very crime-ridden. They announced the other day 72% reduction in crime in the last year. You know why? They moved all their criminals from Venezuela right into the good old USA, and Biden let them do it. It's a disgrace.\"\n\n\"But, sir, where are those numbers coming from?\" asked Raj.\n\n\"I guess I get them from the papers in this case. I think it's a federal statement or well, they're coming actually from Venezuela. They're coming from Venezuela. That's where they can't come from,\" said Trump.\n\nPunishing sanctions imposed against Venezuela during the Trump administration have been blamed as at least one cause of the mass migration out of that nation. Trump also didn't mention that one of his last acts as President was to give Venezuelan exiles in the U.S. illegally protection from deportation.\n\nMichigan Advance is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Many others are in the process of choosing,\" he continued. \"Arizona's Legislature has just voted to kill an old 1800's law, and a new one will soon be voted on by the people.\"\n\nNote: Republicans wanted that archaic law to remain. They voted on it 3 times before it was finally stricken down.\n\n\"It is all working, will never go back to the Federal Government, and our Country will soon start uniting on this long contentious issue. At the same time, nobody wants to see abortion in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month or, execution after birth, as some states, like the former Democrat Governor of Virginia said, was permitted,\" Trump added. \"Listen to your heart, but common sense must also be applied. Remember, politicians must also win elections!\"\n\nI'm not sure what that last line means, but I'm sure it was super duper important. We covered the Time interview.\n\n\"More than 20 states now have full or partial abortion bans, and Trump says those policies should be left to the states to do what they want, including monitoring women's pregnancies. \"I think they might do that,\" he says. The interviewer continues, \"When I ask whether he would be comfortable with states prosecuting women for having abortions beyond the point the laws permit, he says, \"It's irrelevant whether I'm comfortable or not. It's totally irrelevant because the states are going to make those decisions.\" President Biden has said he would fight state anti-abortion measures in court and with regulation.\"", "source": {"uri": "crooksandliars.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crooks and Liars"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conover_kennard@crooksandliars.com", "name": "Conover Kennard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States'_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States' rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Re-elect Joe Biden. | Opinion", "body": "Gov. Gretchen Whitmer repealed a handful of abortion restrictions in Michigan, making changes long-awaited by abortion rights proponents.\n\nTIME: \"Do you think states should monitor women's pregnancies so they can know if they've gotten an abortion after the ban?\n\nDonald Trump: \"I think they might do that.\"\n\nI read these chilling words from Donald Trump's TIME interview just before a meeting with women and doctors in Flint. We had stepped into a bookstore together for a conversation we thought would be focused on abortion bans across the country. Florida's six-week ban, which means abortions are banned before many women even know they are pregnant, would go into effect that same day. But as Stephanie, Harsna, Jessica and I took our seats, we found ourselves unpacking the reality that Donald Trump was, according to his interview, leaving the door open for states to track women's periods and pregnancies, and prosecute women who have an abortion.\n\nThe women around the table told me how much it meant to them that here in Michigan, reproductive freedom is protected. But, I have to be honest, the thing going through my mind was: If Donald Trump wins again, I can't prevent all the protections we fought so hard for in Michigan from being erased.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nMichiganders wasted no time after Roe fell: We amended our constitution to guarantee the right to abortion. I worked with the state legislature to remove medically unnecessary, politically motivated restrictions on abortion from state law. And since then, I've directed my administration to explore every option to protect access to surrogacy and IVF so Michiganders can grow their families. I am relieved and proud that Michigan was able to put in place strong protections to keep reproductive decisions in the hands of women and the people they trust. Progress like this in a purple state is unprecedented.\n\nBut Donald Trump and the right-wing groups who support him want to hit the ground running with policies that would put Michigan's protections in jeopardy. They want to allow the government to invade women's privacy and monitor their pregnancies, restrict access to IVF and contraception, and outlaw the distribution of abortion pills. And their North Star, a national abortion ban, could effectively cancel out Michigan's constitutional protections.\n\nDonald Trump is hearing the outcry from voters from Florida to Alabama to Arizona and Michigan loud and clear. That's why he's trying to hide his anti-abortion record and plans. He's betting voters will buy what he's selling without looking too closely.\n\nBut I know voters -- especially Michigan voters -- are smart. They are women like Stephanie, Harsna and Jessica. And what they'll see as they go vote is alarming.\n\nThey'll see that Donald Trump is the reason women are having to wait until they go into sepsis for lifesaving abortion care. He's the reason states have enacted policies that threaten medical providers with jail time. He's the reason that in Florida, abortion is not only banned before many women even know they are pregnant, but survivors of rape can only get an abortion if they can provide documentation to prove it. He's the reason women in Arizona woke up to the news this spring that they were living under an abortion ban from 1864.\n\nFight for abortion access in Michigan will never be over. Here's what we can do\n\nThey see what Donald Trump is really for. But, I know they won't let him get away with it.\n\nRegardless of how he tries to dance around it leading up to Election Day, we know exactly where Donald Trump stands on abortion. It's playing out all across the country.\n\nWe know where President Biden stands, too: with women, guided by a firm belief that politicians shouldn't get to make these personal, private decisions. And if we want Michigan's protections to stay in place, we need Joe Biden back in the White House.\n\nI'm a mom of two wonderful daughters who are growing up with fewer rights than I had at their age. I myself have lived my entire adult life with the constitutional right to abortion. It's easy to give in to a feeling that this will take a long time to reverse. But it doesn't have to, if Michigan shows Donald Trump and extreme Republicans exactly what we think of them taking away our rights.\n\nWe know this race is going to be close, and we know the path to the White House runs through Michigan. Follow the leadership of the women I met with in Flint, or the women who passed our ballot measure to protect reproductive freedom, or the women who made their voices heard at the historic Women's March. Get involved, doorknock, and most importantly, make sure your friends and family vote. Our freedoms depend on it, here in Michigan and everywhere else.\n\nI'll fight like hell, too.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red states and blue states"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Like President Biden, Trump's position now is different from what it was before he got into politics. He previously said he supported the right to choose. However, in a recent Truth Social post, Trump expressed satisfaction that he was able to overturn Roe.\n\n\"I was proudly the person responsible,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump points to appointing three Supreme Court justices to the high court who ultimately supported the overturning of Roe.\n\nTwenty-one states now ban abortion or restrict the procedure earlier in pregnancy than the standard set by Roe.\n\nIn a recent interview with Time Magazine, Trump said he was fine with states monitoring pregnancies and even possibly prosecuting someone for getting an abortion.

Wade.\n\nDuring an interview last week with a local Michigan TV station FOX-2 Detroit, Trump repeatedly downplayed the significance of abortion rights on the national stage -- despite it being a driving factor in Democrats' strong performance at the ballot box in the aftermath of the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade in 2022.\n\nRecent polling shows many voters see the 2024 election as a high-stakes election for the future of abortion and contraception access. President Joe Biden has made the issue central to his campaign, as have countless Democratic candidates.\n\n\"I think the abortion issue should be largely taken off the table because the individual states are doing what they're doing,\" the GOP presidential hopeful said.\n\n\"It's really not that big of an issue,\" he added.\n\nTrump suggested it was actually a good thing for women that the 6-3 conservative-led court overturned a 50-year precedent guaranteeing women a constitutional right to abortion. He put three of those conservative justices onto the court when he was president.\n\n\"I say, what the people decide, and whatever it is, it's within the state and what the people decide, and it's working out,\" he said. \"For many, many years, people have said we've got to bring this back to the states to decide, and that's now working.\"\n\nTrump also called the GOP the \"party of fertilization,\" apparently trying to make the case that Republicans have fought to ensure women's access to in vitro fertilization, or IVF. But not only is that false, he lost that point completely in an indecipherable word salad.\n\n\"We want to help the women because they were going to end fertilization, which is where, when the IVF, where women go to the clinics and they get help in having a baby, and that's a good thing, not a bad thing. And we're for it a 100%. They tried to say that they weren't for it. They actually weren't for it and aren't for it as much as us, but women see that,\" he said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have long opposed women's access to IVF. The only reason it's getting national attention now -- and that Trump is talking about it -- is because the Alabama Supreme Court ruled earlier this year a frozen embryo is \"a child,\" a decision resulting in IVF clinics halting their services around the state because they didn't want to face prosecution or lawsuits by discarding unused embryos. Alabama Republican legislators soon scrambled to pass a new law to give IVF clinics immunity from lawsuits, but they did not take up a bill to revisit the state's legal status of embryos.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Trump falselyclaimed that women routinely have abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, said women are somehow having abortions after the ninth month and are able to \"kill the baby after the baby is born,\" and that \"every legal scholar ... all over the world\" supported overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"You have to understand, every legal scholar from all over the country, all over the world, they said, 'You have to get abortion out of the federal government, you have to take it away from the federal government, give it to the states,' and now that's what we've been able to do,\" he boasted of throwing out Roe v.

When asked whether he thought states should monitor women's pregnancies so they can determine whether they violated an abortion ban, Trump replied \"I think they might do that.\" However, the former president also refused to endorse such tactics, and refused to endorse any hypothetical state restrictions on abortion, such as a 15-week ban. \"I don't have to be comfortable or uncomfortable,\" Trump said. \"The states are going to make that decision. The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me.\"\n\nTrump previously said he would refuse to sign a federal abortion ban, but in his interview last week, he also refused to confirm whether he would veto such a bill if Congress were to pass it. \"There will never be that chance because it won't happen,\" Trump told Time. \"You're never going to have 60 votes. You're not going to have it for many, many years, whether it be Democrat or Republican. Right now, it's essentially 50-50.\" On Sunday, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., echoed Trump's new position in a \"Meet the Press\" appearance. Scott, who is a contender for Trump's vice presidential nomination, previously said he would \"advocate and fight for, at the minimum, a 15-week limit.\" Scott refused to comment on whether he still supported a 15-week ban, instead telling host Kristen Welker \"it will never get to the president's desk.\"\n\nTrump and Scott both repeated a misleading claim that some Democrats advocate for \"execution after birth,\" a hypothetical after-birth abortion. \"Nobody wants to see abortion in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month or, execution after birth, as some states, like the former Democrat Governor of Virginia said, was permitted,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, apparently referring to comments made by former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 on a local news radio show. \"When we talk about third trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of the mother, with the consent of the physicians -- more than one physician, by the way,\" said Northam, who was a pediatrician before running for office. \"And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that's nonviable. So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, the infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. We want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.\" Trump has repeated the claim about \"executions after birth\" since at least 2020, and Scott appeared to echo this comment as well, telling Welker that Northam and other Democrats supported \"infanticide.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Welker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Welker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Northam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Northam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infanticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6637a2c44b987427efdbf24e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2000,1124,x0,y34,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542686", "eventUri": "eng-9542686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He tried to dodge the question by saying it would be up to \"the individual states\" now that Roe v. Wade was overturned, then refused to say what he thought about several follow-up questions.\n\nIf Trump thought this worked at the time, he no longer seems so confident that he settled the issue, taking to social media over the weekend to clarify things in a typically unclarifying way.\n\n\"I never said that 'some states may choose to monitor women's pregnancies to possibly prosecute for violating any abortion bans.' This was made up by Democrats and the Fake News Media,\" Trump posted Sunday on Truth Social.\n\n(Again, he said precisely that. You can read the transcript here.)\n\n\"After 50 years, Abortion is now up to the States, where everybody, Republican and Democrat, plus all legal scholars and experts, have wanted it to be,\" he said. \"The people choose, and many States, like Ohio and Kansas, have chosen. Many others are in the process of choosing.\"\n\nTrump is a habitual liar, so we know by now not to take his denials as fact. To state the obvious, \"everybody\" isn't happy about the loss of federal abortion rights and the patchwork of anti-abortion states that emerged as a result. But Trump's denial is undercut by the following sentence. The vague statement that \"abortion is now up to the states\" implies that states, during a Trump presidency, would be given free rein to institute whatever draconian anti-abortion measures they want, including pregnancy surveillance.\n\nSo even if one were to argue that Trump wasn't being suggestive with his comments -- as in, saying states should monitor pregnancies -- clearly he was being permissive of this -- meaning officials, under a Trump administration, could monitor pregnancies. And that's what matters.\n\nTrump's hair-splitting underscores an obvious fact about his campaign: He's trying to reap the benefits of opposing abortion rights without facing any of the backlash. But he could have easily said that setting up a Big Brother-like surveillance of women's pregnancies to punish women who may have gotten an abortion would go too far, and he didn't. After facing some pushback, he got angry, but he still didn't say that he would not allow that.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade.\n\nBut, as Trump reminds voters, he can't stop Biden's abortion agenda if he's not elected.\n\nTrump said at one point during a recent speech that \"getting elected is also important ... a lot of bad things will happen beyond abortion if you don't win.\"\n\nTrump also told supporters that abortion is a risky issue for Republican candidates, and \"you have to get elected\" in order to get anything done about protecting more babies from abortions.\n\nThe Biden administration has employed a whole-of-government approach to promoting abortion, using every lever of power at its disposal to make abortions more available and more common, with no thought of the innocent unborn children who will die or the mothers who could be harmed.\n\n\"This administration has done more to bring harm to mothers and their unborn babies through abortion than any other administration,\" said Carol Tobias of National Right to Life.", "source": {"uri": "lifenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_ertelt@lifenews.com", "name": "Steven Ertelt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_the_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meet the Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Wade 410 U.S. 113 (1973), then-President Donald J. Trump delivered.\n\nThanks to three U.S. Supreme Court justices he appointed, Roe was dumped in the ashbin of history, with the high court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organizaiton 597 U.S. 215 (2022).\n\nDobbs restored the power over abortion laws to the states.\n\nBut instead of celebrating this return to state sovereignty, some conservatives are now wanting Congress to impose nationwide restrictions on abortion.\n\nWhile the hearts of these activists are in the right place, this push for federal intervention could jeopardize the campaigns of GOP candidates up and down the ballot in November.\n\nConsider the electoral rebuke on the issue since the repeal of Roe, with much of the backlash in states considered \"solid red.\"\n\nLess than a year after the Supreme Court's decision, amendments were rejected in Kentucky, Kansas and Montana that would have imposed further restrictions on existing abortion laws.\n\nTo put things in perspective, President Trump won Kentucky by nearly 30 points just two years earlier, and both Kansas and Montana by over 15 points.\n\nDespite President Joe Biden's approval rating hovering below 50%, which historically translates into a loss of around 40 House seats for the party in power, what was supposed to be a Republican wave in the 2022 midterms turned into a mere splash. When all the votes were counted, Democrats only lost nine seats total, far exceeding expectations.\n\nAbortion, once a peripheral issue for candidates, transformed into one that galvanized voters on both sides of the aisle. Ultimately, the pro abortion-rights camp proved to be more effective in their messaging and better equipped to win elections.\n\n2023 wasn't much better for the anti-abortion camp.\n\nVoters in Ohio enshrined abortion rights into their state constitution, Gov. Andy Beshear, D-Ky., won reelection on the issue, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., saw his legislature flip to Democrats who made abortion a major issue in their campaigns.\n\nTo date, every time the issue has been placed before voters in states, pro abortion-rights policies have emerged victorious.\n\nWhile these outcomes are considered defeats by many in the ant-abortion camp, conservatives should be celebrating the democratic processes taking place at the state level.\n\nAs conservatives, we are believers in limited government. By overturning Roe, the Supreme Court championed the 10th Amendment - and by extension, the Bill of Rights - by empowering states to control their own policies on abortion.\n\nWhile abortion will likely remain with few restrictions in states like California, New York and Illinois, the procedure is now illegal with certain exceptions in 14 states.\n\nThree additional states have adopted \"fetal heartbeat bills,\" which makes abortion illegal as early as six weeks.\n\nMore states are considering similar bans or restrictions, none of which would have been possible prior to the overturn of Roe.\n\nThose in the anti-abortion camp should embrace such empowerment of local government, as such freedom has allowed states like Texas and Florida to experiment with different types of regulation and policies to see what approach works best in their states.\n\nWith states already responsible for pivotal issues like death penalty, gun policies and taxation, it seems logical and consistent that abortion should be decided on a state-by-state basis as well.\n\nThis is also a textbook example of how America's Founders intended federalism to operate, with states adopting legislation that fits their constituents needs.\n\nMore importantly, such a set-up provides an opportunity for the anti-abortion camp to energize voters at the local level and influence abortion policies in all 50 states.\n\nWhile the ballot referendum process to date has been a string of victories for pro abortion-rights activists, that could easily end with the adoption of better messaging and more robust grassroots activism from the anti-abortion camp.\n\nA total abortion ban in some states might be unrealistic, but more moderate policies like parental notification laws could certainly gain ground.\n\nRoe is a prime example of judicial activism, having effectively legalized abortion overnight at the expense of state governments.\n\nWhen Roe became the law of the land in 1973, several states had already legalized abortion, with more poised to follow.\n\nEven former Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an icon of women's rights groups, criticized Roe for putting the brakes on a political process that was organically moving towards legalizing abortion on a state-by-state basis.\n\nTo those pushing for federal legislation, it's important to remember how we arrived at our current situation. It was federal overreach that intensified an already contentious issue.\n\nLet's not repeat the same mistake. Instead, let's give the 10th Amendment the respect it deserves - and that our Founders intended.\n\nJacob Lane is a Republican strategist and school choice activist.

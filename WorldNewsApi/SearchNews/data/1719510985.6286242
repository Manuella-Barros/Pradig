Belfast Live covered the story of young Lola Jones earlier this year. The five-year-old from Portadown also suffers from other atopic diseases such as severe eczema, asthma and hayfever. Her parents hope to take Lola to the Food Allergy Institute in California to give their daughter \"the life of freedom she deserves\". That comes with a significant cost, and the youngster's family hope to raise more much-needed funds through the 'Continental Futsal Cup' on Saturday, June 1.

We have five teams - Northern Ireland, Europe, Americas, Africa and Asia. \"They will play futsal matches (indoor football) to see who is crowned Continent Kings. We have some spaces left on each team - player entry fee is \u00a320 with all money going towards Lola's medical treatment. \"APR Football have also kindly said they would come along on the day and people can pay to use their technology to test their passing, receiving and awareness - they are donating all money towards Lola as well. \"We would love to fill up each team and get the word out to people. We would also love people to come along and spectate - there will be a raffle and tombola on the day. It will be family friendly and a great day. \"Anyone can sign up to play, no futsal experience needed!\" Lola was born with life-threatening food allergies which were discovered when she was about six months old. It happened after she was left hospitalised after taking a negative reaction to formula milk. Subsequent tests confirmed she was anaphylactic to cows milk, which includes any product that contains it, eggs, peanuts and all tree nuts (almonds, cashews, hazelnut, pistachios etc) which would mean carrying epipens everywhere she goes for the rest of her life. Speaking earlier this year, Emily told Belfast Live: \"This diagnosis turned our lives upside down as every single moment of every day, we have to be so careful that Lola doesn't touch, eat or inhale any of her allergens, as the result could be deadly. \"She is also allergic to grass, pollen and dust, which in turn triggers her asthma. She was born with eczema, which has progressed in severity the older she has got. She has been admitted to hospital on multiples occasions for life threatening skin infections and regularly attends the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The Jones family \"Lola is resilient, brave and strong, she never gives up and never allows her conditions to stop her, until she physically cannot do things because of the pain or something is too dangerous for her to take part in. She is very active, she loves her sports (soccer, tennis, futsal and basketball) and over the last year in particular, she has often missed out because of her body. \"Sometimes she can not walk, hold a fork, get on the toilet or hold a pencil, never mind do the things she absolutely loves. This absolutely breaks our hearts as she is so clever, kind, outgoing and a lover of people and sports. When she grows up she wants to be a tennis player, footballer and then an allergy doctor.\" Emily added: \"Lola will need to travel to California approximately four times a year, for up to four years for various food challenges and treatment, as well as initial robust testing so that they can come up with her plan. \"The success rate is 99% at putting allergies into remission so that kids can live a life of food freedom. Lola's allergies are always on our minds, wherever we go and in whatever we do.\" Anyone interested can find out more info here: Continent Futsal Cup \u2013 AtopicL.

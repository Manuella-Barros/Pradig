{"id": 243325878, "title": "Aussie Sailors Sub Off US Repair Ship for Home Visit", "text": "Australian sailors learning the ropes of submarine maintenance for the nation\u2019s incoming nuclear fleet have sailed into Sydney Harbour on board a U.S. naval ship. USS Emory S Land created a spectacle of military unity as it coasted into Sydney alongside Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ships on June 28. The vessel carries the knowledge and capabilities needed for the maintenance of Australia\u2019s future submarine fleet. The U.S. ship\u2019s commander said the visit showcased the interoperability of the AUKUS defence pact allies. \u201cWith AUKUS in the last few years, it\u2019s really given a new scale to what we are doing,\u201d Commanding Officer Captain Brent Spillner said. Half of the 35 RAN crew in training made their way home for a long-awaited visit with families. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the AUKUS initiative to train Australian technicians to work on U.S. submarines,\u201d Captain Spillner said. \u201cThey showed up in January in Guam, we put them right to work and they\u2019ve been an invaluable asset to us.\u201d A growing number of RAN sailors are training with the U.S. Navy to build knowledge about nuclear submarine technology. AUKUS was created in 2021 when Australia signed a security partnership with the U.S. and UK. The alliance enables the sharing of technological military secrets and the controversial development of an Australian nuclear submarine fleet due to begin arriving from the 2040s. U.S. and UK nuclear submarines will visit Australia more frequently from 2027 as the partnership develops and skills are taught aboard ships such as USS Emory. \u201cThis deployment really emphasises the increased cooperation which has been incredibly strong over decades,\u201d Australian Fleet Deputy Commander Commodore Ray Leggatt said. USS Emory is in Australia as part of a greater Pacific deployment that has visited Darwin and Cairns en route to other allied collaborations. Described by Captain Spillner as a floating submarine base, the ship repairs and maintains submarines at sea. Submarines breach and dock beside the ship and anything that needs fixing is engineered in the vessel\u2019s sprawling workshop. The ship has everything required on board for long voyages, such as workshops, virtual shooting ranges, a barber, and even a supermarket. Sailors will have a week in Sydney before re-joining the vessel\u2019s sister ship in Guam where the remaining Australian sailors are training.", "summary": "Australian sailors learning the ropes of submarine maintenance for the nation&#8217;s incoming nuclear fleet have sailed into Sydney Harbour on board a U.S. naval ship.

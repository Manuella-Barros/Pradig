In the first quarter of this year alone, China's trade with its BRICS partners surged by more than 11 per cent year-on-year.\n\nSolidarity among BRICS nations was prominently displayed through initiatives like the Extraordinary Joint Meeting on the Middle East, which addressed critical issues such as the situation in Gaza.\n\nThis collective action underscored their commitment to safeguarding the interests of developing countries within prominent multilateral frameworks like the G20, amplifying their unified voice on pressing international matters.\n\nBRICS also champions dialogue among civilizations, as exemplified by the United Nations' designation of June 10 as the International Day for Dialogue among Civilizations.\n\nThis initiative, guided by President Xi Jinping's Global Civilization Initiative, promotes mutual learning, respect for diversity and common progress among nations.\n\nBRICS faces the imperative to elevate its role and vision. It confronts persistent Cold War mentalities and geopolitical bloc formations that undermine multilateral mechanisms like the UN Security Council.\n\nBRICS advocates for fairness, justice, and adherence to international rules in the face of politicized economic issues, stretched national security concerns, and escalating unilateral actions and technology barriers. BRICS stands for fairness and inclusivity, advocating for balanced and globally beneficial economic globalisation.\n\nThe group aims to assume greater responsibilities and make substantial contributions on the global stage. Central to their agenda is reaffirming confidence in multilateralism, defending the UN-centered international system and countering attempts to disrupt global order.\n\nImportant upcoming international events, including the UN Summit of the Future and COP30 where BRICS countries will host the G20 summit, underscore the need for strengthened coordination and collaboration to prioritise development and equitable participation in global governance.\n\nBRICS commits to fostering peace and security by promoting political settlements for global hotspots.\n\nRecognising the futility of Cold War mentalities and bloc confrontations, BRICS advocates for dialogue and consultation to resolve conflicts such as those in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nThey support comprehensive ceasefires, humanitarian aid, and the pursuit of long-term peace solutions such as the two-state solution in the Middle East and impartial international peace conferences for Ukraine.\n\nThe group reaffirms its founding principles of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation.\n\nEmphasising finance and trade cooperation, they aim to expand market opportunities, facilitate trade and investment, and enhance financial stability through mechanisms like local currency settlement.\n\nEnergy and food security are also prioritised to ensure stable global supply chains and sustainable development practices.\n\nInnovation-driven cooperation is another cornerstone of the BRICS strategy, focusing on advancements in AI, industrialisation, digital education and connectivity. Initiatives like China's AI development centre for BRICS countries illustrate their commitment to leveraging technology for mutual benefit and capacity building among member nations.\n\nPeople-to-people exchanges play a crucial role in strengthening bonds between BRICS countries, fostering cultural understanding and promoting shared values.\n\nEvents such as sports and cultural festivals, alongside initiatives in areas like media, youth, and governance cooperation, enhance mutual respect and collaboration among diverse civilizations within BRICS.\n\nBRICS is poised to shape a more equitable and prosperous global order.

A notable development is the BRICS coalition, originally comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. With its recent expansion, the BRICS framework has introduced the concept of BRICS+, aiming for deeper and more flexible economic integration. This article explores the differences between BRICS and BRICS+, and examines the potential benefits for Bangladesh should it join this influential group.\n\nBRICS was established to foster cooperation among major emerging economies. Over the years, it has become a significant player in global economic affairs, impacting international trade, investment, and policy-making. Recently, BRICS welcomed Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates, demonstrating its commitment to broader inclusion. This expansion enhances BRICS' global influence, making it a more formidable economic bloc. Currently, 15 more countries have expressed interest in joining, including Bahrain, Belarus, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Senegal, and Venezuela.\n\nBRICS+ represents an advanced stage of BRICS cooperation, focusing on integration between the regional arrangements of BRICS economies and their development institutions. This \"integration of integrations\" aims to generate multipliers across various areas of economic cooperation, such as trade, investment, anti-crisis policies, and financial cooperation. The BRICS+ framework is designed for greater flexibility, allowing more dynamic economic partnerships and regional collaborations.\n\nThe expansion of BRICS offers short-term benefits, like an enlarged platform and increased international influence. However, it also presents long-term challenges, including the need for clear criteria for new members and potential difficulties in reaching consensus among a larger group. BRICS+, with its emphasis on regional integration, promises greater economic dividends through more flexible and dynamic cooperation mechanisms.\n\nIn the investment sphere, BRICS+ can generate significant multiplier effects by enhancing the potential GDP growth rates of core BRICS economies and their regional partners through connectivity projects. These projects, financed by regional development banks and institutions like the New Development Bank (NDB), can boost long-term trade potential and foster stronger intra-regional growth impulses. Enhanced regional connectivity can lay the foundation for sustained economic growth across the Global South.\n\nBRICS+ offers substantial benefits in terms of anti-crisis stimuli. Coordinated efforts and investments through regional integration arrangements and development institutions can amplify economic stimuli, boosting demand in core BRICS economies and their regional partners. This coordinated approach can lead to a more robust and resilient economic environment, supporting sustained growth and stability.\n\nBangladesh's interest in joining BRICS aligns with its strategic objectives of diversifying economic partnerships, enhancing its role in regional and global trade, and securing a stable and sustainable growth trajectory. With robust economic growth, increasing industrialization, and a strategic geographic location, Bangladesh is a promising candidate for BRICS membership.\n\nOver the past decade, Bangladesh has achieved remarkable economic progress, maintaining an average GDP growth rate of around 6-7%. The country is emerging as a key player in the global textile industry, being the second-largest apparel exporter after China. This robust economic performance underscores Bangladesh's potential as a valuable addition to the BRICS alliance.\n\nOne of Bangladesh's strategic objectives is to diversify its economic partnerships. By joining BRICS, Bangladesh can access a wider range of economic opportunities and reduce its dependency on traditional markets in the West. This diversification is crucial for mitigating risks associated with global market fluctuations and ensuring long-term economic stability.\n\nJoining BRICS could open new avenues for investment in Bangladesh. The BRICS countries, with their significant economic resources, could provide substantial financial and technical assistance. Enhanced access to the New Development Bank (NDB) would facilitate infrastructure development projects, crucial for sustaining Bangladesh's growth momentum. Such investments can drive significant improvements in infrastructure, boosting economic productivity and competitiveness.\n\nBangladesh could benefit from technological transfers and industrial collaborations with BRICS countries, particularly in areas such as information technology, renewable energy, and manufacturing. Such partnerships could enhance Bangladesh's industrial capabilities and foster innovation, driving long-term economic growth. The exchange of technology and expertise can accelerate Bangladesh's transition to a more industrialized and technologically advanced economy.\n\nAs a member of BRICS, Bangladesh would gain a stronger voice in international forums, contributing to shaping global economic policies. This enhanced geopolitical influence would support Bangladesh's aspirations to play a more prominent role in regional and global affairs. Being part of BRICS would also enable Bangladesh to collaborate more effectively with other major emerging economies, amplifying its impact on global economic and political decisions.\n\nChina, a key player in BRICS, has expressed strong support for Bangladesh's bid to join the alliance. During a visit to Bangladesh, Liu Jianchao, Minister of the International Relations of the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s Central Committee, reaffirmed China's commitment to fostering extensive cooperation with Bangladesh. He assured that China would positively consider Bangladesh's inclusion in BRICS and support its economic growth through various means, including continued market access and assistance with the Rohingya crisis.\n\nIn April 2024, Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira visited Bangladesh and expressed Brazil's serious consideration of Bangladesh's interest in joining BRICS. He highlighted shared principles and positions between the two countries, reinforcing the potential for Bangladesh's inclusion. This diplomatic engagement underscores the growing recognition of Bangladesh's economic and strategic importance within the BRICS framework.\n\nDuring a courtesy call on Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin, Liu Jianchao emphasized China's dedication to bolstering development ties and assured support for Bangladesh's growth across various sectors. The relationship between Bangladesh and China is deeply rooted, with both nations expressing hope for a stronger development partnership in the coming years. President Shahabuddin sought China's support for Bangladesh's BRICS bid, a sentiment echoed by Foreign Minister Hasan Mahmud during meetings with Chinese officials.\n\nBangladesh's strategic objectives include diversifying its economic partnerships, enhancing its role in regional and global trade, and securing a stable and sustainable growth trajectory. Joining BRICS could facilitate new avenues for investment, technological collaboration, and enhanced geopolitical influence.\n\nBRICS membership could provide Bangladesh with access to significant financial resources for infrastructure development. The New Development Bank (NDB) and regional development banks within the BRICS framework could play a crucial role in financing projects that enhance connectivity and economic productivity. Such investments are vital for sustaining Bangladesh's growth momentum and achieving its Vision 2041 goals of becoming a high-income country.\n\nBangladesh could benefit from technological transfers and industrial collaborations with BRICS countries. Partnerships in information technology, renewable energy, and manufacturing could drive innovation and industrial growth in Bangladesh. Access to advanced technologies and expertise from BRICS nations can accelerate Bangladesh's transition to a more industrialized and technologically advanced economy.\n\nAs a BRICS member, Bangladesh would gain a stronger voice in international forums, contributing to shaping global economic policies. Enhanced geopolitical influence would support Bangladesh's aspirations to play a more prominent role in regional and global affairs. This would enable Bangladesh to collaborate more effectively with other major emerging economies, amplifying its impact on global economic and political decisions.\n\nThe distinction between BRICS and BRICS+ lies in their approach to economic integration and cooperation. While BRICS focuses on strengthening ties among its member states, BRICS+ aims to create a more flexible and dynamic framework for regional and global economic partnerships. For Bangladesh, joining BRICS offers numerous benefits, including access to investment, technological transfers, and enhanced geopolitical influence. As the country strives to diversify its economic partnerships and achieve sustainable growth, membership in BRICS could be a transformative step towards realizing its strategic objectives and securing a prominent position in the global economic arena.\n\nBangladesh's quest to join BRICS, with China's backing, is a significant step towards becoming a high-income nation by 2041. The multifaceted partnership between Bangladesh and China, encompassing infrastructure, technology, trade, and cultural exchange, provides a solid foundation for this ambitious goal. As Bangladesh continues to make strides in economic development and industrialization, support and collaboration from global players like China and potential inclusion in BRICS will be pivotal in shaping its future on the global stage.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyblitz.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blitz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tajul_islam@weeklyblitz.net", "name": "Tajul Islam", "type":

In an interview with Hindustan Times, Reshetnikov delved into key areas such as trade, investment, technology transfer, and tourism. The minister also shed light on new opportunities within the BRICS framework and the alliance's primary objectives for the coming years, including its much-discussed dedollarisation efforts. Edited excerpts:\n\nApart from tourism, how do you see the economic partnership between India and Russia evolving, particularly in areas like trade, investment, and technology transfer?\n\nIndia is one of our key partners. Mutual trade volumes have increased five times in the last five years. In 2023, India moved up to second place, reaching an 8 per cent share of Russia's total foreign trade. Our cooperation develops smoothly in line with agreements between Mr. Vladimir Putin and Mr. Narendra Modi, and we expect Modi's upcoming visit to further strengthen bilateral ties and explore new areas of mutual interest.\n\nRussian exports to India include agricultural and food processing equipment, aviation, and IT products. Indian mining companies buy our excavators and draglines, and our equipment is actively used in track construction and servicing. We anticipate that passenger transportation in India will soon use Russian-designed rolling stock.\n\nIndia's fast-growing economy provides a foundation for deepening and diversifying cooperation. In 2023, imports from India grew steadily, with significant increases in machinery, vehicles, chemical products, metals, and food products exceeding $1 billion.\n\nTherefore, significant opportunities exist for expanding Russian exports to India, particularly in chemical products, fertilisers, energy, railway engineering, metallurgical equipment, timber products, and agricultural goods. Growth in bilateral trade can be facilitated by increased investment activity and a broader range of products.\n\nCurrently, discussions are underway for a new investment agreement. Alternatively, we have proposed negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement covering trade in services and investment protection. Such an agreement could enhance trade and facilitate investment-related discussions, aiming for higher protection of bilateral investments.\n\nWhat new opportunities do you anticipate for both countries within the BRICS framework?\n\nBRICS cooperation offers dual leverage for Russia and India. It allows both countries to align their trade and economic approaches, with 200 meetings under Russia's chairmanship this year, including traditional Trade Ministers Meetings and sessions on economic and trade issues. These platforms enable open discussions on key matters like supply chain stability, seamless business operations, and sustainable growth.\n\nOn the other hand, BRICS could be considered as a horn of the two countries' voice. I mean, both Russia and India may expect to scale up their bilateral initiatives within BRICS, thus, granting them international attention. India has strongly supported several Russian initiatives, such as enhancing e-commerce, protecting consumer from fraudulent commercial practices, and exploring digital solutions for internal and cross border B2C and B2B disputes. So, this mutual understanding may turn these aspirations into multilateral outcomes.\n\nWhat are the primary objectives and priorities for BRICS in the coming years? Can you elaborate on the de-dollarisation efforts within BRICS?\n\nThe key goals of BRICS are outlined in the Strategy for BRICS Economic Partnership 2025, which focuses on trade and investment, innovation and digitalisation, and sustainable and inclusive growth. Despite being drafted before the Covid-19 pandemic, the strategy remains relevant and addresses BRICS heritage and economic trends.\n\nThis year, BRICS aims to enhance World Trade Organization (WTO) efficiency, implement environmental trade measures, facilitate agricultural trade, and streamline joint supply and production chains. These long-standing issues aim to simplify trade rules, boost competitiveness, expand export potential, and improve citizens' welfare.\n\nWe also seek to capitalise on digital transformation opportunities, including protecting consumer rights in e-commerce, exploring pre-trial dispute resolution mechanisms, and ensuring BRICS marketplace accessibility for national Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Another focus is leveraging AI for trade and investment cooperation and connecting BRICS special economic zones - an absolutely new initiative to the grouping -- to aid industry localisation.\n\nAs for the second part of your question, it is indeed on the agenda - namely, how to develop an independent financial infrastructure that would facilitate cross-border economic activity not only within BRICS, but also with other partners, such as Africa within the framework of BRICS+.\n\nThis includes removing barriers to mutual payments in national currencies, creating hedging instruments, developing a multilateral digital settlement and payment platform, and expanding the correspondent banks network. So, we expect gradual progress in these areas.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Technology transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bilateral trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_Reshetnikov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maxim Reshetnikov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lumber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metallurgy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/08/1600x900/Maxim-Reshetnikov-said-BRICS-cooperation-offers-du_1720440923876.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714835", "eventUri": "eng-9714835", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

the BRICS members' parliaments to strengthen cooperation in order to define new procedures for monetary transactions among the member states and enhance the trade corridors for the transfer of commodities and services, the Iranian speaker noted.\n\n\"Four main topics, including transportation, energy, trade and banking are the most important themes for cooperation among the BRICS members,\" Qalibaf stated, expressing the Iranian Parliament's readiness to work with the BRICS partners on all of those issues.\n\nThe parliaments of BRICS members can also adopt laws facilitating the promotion of trade in order to counter unilateralism and remove the obstacles to trade interaction, he added.\n\nThe Iranian lawmaker also proposed that the BRICS Parliamentary Forum should consider plans to counter economic sanctions and unilateral coercive measures as major threats to the security and welfare of ordinary people in the BRICS member states.\n\nThe theme of the ongoing forum in St.

Why?\n\nIt's all about supply chains and payment chains. The US must rebuild supply chains to remain self-sufficient in certain commodities or it must trade with the BRICS on the BRICS terms. And that means with Gold in hand\n\nThe BRICS, in turn, must build payment chains (and value-added portions of supply chains) to replace the SWIFT system. Either that or they must then remain dependent on the US. And that means with the USD in hand\n\nThe alternative to ignoring these choices between economic self-sufficiency and a Gold standard for continued international trade is: isolation, misallocation and misuse of resources, and finally escalation of war.\n\nWhat follows is a description of the situation, a contextual overview of the BRICS plan, and how the G7 must continue to respond over the next 5 years.\n\nThe BRICS are in the process of creating a settlement medium (currency, medium of exchange) for international trade comprised of Gold and other assets deemed separable from Dollar influence.\n\nDelivery and receipt of this Settlement Medium concurrent with the reciprocal goods ( the goods bought with the Settlement medium) exchanged for said Medium will make final all transactions negotiated.\n\nThe currency will make use of Blockchain. In doing so this will serve as an immutable contract between negotiating parties. In combination with other precautionary measures,1 it will give reasonable assurances against fraudulent representations as to what the currency has actually backing it.\n\nThe combination of UNIT type prorata measurements, Blockchain type security, and Current Accounting economics it is believed will serve to solidify the nascent currency's denomination, reliabililty, and value.\n\nIt is believed the West's G7 Central Banks will need to have BRICS currency exposure in their reserve to better hedge their own economic risks. Failing literally to have that BRICS currency, the G7 CBs and sovereign wealth funds will simply continue to accumulate the assets (Gold, Silver etc) deemed important (or hard to get on demand like Gold and Silver) within the Store of Value basket the BRICS created. in other words, they will simply reverse engineer the basket and buy the parts needed.\n\nThe G7 CBs can then trade by creating their own mirror basket of Eastern Currencies, bonds, and Gold in what will likely be an IMF/SDR type of basket for risk purposes if ever needed.\n\nFor over a decade, discussions have simmered about moving away from the U.S. dollar. Recently, these ideas have taken a more concrete shape, driven by the BRICS nations, which are positioning themselves as a counterbalance to Western influence.\n\nBRICS is advancing a three-step plan to establish a new international currency. This includes:\n\nThis initiative aims to reshape the global economy, challenging the dominance of the U.S. dollar established since the Bretton Woods Conference.\n\nThe BRICS nations have been increasing their gold reserves, now totaling 6.3 thousand tons. As the world's largest gold buyers since 2022, their actions signal a clear intention to develop a new global currency\n\nTo achieve financial independence from Western systems, BRICS is developing its own payment systems and strengthening digital currencies. Russia's Ministry of Finance is working on a platform to facilitate money transfers between BRICS countries, aiming to reduce the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nRussia is also progressing with its digital ruble, launched in a pilot project in August 2023.

Why?\n\nIt's all about supply chains and payment chains. The US must rebuild supply chains to remain self-sufficient in certain commodities or it must trade with the BRICS on the BRICS terms. And that means with Gold in hand\n\nThe BRICS, in turn, must build payment chains (and value-added portions of supply chains) to replace the SWIFT system. Either that or they must then remain dependent on the US. And that means with the USD in hand\n\nThe alternative to ignoring these choices between economic self-sufficiency and a Gold standard for continued international trade is: isolation, misallocation and misuse of resources, and finally escalation of war.\n\nWhat follows is a description of the situation, a contextual overview of the BRICS plan, and how the G7 must continue to respond over the next 5 years.\n\n1- The Currency:\n\nThe BRICS are in the process of creating a settlement medium (currency, medium of exchange) for international trade comprised of Gold and other assets deemed separable from Dollar influence.\n\nDelivery and receipt of this Settlement Medium concurrent with the reciprocal goods ( the goods bought with the Settlement medium) exchanged for said Medium will make final all transactions negotiated.\n\n2- The Unit and Technology:\n\nThe currency will make use of Blockchain. In doing so this will serve as an immutable contract between negotiating parties. In combination with other precautionary measures,1 it will give reasonable assurances against fraudulent representations as to what the currency has actually backing it.\n\nThe combination of UNIT type prorata measurements, Blockchain type security, and Current Accounting economics it is believed will serve to solidify the nascent currency's denomination, reliabililty, and value.\n\n4- The G7 Problem, Solved With Gold & Silver:\n\nIt is believed the West's G7 Central Banks will need to have BRICS currency exposure in their reserve to better hedge their own economic risks. Failing literally to have that BRICS currency, the G7 CBs and sovereign wealth funds will simply continue to accumulate the assets (Gold, Silver etc) deemed important (or hard to get on demand like Gold and Silver) within the Store of Value basket the BRICS created. in other words, they will simply reverse engineer the basket and buy the parts needed.\n\nThe G7 CBs can then trade by creating their own mirror basket of Eastern Currencies, bonds, and Gold in what will likely be an IMF/SDR type of basket for risk purposes if ever needed.\n\n6- The BRICS Challenge to Dollar Hegemony\n\nFor over a decade, discussions have simmered about moving away from the U.S. dollar. Recently, these ideas have taken a more concrete shape, driven by the BRICS nations, which are positioning themselves as a counterbalance to Western influence.\n\n7- The Three Phase Plan\n\nBRICS is advancing a three-step plan to establish a new international currency. This includes:\n\nThis initiative aims to reshape the global economy, challenging the dominance of the U.S. dollar established since the Bretton Woods Conference.\n\nThe BRICS nations have been increasing their gold reserves, now totaling 6.3 thousand tons. As the world's largest gold buyers since 2022, their actions signal a clear intention to develop a new global currency\n\n8- The End of Dollar Dependency\n\nTo achieve financial independence from Western systems, BRICS is developing its own payment systems and strengthening digital currencies. Russia's Ministry of Finance is working on a platform to facilitate money transfers between BRICS countries, aiming to reduce the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nRussia is also progressing with its digital ruble, launched in a pilot project in August 2023. This digital currency is now accepted in 11 Russian cities, with plans for further expansion.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWIFT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SWIFT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockchain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autarky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_of_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medium of exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bretton Woods Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special drawing rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local_Currency_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local Currency Systems", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/contributor-teasers/2024/07/Image%20-%20no%20preview%20-%20square%2879%29.jpg?h=b6d33c97&itok=DhVuGvOW", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714835", "eventUri": "eng-9714835", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Media and observers paid close attention to the G7 and Ukraine peace summits. But in the same week, a pivotal, under-the-radar meeting took place in western Russia, as BRICS foreign ministers gathered with their counterparts from nearly two dozen Global South countries. Like the G7 and Ukraine summits, the BRICS meeting didn't result in revelatory policy initiatives. However, it showed that more and more nations are aggrieved by U.S. policy, looking for alternatives to Washington's leadership and want to be part of the de-dollarization trend.\n\nBrazil, Russia, India, and China began the BRICS project in 2006, seeking to reform international finance institutions like the IMF and World Bank. South Africa later joined in 2010. The group formed the New Development Bank in 2014 but never gathered momentum or coherence until recently.\n\nEarly this year, important regional powers Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) officially joined the group. Before the June meeting, Moscow's ambassador to China said that \"the number of states interested in BRICS is much bigger than this entity can absorb now,\" with nearly 30 countries hoping to receive an invitation. Countries like Turkey, a NATO member that has long sought admission to the European Union, and Thailand, which has historically been content to sit on the geopolitical sidelines, now want to join BRICS.\n\nOne doesn't need a crystal ball to divine their motivations. The top diplomats from BRICS and the Global South spoke of the need to build new security, governance, and finance architectures to supplant the current U.S.-led systems that they believe only serve Western interests. BRICS features Global South countries' concerns and grievances front and center -- this rarely happens in Western-led international fora. In fact, anti-Western grievances are the political valence that brings together BRICS members and Global South countries.\n\nBRICS states account for more than 40 percent of the world's population, 28 percent of the world's economic output, and 47 percent of global crude oil. An enlarged BRICS with more oil producers and regional powers should be particularly concerning for the U.S., as it could advance de-dollarization.\n\nOne way in which the group is subverting the dollar's dominance is by encouraging \"enhanced use of local currencies in trade and financial transactions between\" BRICS countries, said a joint statement from their June meeting. China has been at the forefront of this effort as it seeks to internationalize its currency. Since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, China has ramped up its use of the yuan to buy Russian commodities, particularly oil, and the renminbi has overtaken the U.S. dollar as the primary currency for Chinese-Russian trade. China has been in talks with other major oil producers like Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia to move toward more extensive use of the yuan to settle oil transactions.\n\nIn 2023, an estimated 20 percent of global oil was bought and sold in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Countries like Iran and Russia, under heavy U.S. sanctions, are not the only ones looking to diversify. Even Brazil, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia are moving to protect themselves from the impact of Western sanctions on oil and other commodity trade. To further move away from the dollar, China is selling off its U.S. dollar assets, and China and Russia have bought record levels of gold in recent years.\n\nThis effort to undermine the dollar will have serious ramifications for the U.S. and its economy, particularly in this inflationary era. Since the 1970s, the U.S. dollar has been the primary currency -- known as the petrodollar -- for oil transactions. This drives demand for the dollar and helps it maintain its value and role as the world's global reserve currency. As a result, the U.S. generally has lower borrowing costs, can run deficits, and print money at its discretion, propping up Americans' standard of living.\n\nBut U.S. policies, particularly sanctions policy, are undermining the dollar, and by extension, the U.S. economy and Washington's global standing. U.S. sanctions cover 29 percent of the global economy and 40 percent of global oil reserves. Washington's reflexive and extensive deployment of sanctions has been an abject failure in the aggregate. The U.S. frequently deploys this tool to coerce states to change their behavior, but it rarely works -- just look at Cuba.\n\nNot only are these sanctions not having their intended effect, but they are \"inadvertently creat[ing] an 'Axis of Evasion'\" among Russia, Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, and China, who are banding together to mitigate their limited access to Western markets.\n\nFor so long, the U.S. has considered itself \"the indispensable nation.\" However, many nations in today's multipolar world see U.S. hegemony upheld by hectoring and hypocrisy. They perceive hypocrisy in Washington's irreconcilable stances on the wars in Gaza and Ukraine and sense that the rules-based order only applies to the West's adversaries.\n\nReports of the dollar's imminent demise are surely overblown. A unified BRICS currency will not come to fruition anytime soon. Still, the de-dollarization trend and what it signifies about perceptions of the U.S. should lead Washington to take stock of what is driving BRICS and Global South nations together to replace the dollar. The U.S. must reconsider its unyielding commitment to primacy, its knee-jerk use of sanctions, and its hypocritical stance on the \"rules-based order\" before it is too late. Restraint is needed as vast swathes of the world are coming together to sidestep the U.S. dollar and supplant U.S. leadership.\n\nAdam Gallagher is a foreign policy analyst and writer covering U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and geopolitics.

Despite all of T\u00fcrkiye's cooperation and efforts, the European Union did not grant T\u00fcrkiye the right to become a member. After waiting patiently for years, T\u00fcrkiye has now turned its attention to the BRICS financial union, seeking a new financial union that will protect its economic interests.\n\nThe BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) alliance offers a new perspective to T\u00fcrkiye. Despite its NATO membership, T\u00fcrkiye initially refrained from joining BRICS and becoming a founding member. However, economic pressures such as the depreciation of the Turkish lira and rising inflation forced T\u00fcrkiye to reconsider its stance. While the Turkish economy develops with tourism, industrial activities and exports, high inflation continues to occur in T\u00fcrkiye; this points to external factors, especially dollar controls.\n\nConsidering the complexity and potential benefits of T\u00fcrkiye's participation in BRICS, a balanced and strategic approach is required: steps should be taken to utilize the increasing trade and investment potential with BRICS countries, taking into account the opportunities in the global trade market and focusing on the main areas of partnership and foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nTo analyze the risks of economic fluctuations in BRICS countries and to prepare strategies to deal with these risks.\n\nBRICS membership should be achieved through a balanced foreign policy that does not affect basic relations with Western allies and presents T\u00fcrkiye as a bridge between East and West. A balanced policy is a guarantee of T\u00fcrkiye's best economic and economic interests.\n\nIncreasing T\u00fcrkiye's autonomy and advancing its national interests more effectively at the international level through BRICS membership is a primary goal and strategic approach. By diversifying its economy, T\u00fcrkiye aims to reduce dependence on the single market by investing in various sectors, such as technology, manufacturing and renewable energy, with a strong focus on local talent.\n\nTo facilitate smooth business operations with BRICS countries, improving and simplifying the regulatory framework is essential. Adapting the Turkish regulatory framework to international best practices will align it with global standards and foster a more conducive environment for international trade and investment.\n\nPolitical stability and the alignment of national interests are crucial for this strategy. Building consensus among internal stakeholders, including political groups and businesses, is necessary to highlight the benefits and address the challenges of BRICS membership. Ensuring policy transparency will help in garnering support and understanding from all sectors.\n\nA positive and active diplomatic strategy is vital. T\u00fcrkiye should secure financing for critical infrastructure and development projects by actively participating in institutions such as the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB). Strengthening bilateral ties with BRICS countries will maximize strategic and economic benefits. Additionally, to maintain balance and avoid conflicts, it is important to clarify strategic goals with Western allies and maintain an ongoing strategic dialogue.\n\nPromoting innovation and technological development by collaborating on research and development projects with BRICS countries is essential for T\u00fcrkiye's sustainable development policy. Prioritizing the green economy and long-term economic and environmental improvement initiatives will further enhance T\u00fcrkiye's growth and sustainability.\n\nPositioning T\u00fcrkiye as a regional leader by leveraging its unique geopolitical position and various alliances is a strategic objective. Using BRICS as a platform to discuss global issues - such as fair trade practices, climate change and global security - that align with T\u00fcrkiye's national and international interests is key to maximizing its influence and impact.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's potential membership in BRICS presents significant opportunities and challenges. By adopting a balanced approach that combines economic flexibility, strategic diplomacy and sustainable development, T\u00fcrkiye can derive maximum benefits from BRICS membership. This approach will help protect its national interests, maintain strong relations with Western allies, and preserve its core strategic objectives.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType":

and reiterated that the de-dollarization and use of the alternative currencies will cease the US pressure on the emerging economies to a great extent.\n\nThe participation of new countries and the growing trend of countries' willingness to join this multilateral international organization indicate its importance in international relations and stabilization of its position in the international arena, the Iranian parliament speaker highlighted.\n\nThe current global system has not so far been able to take fruitful measures in the field of resolving regional and international disputes, conflicts, and inequalities, according to which, the new collective economic and political capacities are being formed within the framework of multilateral organizations, he continued.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has always emphasized the need to pay attention to a multilateral system, he said, adding that the Iranian government and parliament want fruitful cooperation and cooperation between BRICS member states and the practical realization of its objectives, Ghalibaf added.\n\nElsewhere in his remarks, Ghalibaf pointed to the four main pivots of \"transit, energy, trade, and banking\" as the most important pillars of cooperation between the BRICS members and stated that the Iranian Parliament and the new government are fully prepared to cooperate with their partners in all these areas.\n\nThe parliaments of the member countries play a vital and important role in the success of BRICS, and these countries can establish facilitation laws for the development of trade and remove legal obstacles to the expansion of trade cooperation to get out of unilateralism.\n\nMohammad Bagher Ghalibaf left Tehran for St. Petersburg, Russia on Wednesday afternoon to participate in the BRICS Parliamentary forum with the theme of the role of Parliaments in strengthening multilateralism for just global development and Security.\n\nThis is the first attendance of a high-ranking Iranian official at BRICS public meetings after Iran's accession to the group.\n\nPursuing the use of BRICS capabilities for financial and commercial transactions is one of the most important goals of the Iranian high parliamentary delegation's visit to St. Petersburg.\n\nThe 10th BRICS Parliamentary Forum is underway at Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg and will run through July 12,

that the BRICS, which now includes Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates all have relatively weak, non-convertible currencies ( not accepted for most international trade) and most of which have steadily lost value against the dollar over the past five years.\n\nThis makes it difficult to price international trade in these currencies because of currency value fluctuation.\n\nThe Saudi and UAE currencies have maintained their value against the dollar, but this is because they are pegged to the dollar and backed by dollars.\n\nThis means that neither could displace the dollar as the global trade currency since both derive their value from the dollar.\n\nThe only international currency in the grouping is the Chinese yuan which is also partially pegged to the dollar and suffers from the same problems of non-convertibility and weak exchange rate to the USD.\n\nAdditionally, none of the central banks of BRICS countries are willing to hold large amounts of BRICS currencies as reserves and they are largely useless for international trade with other countries.\n\nTo solve this problem, BRICS has decided to implement a currency swap arrangement.\n\nA currency swap is a financial agreement between two countries to exchange a set amount of one currency for an equivalent amount of another currency, based on a pre-determined exchange rate.", "source":

Today, we note the high interest of different countries in interaction with Russia, which is chairing the BRICS group in 2024. It is on the basis of national and cultural diversity that completely new ideas, interesting programmes, and unique educational formats are born, which will be in demand throughout the BRICS+ information environment in the future. The modern technological world offers many opportunities for cooperation despite the geographical remoteness of countries and peoples. But even more people are brought closer together by common spiritual values and creative goals, which are at the very core of TV BRICS' activities\"\n\nShe added that the international media network works with representatives of creative industries in many formats. Projects with partner media, artists, and cultural and educational institutions are constantly being implemented. By sharing content with national media, TV BRICS creates a vivid and comprehensive picture of the world for the audience and shares the cultural codes of the BRICS countries with the people of different countries. The TV BRICS network adapts content into five languages, namely Russian, English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese, and transmits it to more than 70 international partners.\n\nThe representative of Russian-Iranian Center for Legal and Economic Cooperation, Abbas Mirzai Ghazi, explained that creative industries play a special role in Iran, so a special headquarters was established to develop this sphere. The supervisory board of this body consists of eight ministries and several state organisations.\n\n\"Today, there are 108 creative industries in the republic, 58 of which are located in Tehran and the rest are distributed across the country and are active,\" Abbas Mirzai Ghazi, revealed. He added that the first Russian Creative Industries House is planned to be established in Iran.\n\nMNA/\n\nSource: TV BRICS", "source": {"uri": "en.mehrnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mehr News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creative industries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamar_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bamar people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_diversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural diversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Volunteering", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Volunteering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.mehrnews.com/d/2024/07/09/4/5071722.jpg?ts=1720527202065", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714835", "eventUri": "eng-9714835", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

This potential membership represents a significant shift in Turkey's international standing.\n\nAtilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst at GlobalSource Partners, explains: \"One of the core principles of BRICS is to reduce the role of the dollar in mutual trade, which is in Turkey's interests.\" He argues that BRICS membership complements Turkey's broader foreign policy goals, saying: \"The concept of a new platform that fosters trade between geographically distant countries naturally appeals to Turkey and fits its foreign policy stance.\"\n\nYesilada believes that Turkey's BRICS bid has an additional purpose: \"It signals to Putin that Turkey intends to maintain and strengthen its growing trade ties with Russia.\" This comes despite Putin's recent warnings against Turkey over its efforts to improve relations with its traditional Western allies.\n\nThe Russian president strongly supports Turkey's BRICS membership bid. Ceren Ergenc, a China expert at the Center for European Policy Studies, believes that Moscow views Turkey's possible BRICS membership as a strategic move aimed at counterbalancing Beijing's growing influence within the group.\n\nTurkey and BRICS\n\nPutin strongly supports Turkey's BRICS membership bid. Ceren Ergenc, a China expert at the Center for European Policy Studies, believes that this support is part of Moscow's strategy to counterbalance Beijing's growing influence within the BRICS.\n\nErgenc explains: \"BRICS has become China's domain, with recent invitations to join mainly going to countries with which China seeks closer ties, thereby marginalizing Russia and India as the other major powers in the group.\"\n\nTurkey's push for BRICS membership coincides with its impasse in its EU accession process, hampered by Turkey's failure to meet the Copenhagen criteria on human rights. This impasse would affect Turkey's trade relations with the EU. Turkey analyst Atilla Yesilada notes that \"Erdogan's frustration with the EU's lack of progress on Turkey's accession and the customs union update has contributed to the BRICS bid.\"\n\nHowever, Yesilada argues that Turkey's interest in BRICS goes beyond Erdogan's presidency and reflects a broader foreign policy strategy. He says: \"It fits with Turkey's overall political objective, widely supported by the country's political establishment, to maintain its independence from any political bloc, whether Western or Eastern.\"\n\nAs Erdogan prepares to attend the NATO summit in Washington, where he is expected to reaffirm Turkey's commitments to Western security, analysts see the BRICS bid as a clear indication that Ankara is diversifying its international partnerships beyond its traditional Western allies.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

They also reiterated their commitment to assuring a greater participation of developing and least developed countries, especially those in Africa, in the global decision-making process.\n\nThe coming together of BRICS into the multilateral front will further open a window of opportunity for developing and least developed countries to access finance that has no strings attached to it. The New Development Bank (NDB) has started to positively impact development among countries including China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the like. Critical public infrastructure is being expanded in the stated countries, ranging from connectivity and clean energy to water and sanitation.\n\nWhile reaffirming their commitment to the BRICS spirit featuring mutual respect and understanding, equality, solidarity, openness, inclusiveness and consensus, diplomats in Nizhny Novgorod during the meeting in June also emphasized the central role of the United Nations in the international system. Diplomats participating in the meeting, including Ethiopia's Foreign Affairs Minister Taye Atskesilassie, emphasized the importance of revamping the United Nations, international financial, and security institutions while keeping developing countries' interests in mind.\n\n\"The Ministers voiced their support for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including its Security Council, with a view to making it more democratic, representative, effective and efficient, and to increase the representation of developing countries in the Council's memberships so that it can adequately respond to prevailing global challenges and support the legitimate aspirations of emerging and developing countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including BRICS countries, to play a greater role in international affairs,\" said a joint statement of BRICS foreign ministers released following the meeting.\n\nThe prestigious body, the UN, has matured to the age of 79 but has not yet opened its most important organ, the United Nations Security Council, to equal representation. In the UNSC seat where the decision of the organ must be obeyed by all member countries, regions such as Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean have remained onlookers even on their own affairs. The 54 African countries and 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries adhere to the decisions of the UNSC that they have never participated as permanent members.\n\nFor a long, leaders of African countries, including Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed brought the issue to the attention of African leaders. For instance, on May 25, 2023, as the African Union turned digits to 60 years old, the prime minister made his point on the fact that the continent that more than a billion people call it home must secure its permanent seat in the UNSC.\n\nNow that the BRICS sphere of influence is gaining traction across the length and breadth of our world, contributing to a more fair, balanced and democratic global order and bringing peace and security in an increasingly volatile world, the push for reforming the UN system has become inevitable. The bloc, entirely composed of developing countries, understands the true feeling of getting kept at the sidelines on pressing matters that affect millions of lives. For instance, about 36 percent of the UN peacekeeping missions have been mandated in Africa since the 1960s.\n\nIt is illogical, to say the least, to stay stubborn at a time when member states of the UN themselves are raising their voices to create a UN system that lives up to the 21st Century demands of the nations. The BRICS expansion, incorporating more members from Africa such as Egypt and Ethiopia, in particular, helps amplify the plea. The countries have already started to speak in unison to create an international system that is fair and balanced, and one which prevails justice for all.\n\nAfrica endured centuries of injustices, from the trans-African slave trade 15th C-19th to 19th century colonialism to the current marginalization at the UNSC in the 21st C.

This potential membership represents a significant shift in Turkey's international alignments.\n\nAtilla Yesilada, a Turkey analyst at GlobalSource Partners, explains, \"A core principle of BRICS is reducing the dollar's role in mutual trade, which aligns with Turkey's interests.\" He argues that BRICS membership complements Turkey's broader foreign policy objectives, stating, \"The concept of a new platform fostering trade among geographically distant countries naturally appeals to Turkey and fits its foreign policy stance.\"\n\nYesilada suggests that Turkey's BRICS bid serves an additional purpose: \"It signals to Putin that Turkey intends to maintain and strengthen its growing commercial ties with Russia.\" This comes despite Putin's recent cautions to Turkey regarding its efforts to improve relations with its traditional Western allies.\n\nThe Russian leader strongly supports Turkey's BRICS membership bid. Ceren Ergenc, a China specialist at the Centre for European Policy Studies, posits that Moscow views Turkey's potential BRICS membership as a strategic move to balance Beijing's increasing influence within the group.\n\nTurikey and BRICS\n\nPutin strongly supports Turkey's BRICS membership bid. Ceren Ergenc, a China specialist at the Centre for European Policy Studies, suggests this support is part of Moscow's strategy to counterbalance Beijing's growing influence within BRICS.\n\nErgenc explains, \"BRICS has become China's domain, with recent membership invitations primarily extended to countries China seeks closer ties with, effectively sidelining Russia and India as the group's other major powers.\"\n\nTurkey's pursuit of BRICS membership coincides with its stalled EU accession process, hampered by Turkey's non-compliance with the EU's Copenhagen Criteria on human rights. This impasse is reportedly affecting Turkey's trade relations with the EU. Atilla Yesilada, a Turkey analyst, notes, \"Erdogan's frustration with the EU's lack of progress on Turkey's accession and customs union update contributed to the BRICS bid.\"\n\nHowever, Yesilada argues that Turkey's interest in BRICS transcends Erdogan's presidency, reflecting a broader foreign policy strategy. He states, \"This aligns with Turkey's overarching policy goal, widely supported by the country's policy establishment, of maintaining independence from any single political bloc, be it Western or Eastern.\"\n\nAs Erdogan prepares to attend the NATO summit in Washington, where he's expected to reaffirm Turkey's Western security commitments, analysts view the BRICS bid as a clear indication that Ankara is diversifying its international partnerships beyond its traditional Western allies.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Read more \"The membership of NAM includes nations that have had issues with the US, such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Iran. Despite this, firms from the US proceeded to invest vast amounts of money in Malaysia's electronics sector from the 1970s,\" he said.\n\n\"Investment from the US into Malaysia has continued unabated even after Malaysia joined the Belt and Road Initiative in 2015 and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2017. These initiatives can be taken to be more directly under the influence of China, given that country's leadership role in both initiatives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Yet, this also did not affect relations between Malaysia and the US. Thus, Malaysia's potential membership of BRICS, which has a rather disparate membership, is unlikely to raise concerns.\"\n\nHutchinson said Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim may be floating the potential membership of BRICS as a way to bolster Malaysia's image as a non-aligned nation, which would also boost the perceived autonomy of his administration \"without too much downside\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also said Malaysia's potential inclusion in BRICS would have little impact on cooperation with the US and its allies in the region, adding that the war in Gaza - and how Putrajaya navigates through the wider impact of the crisis - would be much more consequential.\n\nHutchinson observed that a boycott of US firms by some Malaysians has grown to involve discussions about US investment firm BlackRock, a key global asset manager with a large investment portfolio of firms operating in Malaysia.\n\nSeveral quarters have been urging Putrajaya to scrap a plan to privatise Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) due to one of the proposed shareholders' ties with BlackRock, which has been accused of \"profiteering from genocide\" through its stakes in US defence firms that allegedly manufacture weapons used by Israel.\n\n\"The Anwar administration has taken a firm line, supporting not just Palestinians, but also Hamas,\" said Hutchinson.\n\n\"This firm line, coupled with popular support for Gaza, has now had an economic impact in Malaysia with boycotts of companies perceived to have a link with the US such as KFC and Starbucks.\n\n\"How the Anwar administration handles this issue, as well as its relationship with US firms, is much more important for its economy.\"\n\nResponding to questions on how Malaysia's inclusion in BRICS would affect its relationship with the US, a State Department spokesman told FMT the US believes all countries have the right to choose the groupings with which they want to associate.\n\nThe spokesman said the US firmly believes that all multilateral groupings, including BRICS, should further UN Charter principles such as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as further the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\"We are focused on working to tackle global challenges across a range of multilateral institutions like the G20, OECD, and Apec, including with some of the existing BRICS+ members,\" he said.\n\nBRICS, founded in 2009, comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The alliance now encompasses almost 46% of the world's population and 36% of global GDP following the admission of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE into the grouping at the beginning of the year.\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

The dialogue within the recent international seminar was held in the Russian nuclear capital - Obninsk.\n\nMore and more countries on the African continent are interested in cooperation within the BRICS. The only African country in the Union was South Africa recently, but Egypt and Ethiopia joined the list in January 2024 turning BRICS into BRICS+.\n\nAfrica plays an important role in BRICS's global strategy, and its engagement in the association continues to gain momentum. It is now imperative to define the configuration of future relations between BRICS and Africa and to present a strategic view on how BRICS-Africa relations should develop in the long term.\n\nOne of the key topics of cooperation is the development of energy sector labour market. Official delegations from South Africa, Russia, the UAE, Brazil, China and Egypt met to exchange ideas within the international seminar on human resource development. The event took place in Obninsk, the first science city in Russia and the place, where national nuclear power was discovered in 1954. The seminar was organised with the support of the Russian Ministry of Energy and Rosatom.\n\n\"It is obvious that the BRICS countries have different energy balances and different access levels to energy resources. At this point, the staff training needs for the energy industry are different in each country. At the same time, the BRICS countries have many similar goals and difficulties in the labour market development and staff training areas, and this opens up the potential of our cooperation extension. I am confident that together we can achieve significant success in any direction,\" Deputy Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation Anastasia Bondarenko noted.\n\nProject Manager of the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) Nelisiwe Nhlapo stated that the BRICS countries are world leaders in the workers quantity in all energy sectors. They are 50% of all employees in the renewable energy sector (RES) and 80% of employees in the coal sector. At the same time, the main challenges that the BRICS countries face today are the aging of working staff in the traditional energy sector, difficulties in transferring experience to the younger generation, the need to develop specialised skills among young people. It is of great significance to unite countries in the scientific research, standardizing qualifications, and disseminating exchange programmes for students and teachers, creating mutual programmes in energy education.\n\nBRICS delegations also presented their national strategies for skills development in the energy sector. The South African delegation dwelled on the experience of the sectoral education system: more than 20 educational institutions of various industrial sectors have been created in the country in order to develop specific hard and soft skills.\n\nThe UAE delegation outlined the main areas of education that are in demand in the context of the energy transition. This includes expertise in renewable energy, energy efficiency, engineering and design, digital skills, project management, regulatory frameworks, research and development, public education, and specialized technical skills.\n\nThe Egyptian delegation presented the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources experience programmes for mid-level and senior managers in the energy sector, a leadership development programme and an energy efficiency training programme.\n\nGulnara Bikkulova, Deputy General Director of the International Initiatives and Partnerships Block of the Rosatom Corporate Academy, shared the experience of the Russian nuclear industry. She gave a snapshot of the Russian energy sector with 2.6 million working staff. The average age of employees is 42 years, women account for 26% of total personnel. Rosatom is doing a lot of work within the human resources development ecosystem to improve these indicators. Inter alia, company involves the youth into the industry by cooperating with 250 Rosatom schools and 21 partner universities. The special attention is paid to issues of gender balance: The Corporate Academy has launched the Invisible Force women's leadership programme and is assisting schools in teaching technical disciplines to female students.\n\nBRICS cooperation provides tangible benefits for Africa in the fields of research and innovation, energy, health, and education cooperation. As Africa moves towards a low-carbon development path that is inclusive and sustainable, BRICS membership will give the country access to policy and technical expertise of partner economies to accelerate Africa's industrialisation and meet Fourth Industrial Revolution aspirations.\n\nObninsk is the first science city in Russia and a large scientific and technical cluster. The world's first nuclear power plant (Obninsk NPP) was launched here on June 26, 1954, and gave rise to the era of peaceful use of atomic energy. The station's reactor operated efficiently and safely for 48 years. On April 29, 2002, the station's reactor was shut down and work began to decommission it. In September 2002, the last fuel assembly was unloaded from the reactor.", "source": {"uri": "kbc.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBC | Kenya's Watching"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Long live the king!\" Reportedly first used by the French in 1422, this proclamation is made with the accession of a new monarch, while announcing the death of the previous monarch and declares continuity by saluting the new monarch.\n\n\"The throne shall never be empty; the country shall never be without a monarch.\"\n\nLikewise, if you are going to kill and replace a global financial system anchored on the US dollar, you better have the next \"king\" ready to go. But before you do that, maybe it is smart to understand the reasons the old king became the king in the first place.\n\nCircle the year 1972 on your calendar when the USD replaced gold as the global reserve currency. And it did not \"just happen\" or because the replacement of gold was good for the world. It was beneficial for the US because the rest of the planet was plundering the US gold reserves in payment for US imports.\n\nWhen the US refused to pay in gold an alternative had to be found. USD made sense for America but only if everyone else would come on board. There always had been a \"reserve currency\" from the Greek drachma, coined in the fifth century B.C., the Venetian ducat, and the Spanish gold Doubloon. But that depended on who was the global trade leader, and all those coins were made of some amount of precious metal silver or gold.\n\nThe USD in 1972 was not backed by gold any longer. So, why the dollar?\n\nThe US had 200 years of continuous political stability. The nation had only two weak and dependent on US trade border neighbors. The US is virtually impervious to armed invasion. It has the largest economy and the largest consumer market. The US government has been -- since 1975 -- willing and eager to increase government debt to any level to back the US dollar. There is about $300 in physical circulation for every person on the planet. At a bar in the depths of an African jungle to kidnappers from Colombia to the Philippines to Italy, all are happy to accept USD in payment.\n\nOne way to be the top dog of global currencies is to make the world pay for its imports in US dollars. That was the purpose of the Petro-Dollar agreement. But even before 2024, Opec would accept payment in other currencies. But there is one major import that must be paid in dollars. If you want \"God's Own Weapons\" made in the US of A, you will pay in \"God's Own Dollars.\" The US global arms export is 42 percent of all global weapons sales, followed by France (11 percent), Russia (11 percent), and China (5.8 percent).\n\nThe biggest buyers of US weapons are Saudi Arabia (the reason for the Petrodollar), Qatar, Japan, Norway, the UK, and Australia. This situation is probably not going to change anytime soon, but it is only one piece of the global currency market.\n\nAnother way to gain control is to \"own\" the international banking transfer system, which is a platform similar to GCash called the \"Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication\" or SWIFT. The US effectively controls SWIFT and therefore can and has shut banks from countries it does not like (read Russia) out of the system. But like PayMaya challenges GCash, Russia set up its \"System for Transmitting Financial Messages (SPFS).\"\n\nWhat keeps the US dollar in control is something that BRICS is having great trouble challenging. It recently set up its own currency swap agreement as the new solution for BRICS countries to de-dollarize. However, it is too small and too complex to have any meaningful impact on the dollar.\n\nDr. Antonio Graceffo, an economist and national security analyst with a focus on China and Russia, said: \"The main issues standing in their way is that the BRICS, which now includes Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, all have relatively weak, non-convertible currencies (not accepted at that jungle bar) and most of which have steadily lost value against the dollar over the past five years.\"\n\n\"Additionally, none of the central banks of BRICS countries are willing to hold large amounts of BRICS currencies as reserves and they are largely useless for international trade with other countries.\"\n\nSo, BRICS established currency swaps with 29 countries worth $550 billion. Each pair has to \"swap\" with the other. If China and India agree to a $20 million swap, they each deposit $20 million worth of their respective currencies in each other's central banks. But for most of the BRICS, the goods would still likely be priced in dollars for stability and consistency.\n\nIf you are going to replace the King, you better have a better replacement ready to go.",

BRICS members are putting their national payment systems, RuPay and MIR, to work. This will reportedly make cross-border transactions smoother between them.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi of India met with Russian officials in Moscow. They discussed integrating RuPay and MIR for trade.\n\nModi confirmed India's openness to using these systems for transactions with Russia, after rejecting the idea of de-dollarization before. Though he did say it was China's yuan he wasn't cool with using.\n\nSee: BRICS' India officially rejects idea of replacing dollar with yuan\n\nThis decision will benefit both India and Russia. They will use their local currencies, saving millions in exchange rates. Andrey Kostin, CEO of Russia's VTB Bank, spoke about this during a press conference. He said:\n\n\"We must develop our own settlement system that includes the global south enabling us to conduct transactions in our own national currencies and not the US dollar.\"\n\nKostin mentioned that integrating RuPay and MIR for trade settlements is a complex process but necessary. India has always maintained a friendly relationship with the United States.\n\nHowever, its recent actions show a shift towards de-dollarization, aligning more with Russia and the BRICS boys. This change was evident when Modi visited Russia after five years.\n\nThe meeting between Modi and Putin set ambitious targets. They aimed for $100 billion in trade between India and Russia by 2030.\n\nRussia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the media that Modi confirmed his attendance at the BRICS summit. Modi also showed interest in strengthening cooperation with G20 nations.\n\nDespite the strong push from BRICS, the US dollar remains the world's primary reserve currency. A new study by the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center shows that neither the euro nor BRICS countries have significantly reduced global reliance on the dollar.\n\nThe \"Dollar Dominance Monitor\" report noted that the dollar continues to dominate foreign reserve holdings, trade invoicing, and currency transactions globally. Its role as the primary global reserve currency is secure in the near and medium term.\n\nThe council reported that China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) added 62 direct participants in 12 months to May 2024, an increase of 78%. This brought the total to 142 direct participants and 1,394 indirect participants.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPay", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RuPay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTB_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VTB Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Border_Interbank_Payment_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross-Border Interbank Payment System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Lavrov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergey Lavrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local_Currency_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local Currency Systems", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714835", "eventUri": "eng-9714835", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Interest rates have been unchanged since August after a series of hikes.\n\nThe decision, which was widely anticipated by economists, is likely to disappoint the governing Conservative Party ahead of the U.K.'s general election in two weeks time. A cut would have been seized upon by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as positive economic news, especially as it would have been accompanied by a fall in mortgage rates.\n\nThe panel insisted that the imminent election, which the main opposition Labour Party led by Keir Starmer is widely expected to win, had no bearing on its decision.\n\n\"The committee noted that the timing of the general election on 4 July was not relevant to its decision at this meeting, which would as usual be made on the basis of what was judged necessary to achieve the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term,\" it said.\n\nFigures on Wednesday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, fell to 2% in the year to May from 2.3% the month before with food prices providing the biggest downward contribution.\n\nThe decline does not mean that prices are falling - they are just rising at a slower rate than they have for the past few years during a cost of living crisis that has seen living standards drop for millions across Britain.\n\nThe fall in inflation follows nearly three years of above-target inflation. The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nThe Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a peak of above 11% in late 2022.\n\nHigher interest rates -- which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow -- have helped ease inflation, but they've also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pan_pylas@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Pan Pylas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/20/Britain_Election_95501_c0-0-7034-4101_s1770x1032.jpg?244e3557abbdefc97fbf493c643783c42554827f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666976", "eventUri": "eng-9666976", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1415, "textEnd": 1421}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

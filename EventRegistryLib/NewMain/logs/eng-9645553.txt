They dedicated a significant amount of time to ensure its quality, resulting in a script that has left the BBC \"very happy\".\n\nSince the announcement of the show's return, Ruth has been inundated with fans eager for spoilers. However, she has playfully misled them by suggesting dramatic plot twists like most of the cast dying or a \"helicopter crash\".\n\nDuring an appearance on the Wondery podcast 'Brydon and' alongside fellow cast member Rob Brydon, Ruth spoke about the challenges they faced when news of the episode leaked in February. She expressed frustration over not being able to confirm the show's return at that time.\n\nRuth, aged 57, also touched on the emotional aspect of the leak, stating: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing since September, which is always the case with us. We write it and then we go to the BBC and say do you want it because if we didn't feel it was going to be good enough, no one else would know and nobody would be any the wiser.\"\n\nWhen the episode airs on Christmas Day, viewers can expect a \"finished story\", reports the Mirror.\n\n\"So, when we felt it was in good enough shape, that's when we contacted the BBC. There was all this stuff about Netflix and a bidding war... absolute rubbish, you just go, where did this come from? And so, once we agreed with the BBC we were going to do it, and obviously they were very happy about it because it's finishing a story and this will be the finale.\"\n\n\"But then there's a whole process and you can't announce it because you've got to make sure the cast are all available, that the deals are done and the budget is in place... all of these things. Then this journalist went and leaked it.\"\n\nWhen they did finally confirm the finale in May, Ruth was on stage in Sister Act and Corden was preparing for a new play, so the photo had to be taken in the theatre dressing room.\n\nShe explained: \"James is rehearsing a play at the moment, The Constituent at the Old Vic, I was doing a show in the night, so the only time we had was a 20-minute crossover before I had to do my warmup and he finished his rehearsals. So, he came to my dressing room in the Dominion Theatre, we got the script with the title on the front, Gavin and Stacey and the finale, and we took a picture in my dressing room of us both holding the script. And that's where it is. And now when people come to see me after the show, they go 'can I get a photo', and yes do you want to get it done where we did the photo of the announcement.\"\n\n\"And it still had an impact, enough time had passed, and people were still really excited.\"\n\nGavin and Stacey remains one of the UK's most cherished sitcoms, with its 2019 Christmas special drawing in over 18 million viewers, making it the most-watched programme of the decade. However, it left fans hanging with Nessa (played by Ruth Jones) popping the question to the lovable Smithy (James Corden).\n\nDuring a recent podcast appearance, Ruth shared with her friend Rob how her role in Sister Act has led to constant queries about the future of Gavin and Stacey.\n\nShe explained: \"At the end of Sister Act, I go out of the stage door and there are often people there wanting programmes signed, which is lovely. But to a man, they'll say 'I'm the biggest Gavin and Stacey fan' or 'thank you so much for this Christmas special' or 'You must be so excited, I can't wait til Christmas'. A couple of people at the stage door, say 'What's going to happen, is Smithy going to say yes? '.\"\n\n\"And I go to them, 'Do you seriously want me to tell you what's going to happen in the Christmas Special? ' And they go 'yes! '. And I go 'but you don't, because what happens on Christmas Day when you come to watch it, you'll know what's going to happen.' And they go, 'please tell me'.\"\n\n\"So, I go (jokingly) 'there's going to be helicopter crash, most of the cast are going to get killed', and I just make stuff up! \".", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_jefferies@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Mark Jefferies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Corden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Corden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Brydon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rob Brydon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_&_Stacey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gavin & Stacey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wondery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wondery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Act_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sister Act (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Vic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Old Vic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominion Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Christmas", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Christmas", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Holidays", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/news/celebs-tv/article9340232.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gavin-and-stacey-generics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645553", "eventUri": "eng-9645553", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

However it now appears this was true, with Ruth commenting on how upset she was about the leak getting out.\n\nThe actress disclosed: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing since September, which is always the case with us.

Then this journalist went and leaked it.\"\n\nWhen the news was officially announced, Ruth and James took an iconic photo and posted it on Instagram to reveal the Christmas episode.\n\nHowever this exciting picture happened under unusual circumstances, with Ruth claiming: \"James is rehearsing a play at the moment, The Constituent at the Old Vic, I was doing a show in the night, so the only time we had was a 20-minute crossover before I had to do my warmup and he finished his rehearsals.

They spent time making sure that it was good enough, and it seems their hard work paid off as the BBC is delighted with it.\n\nAfter news broke last month about the official comeback of the comedy series, actor-writer Ruth has been hounded by eager fans seeking spoilers. However, instead of revealing any juicy details, she has decided to tease them, claiming that most of the series' beloved characters will unfortunately meet their demise due to a potential \"helicopter crash.\"\n\nWhile appearing on Wondery podcast 'Brydon &', hosted by her close friend and fellow cast member Rob Brydon, Ruth opened up about the unfortunate leaking of the episode's production news. She revealed how frustrating it was as they weren't able to officially confirm it was going ahead at the time, back in February.\n\nHowever, come Christmas day, fans will finally see a \"finished story\". Upset about the leak, Ruth, 57, said: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing since September, which is always the case with us.

However, the episode concluded on a tantalising cliffhanger as Nessa (played by Ruth Jones) got down on one knee to propose to the charmingly roguish Smithy (James Corden).\n\nRuth Jones spilled the beans on a new podcast with her friend Rob, sharing that even while she's dazzling audiences in Sister Act, fans are desperate for any tidbits about the future of Gavin and Stacey.\n\nShe said: \"At the end of Sister Act, I go out of the stage door and there's often people there wanting programmes signed, which is lovely.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nRuth Jones has revealed that she and James Corden initiated writing the final episode of Gavin and Stacey in September of the previous year, devoting ample time to ensure its quality.\n\nSince confirming the comeback of the show last month, Ruth, an actor and writer on the series, is constantly bombarded by fans seeking spoilers. However, instead of revealing sitcom secrets, she playfully teased that the majority of the cast might meet their end in a \"helicopter crash\".\n\nWhile guesting on pal and co-star Rob Brydon's Wondery podcast called 'Brydon and', Ruth spoke candidly about her frustration regarding the premature leak of the finale's development news in February when they were not yet ready to officially verify its production. Nevertheless, the 57-year-old assured viewers that by Christmas Day, they will be able to witness a \"finished story\".\n\nShe remarked: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing since September, which is always the case with us. We write it and then we go to the BBC and say do you want it because if we didn't feel it was going to be good enough, no one else would know and nobody would be any the wiser.\n\n\"So, when we felt it was in good enough shape, that's when we contacted the BBC. There was all this stuff about Netflix and a bidding war... absolute rubbish, you just go, where did this come from? And so, once we agreed with the BBC we were going to do it, and obviously they were very happy about it because it's finishing a story and this will be the finale.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nJoin the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nShe continued: \"But then there's a whole process and you can't announce it because you've got to make sure the cast are all available, that the deals are done and the budget is in place... all of these things. Then this journalist went and leaked it.\"\n\nWhen they did finally confirm the finale in May of this year, Ruth was on stage in Sister Act and Corden was preparing for a new play, so the photo had to be taken in the theater dressing room.\n\nShe explained: \"James is rehearsing a play at the moment, The Constituent at the Old Vic, I was doing a show in the night, so the only time we had was a 20-minute crossover before I had to do my warmup and he finished his rehearsals. So, he came to my dressing room in the Dominion Theatre, we got the script with the title on the front, Gavin and Stacey and the finale, and we took a picture in my dressing room of us both holding the script.\n\n\"And that's where it is. And now when people come to see me after the show, they go 'can I get a photo', and yes do you want to get it done where we did the photo of the announcement. And it still had an impact, enough time had passed, and people were still really excited.\"\n\nGavin and Stacey, one of the UK's most cherished sitcoms, saw its 2019 Christmas special become the most-watched programme in a decade with over 18 million viewers tuning in. However, fans were left hanging by the episode's cliffhanger, which featured Nessa (played by Ruth Jones) popping the question to the lovable Smithy (James Corden).\n\nDuring her appearance on a new podcast, Ruth shared with her friend Rob how her role in Sister Act has led to constant queries about the future of Gavin and Stacey.\n\nShe recounted: \"At the end of Sister Act, I go out of the stage door and there are often people there wanting programmes signed, which is lovely. But to a man, they'll say 'I'm the biggest Gavin and Stacey fan' or 'thank you so much for this Christmas special' or 'You must be so excited, I can't wait til Christmas'. A couple of people at the stage door, say 'What's going to happen, is Smithy going to say yes? '.\n\n\"And I go to them, 'Do you seriously want me to tell you what's going to happen in the Christmas Special? ' And they go 'yes! '. And I go 'but you don't, because what happens on Christmas Day when you come to watch it, you'll know what's going to happen.' And they go, 'please tell me'.\n\n\"So, I go (jokingly) 'there's going to be helicopter crash, most of the cast are going to get killed', and I just make stuff up! \".\n\nDuring her conversation with Rob, Ruth also shared an incident from the set of the 1996 film Emma, where she felt belittled by Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nShe recalled: \"I had two lines, I had to announce Gwyneth Paltrow and say, 'Miss Woodhouse is here' and then I had to say 'Goodbye Miss Woodhouse' at the exit and let her out, and GP cut one of my lines. She said, 'Does she really need to say that, can I just come in? ' Imagine this for people who are starting out. You've got two lines, and someone cut 50 percent of your script, it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I had to do the scene letting her out of the house, you can imagine the camera is on the other side of the door, in this beautiful little Dorset village, lovely little thatched cottage. We were waiting for them to shout action, so it was just me and Gwyneth behind the door. She didn't want to talk to me, I was a nothing was I, I had one line then I was down to one. So, I tried to make conversation with her and at the time she was going out with Brad Pitt. And I said, 'do you have any Welsh connections? ' Because {the name} Gwyneth, I always think of as a Welsh name. 'How come you're called Gwyneth? '\".\n\nShe added: \"My mother had a friend called Gwyneth and she really liked the name, so she called my Gwyneth.\" She was quite dismissive of me, so I was thinking it's an old woman's name where I come from so when you get married, you're going to be called Gwyn Pitt!\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

It last aired in 2019 for a one-off festive episode which ended on a cliff-hanger with Nessa, played by Jones, getting down on one knee to propose to Smithy, played by Corden.\n\nThree series of the show, which aired from 2007 to 2010, followed the two titular characters Gavin and Stacey, played by Mathew Horne and Joanna Page, as they pursued a relationship across Essex and Wales. James has revealed his concerns over the \"tight\" schedule to ensure it is filmed and edited in time.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 2's The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show: \"We'll be shooting it (Gavin And Stacey) around September/October time, it's going to be tight to get it in and delivered. But it's such a... building that show is like building a Jenga puzzle, the cast availability and all, things like that. I think it will be okay, yeah.\"\n\nThe actor is set to be in a London stage production of political drama The Constituent at The Old Vic from late June, following his exit from talkshow The Late Late Show With James Corden. He added that once he \"opens the play\", he and Ruth have to do \"one last pass and clean-up\" of the script before sharing it with the Gavin And Stacey cast.\n\nHe also said: \"We don't really want to give it to anyone, unless we feel like it... so we need to make a few trims, and a few little adjustments, but I'm very excited to share it with people.\" Sharing the news on Instagram in an exciting post on May 3, Corden put up a picture featuring him and Jones with the script which read: \"Gavin and Stacey: The finale.\"\n\nHe captioned this wining photo with: \"Some news... It's official! ! ! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey. See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James.\" Viewers can look forward to seeing the Gavin And Stacey Christmas special aired on Christmas Day on BBC One and iPlayer.\n\nRuth has also revealed the duo started writing the script last September and spent a long time ensuring it was good enough. Since the announcement, she has been besieged by fans asking for spoilers. However, instead of dishing gossip about the sitcom she has resorted to making up wild suggestions even joking most of the cast will die and there could be a \"helicopter crash\".\n\nSpeaking on Wondery podcast Brydon & with close friend and cast member Rob Brydon, Ruth admitted she was annoyed rumours had got out they were working on a new episode. She said: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing since September, which is always the case with us.

And it's awful because you don't want to diminish that.\n\nREAD MORE: Gavin & Stacey favourite who didn't appear in Christmas special set to return for finale\n\nLATEST: James Corden in 'tense' exchange with British Airways staff after flight ordeal\n\n\"I tell you what I do find interesting though is that a couple of people, again at the stage door, will say to me 'What's going to happen, tell me what's going to happen, is Smithy going to say yes?'\n\n\"And I go to them, 'Do you seriously want me to tell you what's going to happen in the Christmas Special? ' And they go 'yes! '. And I go 'but you don't, because then what happens on Christmas Day when you come to watch it, you'll know what's going to happen.' And they go, 'please tell me'.\"\n\nSharing how she reacts to those seeking spoilers, Ruth jokingly shared: \"So, I just go 'Okay, there's going to be a helicopter crash, most of the cast are going to get killed', and I just make stuff up!\"\n\nShe added: \"I will enjoy it when the time comes, but, I'm sure you feel the same as me, at the age we are now there is less time ahead of us than behind and I want to enjoy every day, so right now I am enjoying doing this podcast with my old friend and this afternoon I will be going into rehearsals, tonight I will be doing a show, and I am enjoying that and I want to enjoy doing Sister Act.\"\n\nRuth also shared that she was \"very sad\" the finale got leaked before she and James were able to share the news. She explained: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing it since September, which is always the case with us. We write it and then we go to the BBC and say do you want it because if we didn't feel it was going to be good enough, then nobody else would know and nobody would be any the wiser.\n\n\"So, when we felt it was in good enough shape, that's when we contacted the BBC. There was all this stuff about Netflix and a bidding war... absolute rubbish, you just go, where did this come from? And so, once we agreed with the BBC we were going to do it, and obviously they were very happy about it because it's finishing a story and this will be the finale.\"\n\nShe added: \"But then there's a whole process and you can't announce it because you've got to make sure the cast are all available, that the deals are done and the budget is in place... all of these things. Then this journalist went and leaked it.\"\n\nRuth and James confirmed the final episode of Gavin & Stacey in May, months after it was first reported in February. James posted a picture of himself and Ruth on Instagram with the caption: \"Some news... It's official!!! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey.

Then this journalist went and leaked it.\"\n\nWhen they did finally confirm the finale in May, Ruth was on stage in Sister Act and Corden was preparing for a new play, so the photo had to be taken in the theatre dressing room.\n\nShe explained: \"James is rehearsing a play at the moment, The Constituent at the Old Vic, I was doing a show in the night, so the only time we had was a 20-minute crossover before I had to do my warmup and he finished his rehearsals.\n\n\"So, he came to my dressing room in the Dominion Theatre, we got the script with the title on the front, Gavin and Stacey and the finale, and we took a picture in my dressing room of us both holding the script.\n\n\"And that's where it is. And now when people come to see me after the show, they go 'can I get a photo', and yes do you want to get it done where we did the photo of the announcement.

But it ended with a cliffhanger, with Nessa (Ruth) proposing to the ever-cheeky but loveable Smithy (Corden).\n\nSpeaking on the new podcast, Ruth went on to tell pal Rob that whilst performing in Sister Act she is being bugged for info about the sitcom and how it might finish.\n\nShe said: \"At the end of Sister Act, I go out of the stage door and people and there's often people there wanting programmes signed, which is lovely. But to a man, they'll say 'I'm the biggest Gavin and Stacey fan' or 'thank you so much for this Christmas special' or 'You must be so excited, I can't wait til Christmas'. A couple of people at the stage door, say 'What's going to happen, is Smithy going to say yes? '.\"\n\n\"And I go to them, 'Do you seriously want me to tell you what's going to happen in the Christmas Special? ' And they go 'yes! '. And I go 'but you don't, because what happens on Christmas Day when you come to watch it, you'll know what's going to happen.' And they go, 'please tell me'.\"\n\n\"So, I go (jokingly) 'there's going to be helicopter crash, most of the cast are going to get killed', and I just make stuff up! \".\n\nDuring her conversation with Rob, Ruth also shared an incident from the set of the 1996 film Emma, where she felt belittled by Gwyneth Paltrow. She recalled: \"I had two lines, I had to announce Gwyneth Paltrow and say, 'Miss Woodhouse is here' and then I had to say 'Goodbye Miss Woodhouse' at the exit and let her out.\n\n\"And GP cut one of my lines. She said, 'Does she really need to say that, can I just come in? ' Imagine this for people who are starting out. You've got two lines, and someone cut 50% of your script, it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I had to do the scene letting her out of the house, you can imagine the camera is on the other side of the door, in this beautiful little Dorset village, lovely little thatched cottage. We were waiting for them to shout action, so it was just me and Gwyneth behind the door.\n\n\"She didn't want to talk to me, I was a nothing was I, I had one line then I was down to one. So, I tried to make conversation with her and at the time she was going out with Brad Pitt. And I said, 'do you have any Welsh connections? ' Because {the name} Gwyneth, I always think of as a Welsh name. 'How come you're called Gwyneth? '\".\n\nShe added: \"My mother had a friend called Gwyneth and she really liked the name, so she called my Gwyneth. She was quite dismissive of me, so I was thinking it's an old woman's name where I come from so when you get married, you're going to be called Gwyn Pitt!\"\n\nWant all the biggest Showbiz and TV news straight to your inbox?

Demand to see the performance is so low that prices for the next fortnight have gone from \u00a354 to \u00a315, with top tier \u00a3108 tickets even available at \u00a320.\n\nFans can get to see the show for a knock-down price with just over half sold for tonight's performance. Nessa actress Ruth is the latest star to sign up, with singing great Beverley Knight, X Factor winner Alexandra Burke and Birds of the Feather favourite Leslie Joseph also taking on the religious role.\n\nAfter a deal was struck, Ruth shared last year: \"I'm proper chuffed to be making my West End debut in Sister Act playing the legendary Mother Superior at the Dominion Theatre. It's a crackin' role and a crackin' show. Who knew wearing a habit could feel so fabulous! I can't wait!\"\n\nRuth is certainly busy right now. The much-anticipated return of Gavin and Stacey later this year has sent fans into a frenzy, with rumours swirling that stars James Corden and his co-writer rejected a hefty Netflix deal to air the Christmas special on BBC One.\n\nReports suggest a fierce battle between BBC and Netflix for the rights to the sitcom's festive revival, which was officially announced by James Corden on Instagram. In a black and white photo featuring himself and co-creator Ruth clutching the special's script, the pair revealed that Gavin and Stacey: The Finale will hit screens this Christmas, exclusively on BBC One.\n\nJames captioned the eagerly-awaited post: \"Some news... It's official! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey. See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James.\" The decision to turn down Netflix's enticing offer, rumoured to include a multi-million-pound deal and promises of global exposure, was driven by loyalty to the BBC and the show's dedicated UK audience.\n\nAn insider told The Sun: \"They held conversations with Netflix who threw everything at them to land what is seen as a gem of British comedy. James, Ruth and the team were effectively offered a multi-million-pound one-off deal, and were promised it would open the show up to a whole new international audience.\"\n\n\"Obviously it was tempting, but they felt Gavin and Stacey belonged to the BBC - and the nation, really. The optics wouldn't have been great had they 'sold out' so they went with their hearts, not the cash,\" they added.

Ruth, 57, said: \"I was very sad that it got leaked. James and I had been writing since September, which is always the case with us. We write it and then we go to the BBC and say do you want it because if we didn't feel it was going to be good enough, no one else would know and nobody would be any the wiser.\n\n\"So, when we felt it was in good enough shape, that's when we contacted the BBC. There was all this stuff about Netflix and a bidding war... absolute rubbish, you just go, where did this come from? And so, once we agreed with the BBC we were going to do it, and obviously they were very happy about it because it's finishing a story and this will be the finale.\n\n\"But then there's a whole process and you can't announce it because you've got to make sure the cast are all available, that the deals are done and the budget is in place... all of these things. Then this journalist went and leaked it.\" When they did finally confirm the finale in May, Ruth was on stage in Sister Act and Corden was preparing for a new play, so the photo had to be taken in the theatre dressing room.\n\nShe explained: \"James is rehearsing a play at the moment, The Constituent at the Old Vic, I was doing a show in the night, so the only time we had was a 20-minute crossover before I had to do my warmup and he finished his rehearsals. So, he came to my dressing room in the Dominion Theatre, we got the script with the title on the front, Gavin & Stacey and the finale, and we took a picture in my dressing room of us both holding the script. And that's where it is. And now when people come to see me after the show, they go 'can I get a photo', and yes do you want to get it done where we did the photo of the announcement.\n\n\"And it still had an impact, enough time had passed, and people were still really excited.\" Gavin & Stacey is one of the most loved British sitcoms of all time and the 2019 Christmas special was the most-watched show in a decade at more than 18 million viewers. But it ended with a cliffhanger, with Nessa (Ruth) proposing to the ever-cheeky but loveable Smithy (Corden).\n\nSpeaking on the new podcast, Ruth went on to tell pal Rob that whilst performing in Sister Act she is being bugged for info about the sitcom and how it might finish.\n\nShe said: \"At the end of Sister Act, I go out of the stage door and people and there's often people there wanting programmes signed, which is lovely. But to a man, they'll say 'I'm the biggest Gavin & Stacey fan' or 'thank you so much for this Christmas special' or 'You must be so excited, I can't wait til Christmas'. A couple of people at the stage door, say 'What's going to happen, is Smithy going to say yes?'.\n\n\"And I go to them, 'Do you seriously want me to tell you what's going to happen in the Christmas Special?' And they go 'yes!'. And I go 'but you don't, because what happens on Christmas Day when you come to watch it, you'll know what's going to happen.' And they go, 'please tell me'.\n\n\"So, I go (jokingly) 'there's going to be helicopter crash, most of the cast are going to get killed', and I just make stuff up!\"\n\nDuring her chat with Rob, Ruth also reveals how Gwyneth Paltrow talked down to her on set in 1996 film Emma when she had a small part.\n\nShe said: \"I had two lines, I had to announce Gwyneth Paltrow and say, \"Miss Woodhouse is here\" and then I had to say \"Goodbye Miss Woodhouse\" at the exit and let her out, and GP cut one of my lines. She said, \"Does she really need to say that, can I just come in?\" Imagine this for people who are starting out. You've got two lines, and someone cut 50% of your script, it's heartbreaking.\"\n\nShe added: \"I had to do the scene letting her out of the house, you can imagine the camera is on the other side of the door, in this beautiful little Dorset village, lovely little thatched cottage. We were waiting for them to shout action, so it was just me and Gwyneth behind the door. She didn't want to talk to me, I was a nothing was I, I had one line then I was down to one. So, I tried to make conversation with her and at the time she was going out with Brad Pitt. And I said, \"do you have any Welsh connections?\" Because {the name} Gwyneth, I always think of as a Welsh name. \"How come you're called Gwyneth?\"\n\nShe said: \"My mother had a friend called Gwyneth and she really liked the name, so she called my Gwyneth.\" She was quite dismissive of me, so I was thinking it's an old woman's name where I come from so when you get married, you're going to be called Gwyn Pitt!\"\n\nBrydon & from Wondery is available tomorrow on Wondery+ and everywhere you get your podcasts.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,

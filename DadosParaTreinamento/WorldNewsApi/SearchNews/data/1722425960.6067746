{"id": 243251366, "title": "The Edinburgh Airport runway where Spitfires once landed earmarked for homes just minutes walk from terminal", "text": "It is a hidden sliver of Edinburgh that was built as a military air training base in the First World War that could become part of the UK\u2019s biggest housing expansion, enabling residents to walk to the capital\u2019s airport in 20 minutes. Crosswind Developments has shown off the airport\u2019s former runway, nestled between the city\u2019s tram depot, the tree-lined Gogar Burn and the railway line to the Forth Bridge. Since the last aircraft landed there nine years ago, it is now used for valet parking. But Crosswind wants to use part of the runway - and the grass-covered approach - for its 3,000 home Elements Edinburgh scheme as its \u00a31 billion contribution to a string of separate proposals wrapped round the southern and eastern edges of the airport. The firm has submitted a revised 72-acre version of a larger scheme announced in 2017, which the city council will consider as part of its City Plan strategy that was approved by councillors on Thursday. The neighbouring 7,000-home West Town scheme is to the south of the airport, while more than 400 homes have been built as part of the West Craigs development to the east. Crosswind expects its plans to be considered by councillors in August. If approved, building could start in 2026. The development would include an access road from the Gogar roundabout running parallel to the west side of the rail line, which could be extended by the airport to provide a much-needed second link to the terminal. That would relieve pressure on the main Eastfield Road approach from the A8, which the airport said was \u201creally creaking at the seams\u201d. What started as a grass landing strip in 2016 for a Royal Flying Corps (pre-RAF) training squadron was used by Spitfires defending Edinburgh during the Second World War, then passenger aircraft until the present runway was built in 1977. Stars who landed there include The Beatles in 1964, and Marlene Dietrich and Burt Bacharach the following year. But it regularly suffered from strong crosswinds that forced flight cancellations. One 1970s passenger jet pilot told author Keith McCloskey in Edinburgh Airport - A History that because of its short length, he had to engage reverse thrust before touchdown to stop before the end of the runway. The pilot said it was a scary experience for passengers because aircraft also had to land with a \u201creal thump\u201d so the brakes could be applied quickly. Crosswind plans to create homes in blocks up to six storeys rather than traditional suburban houses with gardens to maximise shared green space, which will comprise almost half the site. Transport in Scotland is a key issue - get our specialist newsletter for the best updates But project director David Kelman said despite the site\u2019s proximity to the airport, noise from the A8 was more audible than from aircraft, which was predominantly along their south west to north-east flight path. City council leader Cammy Day said: \u201cThe size of development possible in Gogarburn and the surrounding area is comparable to a whole new town. This is change on a scale Edinburgh hasn\u2019t seen in decades, so the desire of developers to work positively together to create an incredible destination for people to live and work is great to see. \u201cWe need to make sure these changes are managed in line with our ambitious City Plan 2030, which won unanimous backing from councillors on Thursday, and Edinburgh\u2019s journey towards net zero. So, I\u2019m particularly pleased to see that Crosswinds\u2019 aspirations are consistent with our own, offering the type of ambitious change we will need to drive fantastic growth in the west.\" A spokesperson for Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce said: \"We have been supportive of this application as it is a major component of the broader development of West Edinburgh. \u201cThe plans aim to provide thousands of much-needed new homes, including a significant amount of high-quality affordable housing, which is essential in the face of the ongoing housing crisis.\u201d", "summary": "<p>It is a hidden sliver of Edinburgh that was built as a military air training base in the First World War that could become part of the UK\u2019s biggest housing expansion, enabling residents to walk to the capital\u2019s airport in 20 minutes.</p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/heritage-and-retro/heritage/edinburgh-airport-runway-crosswind-spitfire-beatles-4683259", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/2024/06/28/14/47/onecms_eab14beb-092f-481d-81bf-f2185acfcaa0.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:47:24", "author": "Alastair Dalton", "authors": ["Alastair Dalton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.173}

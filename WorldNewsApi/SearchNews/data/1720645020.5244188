{"id": 231324306, "title": "Fans slam surgeon claiming Jennifer Aniston's face has 'botched fillers'", "text": "Doctor Devine was analysing a viral photoshoot of Jennifer Aniston at a The Morning Show event earlier this month (Picture: Gilbert Flores/Getty) Doctor Richard Devine, self-proclaimed aesthetic surgeon, has stirred controversy after professing that Jennifer Aniston\u2019s face filler had \u2018gone wrong\u2019 in a new TikTok. The influencer physician \u2013 founder of the mobile aesthetic clinic Carriages of Harley Street \u2013 posted a video to his 115k followers on the possible medical reasoning behind the 55-year-old actor\u2019s \u2018extremely puffy and swollen\u2019 under eyes during a recent promotional event. \u2018While the under eyes do change with age this is definitely not what we\u2019re seeing here,\u2019 he said. \u2018There are clear telltale signs of too much tear trough filler.\u2019 This is when the hyaluronic acid gel is injected into the tear trough (under the eye) area and boosts collagen production to replace any lost volume from the ageing process. It is a minimally invasive, non-permanent treatment so fillers can be dissolved. Doctor Devine argued that the area of swelling and ridge-like structures correlated with where the \u2018dermal filler\u2019 sits and has \u2018projected so much\u2019 that they have caused shadows under the eye. @doctor.devine Why does Jennifer Aniston look so different? #jenniferaniston #celebtok #celebrity #teartroughfiller #fillergonewrong #overfilled #teartroughfillergonewrong #friends #drdevine #fyp #foryou #trending \u266c original sound \u2013 Doctor Devine The almost two-minute-long video concluded by saying \u2018complications happen, even to the biggest superstars in the world who have access to the best doctors.\u2019 However, fans in the comments have come to the Friends star\u2019s defence, telling Doctor Devine to \u2018leave her alone\u2019 and pointing out the issue with continued \u2018scrutiny\u2019 of a woman\u2019s appearance. \u2018I wish people would leave her alone, she\u2019s beautiful no matter what,\u2019 @francinef wrote. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine being a celebrity and people doing this thorough analysis of your face,\u2019 @dyanchrisdine added. Women in Hollywood are regularly subjected to scrutiny over their looks (Picture: Getty) The actor has previously said she would never \u2018inject anything\u2019 into her face (Picture: FilmMagic) While @timetoshine shared: \u2018Who cares, she\u2019s in her 50s and was an icon for 20 years, let her do what she wants.\u2019 \u2018Stop criticizing people\u2019s looks! She\u2019s going to age as we humans all will do,\u2019 @user6734286743664 echoed. \u2018Haven\u2019t you got work to do? Stop wasting your time telling us this nonsense \u2013 leave her appearance alone!\u2019 @mand slammed. \u2018How about we not shame people the way we are here and maybe they\u2019ll leave their faces alone,\u2019 @colourfulcolarado added. While others argued that, now in hay fever season, the swelling could have simply been allergies. \u2018My phone doesn\u2019t even recognise my face because of my puffy eyes and face due to allergies,\u2019 @rachelbm wrote. \u2018Or she has allergies. Never had filler but my eyes look exactly like that with hayfever,\u2019 @hayls agreed. She rose to fame as Rachel Green in Friends (Picture: NBC/Getty) The TV and film icon has said she learnt from her peers \u2018mistakes\u2019 when it comes to surgery (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) In 2014, the actor opened up about her aversion to cosmetic touch-ups after seeing her Hollywood peers undergo it. \u2018I am grateful to learn from their mistakes because I am not injecting s**t into my face,\u2019 she said at the time. \u2018Honestly, I see them and my heart breaks. I think, \u201cOh god, if you only knew how much older you look.\u201d They are trying to stop the clock and all you see is an insecure person who won\u2019t let themselves just age. \u2018Sometimes I wish I could beg the people I know, who I am very near and dear to, to not touch their face.\u2019 The actor was recently moved to tears during a Variety Actors on Actors interview with Abbott Elementary\u2019s Quinta Brunston after she was asked what it\u2019s like to watch Friends now (following Matthew Perry\u2019s death). The actor was brought to tears after talking about Friends, 30 years on (Picture: Variety) \u2018Oh God, don\u2019t make me cry,\u2019 she said, before using a tissue to mop up the stray tears. After the death of co-star Matthew in October last year, an insider opened up about how the Rachel Green actor was \u2018knocked off her feet\u2019. \u2018Out of the remaining five, Jen and Courteney [Cox] are reeling the most, and Jen is probably the one who is struggling most acutely,\u2019 the source continued. The Emmy-winning actor recently celebrated the release of the third season of the acclaimed Apple TV+ series, The Morning Show, in which she plays host Alex Levy. It has already been renewed for a fourth season. After starring in Friends, for which she landed a Golden Globe, from 1994 to 2004 opposite Matthew, Courteney, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc the actor has gone on to have a hugely successful career. She has starred in several hit films including We\u2019re The Millers, Horrible Bosses and Marley & Me. Got a story?

These early tests give us a first insight into the performance of the new processor compared to its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D \"Zen 4\", which features the innovative 3D V-Cache. The benchmarks show that the Ryzen 9 9900X lags behind the older model in some aspects, although it is certainly competitive in other areas.\n\nSaddyTech tested the Ryzen 9 9900X on a Gigabyte X670 AORUS Elite AX motherboard with the latest BIOS version and DDR5-7200 memory configured with a 2400 fabric clock. For comparison, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D was used, which was tested in various popular games at resolutions of 1080p, 1440p and 2160p. These tests were intended to reflect the performance of the two processors under typical gaming conditions.\n\nAlan Wake 2: In this game, the Ryzen 9 9900X showed slightly better average FPS scores, but the Ryzen 7 7800X3D came out on top in the important 1% and 0.1% low FPS scores. These metrics are crucial as they represent the frame rate drops that can affect the gaming experience.\n\nCall of Duty Warzone 2: The Ryzen 7 7800X3D was again ahead in the 1% and 0.1% low FPS scores, while the average FPS of both processors was almost identical. This shows that the older processor remains more stable in intensive gaming situations.\n\nCounter-Strike 2: This title, known for its high CPU dependency, was clearly dominated by the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. It led in all three metrics measured: average FPS, 1% low FPS and 0.1% low FPS.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: At the highest resolution of 4K, both processors were on par, which indicates that the graphics card is the bottleneck here. At lower resolutions, however, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D had clear advantages, which indicates its better ability to distribute the CPU load efficiently.\n\nFortnite: The Ryzen 7 7800X3D also performed better in this popular game and was significantly faster than the Ryzen 9 9900X.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X showed an average power consumption of 102W during gaming, with peak values of 111W. The temperatures remained within reasonable limits: An average of 66\u00b0C was measured, with a maximum temperature of 85\u00b0C reached in Cyberpunk 2077. These values confirm AMD's claim of lower power consumption and temperature compared to the previous Ryzen 7000 CPUs. The first benchmarks show that the Ryzen 9 9900X lags behind the Ryzen 7 7800X3D in some games. Nevertheless, the Ryzen 9 9900X could be convincing as a multi-thread processor, especially if the price is competitive. It remains to be seen how the processor performs in a wider range of games and applications. Further testing and analysis will be required to assess the full potential of the new chip.\n\nAMD plans to launch the Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" desktop CPUs on July 31. In addition, AMD has stated that the Ryzen 7 9700X should be about 2% faster than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. It is important to note that the current benchmarks are based on a limited number of games and actual performance in other applications may vary.

I'm sorry to report that you'll need to curb it, at least for a couple of weeks. AMD has amended the launch date for the Ryzen 9000 series to August 8th for Ryzen 5/7 chips and August 15th for Ryzen 9. Apologies for the technical industry jargon, but: phooey.\n\nAn AMD representative told PCWorld that the delay is due to a quality issue with the first wave of chips. The company wanted to be abundantly cautious, and considering the high-profile issues Intel has had with its most powerful chips as of late, it seems like a little caution is warranted. AMD assures us that every chip that makes it to retailers at launch will be screened for the issue.\n\nHere is AMD's full statement from Jack Huynh, SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics:\n\n\"We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processors. During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations. Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units. As a result, there will be a short delay in retail availability. The Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors will now go on sale on August 8th and the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X processors will go on-sale on August 15th. We pride ourselves in providing a high-quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series.\"\n\nWe're still waiting on the pricing for the launch series of chips -- the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X, 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X, 8-core Ryzen 7 9700X, and 6-core Ryzen 5 9600X. Note that the last-gen Ryzen 9 7950X started with a retail price of $700, though there have been plenty of opportunities to get it at a significant discount. X3D variants, with the popular game-boosting V-Cache feature, will undoubtedly follow later this year or in early 2025.\n\nEarly testing leaks claim that the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X can beat Intel's latest and greatest Core i9-14900K by 30+ percent in at least some benchmarks, with impressive cooling at identical power levels.

This review is still online and hasn't been taken down because the outlet managed to snag a retail version of the CPU early.\n\nThe 12-core CPU with a Boost Clock of 5.6 GHz and a 120W power rating isn't the flagship option in the new Zen 5 line-up (that title goes to the Ryzen 9 9950X), but it's still up there as an enthusiast-grade, high-end desktop CPU. With that, SaddyTech tested the Ryzen 9 9900X in ten games, comparing performance to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D gaming processor.\n\nThe test rig sports a GeForce RTX 4090 GPU (to minimize bottlenecks), an X670 motherboard, and DDR5-7200 memory. Gaming performance between the two CPUs is close, with the 7800X3D pulling ahead, with up to double-digit gains in some titles.\n\nThe complete list of games tested: Alan Wake 2, Total War Warhammer, City Skylines 2, Call of Duty: Warzone 2, CS: GO 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, and The Last of Us: Part 1.\n\nLooking at 1080p gaming performance, the 7800X3D can deliver an impressive 23% lead compared to the brand-new Zen 5 9900X - with this figure dropping to around 15% when looking at games like Cyberpunk 2077, The Last of Us: Part I, and Fortnite. Increasing the resolution to 1440p and performance between the two CPUs is closer and even closer when gaming in 4K.\n\nIn 4K, the newer Ryzen 9 9900X is faster in games like Starfield, performing roughly the same or within a few percent of the 7800X3D. However, the SaddyTech review does note that the 9900X draws more power when gaming, sometimes double that of the 7800X3D and runs warmer.\n\nThe conclusion from this review is simple - if you're looking to build a new AMD gaming rig, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is the better option. That, and wait for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which will most likely turn up later this year. Naturally, when it comes to productivity, the 9900X will be notably faster than the 7800X3D-however, it's hard not to be a little underwhelmed with the results we see here.", "source": {"uri": "tweaktown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TweakTown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kosta_andreadis@tweaktown.com", "name": "Kosta Andreadis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hogwarts Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfield_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starfield (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Warzone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Warzone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War_(video_game_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Total War (video game series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GeForce 20 series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Wake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberpunk 2077"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1440p", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1440p"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/9/99489_11_amd-ryzen-9-9900x-gaming-benchmarks-leaked-slightly-slower-than-7-7800x3d_full.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The CPUs were originally introduced at Computex 2024 during AMD's keynote and the company lifted the first preview embargo while announcing the 31st July launch date on the 15th of July. The plan has now changed a bit and it looks like the 8th & 15th of August are the new targeted release dates.\n\nThe 15th August launch is the latest timeframe of when we can expect the sales of AMD's Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" Desktop CPUs to commence on retail shelves. The 6 and 8-core parts, the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X, will still hit shelves a bit earlier on the 8th of August while the 12 and 16-core parts, the Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X, start on the 15th of August.\n\nThis shouldn't be a major delay since it's about two weeks and this gives both customers and partners a bit more time to prep for the upcoming launch. Customers can spend the extra time to ensure that their PCs are ready and outfitted with the latest BIOS that offers support for Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" Desktop CPUs while partners can do some last-minute bug sorting on their respective platforms.\n\nSo far, AMD has shared the specifications and a few 1st party performance benchmarks of their entire Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" Desktop portfolio but the company has not shared any pricing info with anyone yet. We can expect AMD to provide an update on the prices as we get closer to the new launch window but till then, you can check out our detailed article covering everything about the Ryzen 9000 CPUs including the Ryzen 9 9950X, Ryzen 9 9900X, Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 5 9600X.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hassan_mujtaba@wccftech.com", "name": "Hassan Mujtaba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet_PCs", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Tablet PCs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Diagnostics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMD-Ryzen-9000-Zen-5-CPU-Delay.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 110, "freq": 6}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1340, "textEnd": 1352, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 1540, "textEnd": 1552}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 999, "textEnd": 1007, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Since we're talking about a two-week delay, this is the right call.\n\nThis also highlights one of the biggest issues with PC hardware. The first batch of CPUs, motherboards, GPUs and RAM may often have some faults. For instance, the first batch of the X670E Aorus Master motherboards has issues with the bottom M.2 PCIe SSD slots. Later versions of this MB do not suffer from it. Moreover, the first batch of some older GPUs had temperature issues and weak overclocking capabilities. Similarly, the first batch of older CPUs could not be overclocked as much as their later versions.\n\nA couple of days ago, we also shared the first third-party gaming benchmarks for the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X.

AMD is in the process of recalling the CPUs it has already shipped, which isn't an easy feat.

I can confirm that this is indeed the case. Earlier today after contacting AMD for clarification, it initially remained unclear why no samples had been distributed yet. This lack of distribution, especially just a week before the embargo is lifted, seemed unusual. However, later today, I received a call from AMD informing me that the launch of the Ryzen 9000 series has been slightly delayed. In this news item you can find all the info we can share.\n\nThe reason (from what we understand) for this delay is that during the shipment phase to its partners, an initial sample batch revealed issues with quality assurance. This issue was identified very early in that process. AMD has been taking the necessary time to ensure that everything meets its high standards, aiming to avoid mistakes later on in the release phase. AMD has not provided detailed explanations about the specific problems they encountered, but they have emphasized that these issues were not related to the manufacturing process or the CPUs themselves. Initially, AMD hinted at the possibility of moving up their review timeline if circumstances allowed. This was later substantiated by a fresh statement they released just before the embargo on this article was lifted, which introduced the revised embargo details mentioned above. Despite these uncertainties, AMD has issued an official statement which we are now able to share.\n\n\"We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processors. During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations. Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units.

We pride ourselves in providing a high-quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series.\n\nWhat occurred? The details are somewhat vague. AMD's Senior Vice President and General Manager, Jack Huynh, explained the problem on social media, referring to it as a \"packaging issue.\" According to AMD, the initial batch of processors did not reach the expected quality levels. As a result, these units are being recalled, and AMD is distributing new units that have been thoroughly checked and are free from this problem.\n\nThe positive news amidst this situation is that AMD expects to begin shipping at least the 6- and 8-core samples to reviewers by next week, with retail sales projected to start in August 8th for the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X and the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X processors will go on-sale on August 15th. In the worst-case scenario, this represents a delay of a maximum of two weeks from the initially planned launch schedule. This delay, while inconvenient, ensures that once the product reaches the market, it adheres to the quality standards expected by both AMD and its customers, maintaining consumer trust and satisfaction.\n\n-- Hilbert", "source": {"uri": "guru3d.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guru3D.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilbert_hagedoorn@guru3d.com", "name": "Hilbert Hagedoorn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Quality_Control_and_Tracking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Quality Control and Tracking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/International_Organization_for_Standardization_-_ISO", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/International Organization for Standardization - ISO", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Special Needs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Quality_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Quality Engineering", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.guru3d.com/data/publish/223/b66b6892493417d762e61ab29969c5e596356c/ryzen9000_guru3d_delid.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2076, "textEnd": 2086, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 2157, "textEnd": 2168, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

And, from what we can see, this upcoming CPU is actually slower than the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D in various CPU-bound games.\n\nSaddyTech benchmarked 10 PC games. These were Alan Wake 2, Total War Warhammer 3, Cities Skylines 2, COD: Warzone 2, CS: GO 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite, Hogwarts Legacy and Starfield.\n\nIn Alan Wake 2, COD: Warzone 2, Total War: Warhammer 3 and Starfield, the AMD Ryzen 9 9900X was able to match the performance of the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. However, in all the other games, the 9900X was noticeably slower than the 7800X3D.\n\nThis pretty much shows how important the 3D V-Cache of the AMD CPUs is for a number of modern-day titles. This is also why we always recommend these CPUs for gamers. And yes, you should definitely wait for the 9900X3D (or whatever it will be called).\n\nAMD plans to release the Ryzen 9 9900X CPU on July 31st. If you already own a 7800X3D or a 7950X3D, you can safely skip this generation of AMD CPUs. Yes, you might get a small performance boost with the 3D V-Cache variant. However, there is no point in upgrading to that CPU if you already have one of these two CPUs.\n\nWe expect more gaming benchmarks to surface when the 9900X comes out (or a day before its launch).

The review offers a comparative analysis of the Ryzen 9 9900X and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, focusing primarily on their gaming performance. The Ryzen 9 9900X is a 12-core CPU with a boost clock speed of up to 5.6 GHz, a TDP of 120W, and an expected market price of approximately $550 to $600. SaddyTech's sample is a retail unit, confirmed by its recent manufacturing date and 2424 laser engraving. The test setup included a GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card, an X670 motherboard, DDR5-7200 memory, and a Be Quiet Dark Rock 4 air cooler.\n\nIn the gaming performance tests, the reviewer highlighted that the Ryzen 9 9900X demands more power than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D in certain games. For instance, in Counter-Strike 2, the 9900X consumes up to 107W, whereas the 7800X3D only requires 53W. Temperature-wise, the 9900X runs at around 67\u00b0C compared to the 7800X3D's 63\u00b0C. However, in more demanding games like Cyberpunk, the 9900X's temperature can spike up to 82\u00b0C. He concluded that despite the higher performance capabilities of the Ryzen 9 9900X, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D might be a better option for gamers, especially considering the potential lower cost. AMD has yet to confirm the final pricing for the Ryzen 9000 series, which is set to officially launch on July 31.\n\nThe review also noted that the Ryzen 9 9900X is not an engineering sample but a production model, indicating that the performance metrics should be reflective of what consumers can expect upon release. This early review provides valuable insights for those considering upgrading their gaming rigs, with a clear emphasis on the power consumption and thermal performance differences between the two processors.\n\nSource: saddytech", "source": {"uri": "guru3d.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guru3D.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilbert_hagedoorn@guru3d.com", "name": "Hilbert Hagedoorn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_20_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GeForce 20 series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counter-Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.guru3d.com/data/publish/223/0d263cd874ac24d065082e2034b0cf49ad22cd/amd_ryzen_9900x_benchmarks_7.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1381, "textEnd": 1388}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

They appear to have obtained a retail sample too, which should perform similarly to reviews out next week although as they're ahead of the NDA by exactly seven days, it's possible drivers and BIOS updates may see slightly different performance on the day. In short, it's as we expected.\n\nThe older X3D CPU with its 3D V-Cache was faster on average, which was widely expected given how its 3D V-cache boosts performance in games. The YouTuber, whose video you can see here, used an Nvidia RTX 4090 graphics card and 7200 DDR5 memory.\n\nAt 1080p, which is a resolution that typically puts more load on the CPU, the Ryzen 9 9900X was around 10 percent slower with sizeable gaps in games such as Cities Skylines II, Cyberpunk 2077, Fortnite and Hogwarts Legacy. However, in games such as Alan Wake 2, COD: Warzone 2 and Starfield, there was little difference between the two CPUs. Below you can see the performance in average frame rates and in the second graph, the percentage differences.\n\nAt 1440p there's less of an emphasis on the CPU, and here as expected the difference fell to just six percent overall. IT should be noted that at this resolution, using a less powerful graphics card than the RTX 4090 used here will result in far less of a performance difference.\n\nThe six percent difference can be seen a little easier in the graph below with the biggest differences again in Cities Skylines II, Hogwarts Legacy, Cyberpunk 2077 and Counter Strike Go 2.\n\nSurprisingly there was also a four percent advantage to the Ryen 7 7800X3D at 4K, but we are dealing with a massively powerful RTX 4090 here which the vast majority gamers out there won't have. Again if you have something like an RTX 4070 or Radeon RX 7800 XT, you'll likely see little to no performance difference at this resolution.\n\nAgain, the percentage differences are make a little cleaerer below. Obviously if you play a lot of Cities Skylines II then you'll want to consider the Ryzen 7 7800X3D but otherwise there was very little difference bwteen the two CPUs.\n\nIt's an interesting quandary for AMD, which is essentially competing against itself and the standard Ryzen CPUs will always be a tough sell for gamers now that its Ryzen 3D V-Cache models are expected to launch a few months after each initial release, as happened with the Ryzen 7000 Series and the older Ryzen 7 5800X3D. Unless AMD decides to combine the two ranges into a single 3D V-Cache range, this trend will continue, but what will be interesting to see is the performance difference outside of games.\n\nIn the past we've seen an ever-decreasing gap between performance of 3D V-Cache models and standard models, meaning if content creation performance is also important, you don't loose too much by optiong for a 3D V-Cache model and its slightly lower frequencies.\n\nI'll be reviewing the new Ryzen 9000 CPUs next week so follow me here on Forbes using the blue button below, Facebook or YouTube to get the latest news, analysis benchmarks.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts_Legacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hogwarts Legacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberpunk 2077"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Warzone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty: Warzone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1440p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1440p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Wake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counter-Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a0c0de880ec0796f63823d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

It is also splitting the launch schedule, with the Ryzen 9 9950X and 9900X launching on 15th August and Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X a week earlier on 8th August.\n\nQuestions around the availability of review samples were being raised this week, with the launch just a week away and no samples for reviewers in sight. Usually they are handed out around two or three weeks before a launch to give reviewers enough time to benchmark. The company reached out to journalists earlier today to explain why - a somewhat refreshing change from Intel's secretive handling of its current stability issues.\n\nIt seems that issues have arisen during testing of the first batch of new CPUs and when asked, AMD stated that 'During our continuous validation of the initial production material an issue was discovered in our packaging test and validation system which could result in a small number of Ryzen 9000 processors not meeting our standards.'\n\nIt's currently replacing samples that have shipped to its channel partners and due to a knock-on effect with availability, review and retail samples won't be available in enough quantities to meet the demands of a July 31st launch.\n\nThe full statement from AMD can be found below.\n\n\"We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processors. During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations. Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units. As a result, there will be a short delay in retail availability.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors will now go on sale on August 8 and the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X processors will go on-sale on August 15. We pride ourselves in providing a high-quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series.\"\n\nFor now, AMD hasn't elaborated on what the issues actually were, but did stress there were no issues with the manufacturing process or the CPUs themselves. It initially mentioned the possibility of bringing the review schedule forwards depending on availability. This appears to be confirmed with a new statement arriving moments before this article's embargo expired with the new split embargo above.\n\nThe new CPUs landing are the Ryzen 9 9950X, 9900X, Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X, which have the same core counts as the Ryzen 7000 series. As yet there's no concrete pricing for the new models, though, expectations are they'll retail for similar prices to the previous generation's launch pricing.\n\nAMD should be commended for making this move. These things happen, but it's far better to meet the issues head-on and early and enthusiasts will likely appreciate that, even if it does mean waiting another couple of weeks for reviews and retail availability.

The Zen5 architecture represents the fifth generation of AMD's Zen series CPU microarchitectures, demonstrating the company's ongoing innovation in the processor market. The new Zen5 microarchitecture will power the AMD Ryzen 9000 series processors for desktops, the Ryzen AI 300 series Strix Point processors for notebooks, and the 5th Gen EPYC Turin server processors. We dive into the ZEN5 architecture and talk a little about the Desktop and laptop parts.\n\nRyzen 9000\n\nAMD announced the launch of its Ryzen 9000 desktop CPU series, scheduled for release in late July 2024. This next-generation series utilizes the Zen5 architecture, generating significant interest following various leaks and reports. The series includes the Ryzen 9 9950X, Ryzen 9 9900X, 7900X, and 9600X, all part of the \"Granite Ridge\" lineup. Zen 5 represents the fifth generation of AMD's Zen CPU microarchitectures, marking a significant milestone in AMD's resurgence in the processor market. The new Zen 5 microarchitecture underpins the AMD Ryzen 9000 series \"Granite Ridge\" processors for desktops, the Ryzen AI 300 series \"Strix Point\" processors for notebooks, and the 5th Gen EPYC \"Turin\" processors for servers. The Zen5 architecture introduces optimizations that result in higher instructions per cycle (IPC), lower latency, and better overall system performance. For the mobile/laptop Strix Point products the inclusion of AI acceleration features is particularly noteworthy, aiming to enhance machine learning tasks and other AI-driven applications.\n\nYou're at Guru3D, so we'll first look into the desktop parts. The Ryzen 9 9950X, positioned as the flagship model, offers a significant performance boost with its higher core and thread count, making it suitable for demanding applications such as gaming, content creation, and professional workloads. The Ryzen 9 9900X and 7900X provide balanced options for users seeking high performance without reaching the flagship model's price point. The 9600X offers an entry point into the high-performance segment, delivering excellent value for its specifications. Further down the lineup, the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X are also confirmed, featuring 8 and 6 Zen5 cores respectively. The 9700X will operate at up to 5.5 GHz with a 40MB cache and a TDP of 65 watts, while the 9600X will have a max clock of 5.4 GHz, a 38MB cache, and the same 65 watts TDP. All processors in this series will support AMD's AM5 socket platform. In addition to the processors, AMD is expected to launch new X870 and B850 motherboards that will accommodate the AM5 socket. These new boards are anticipated to debut at the Computex event, where AMD will likely showcase them alongside the new CPU series. This event will also see the unveiling of the Intel Z890 series, indicating a significant period for advancements in desktop computing hardware. The adjustments in TDP across the new Ryzen models, with reductions ranging from 40 to 50 watts compared to their predecessors, point towards improved power efficiency -- a key focus in the latest generation of AMD processors. These developments suggest that AMD is continuing to prioritize enhancements in performance and efficiency to maintain competitiveness with other leading chip manufacturers.\n\nCPU Cores Max Clock L2+L3 Cache iGPU TDP AMD Ryzen For Desktop\n\nRyzen 9 9950X 16x Zen5 5.7 GHz 80MB 2CU RDNA2 170W Ryzen 9 9900X 12x Zen5 5.6 GHz 76MB 2CU RDNA2 120W Ryzen 7 9700X 8x Zen5 5.5 GHz 40MB 2CU RDNA2 65W Ryzen 5 9600X 6x Zen5 5.4 GHz 38MB 2CU RDNA2 65W\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X will become the new flagship processor, which will feature 16 cores and 32 threads, achieving boost speeds up to 5.7 GHz. Uniquely, this processor will operate with a Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 170 watts and will include 80MB of total cache.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X, another high-end SKU, will offer 12 cores and 24 threads with a boost capability of up to 5.6 GHz. It will have a reduced TDP of 120 watts compared to its predecessor and include 76MB of cache, marking a significant adjustment in power efficiency. Both of these Ryzen 9 models maintain the core count and clock speeds seen in the preceding Zen4 series but show enhancements in energy consumption and thermal management. This suggests AMD's ongoing dedication to improving power efficiency without sacrificing performance.\n\nMoving to the mid-range offerings, the Ryzen 7 9700X will feature 8 cores and 16 threads with a maximum boost speed of 5.5 GHz and a notably lower TDP of 65 watts. It will come equipped with 40MB of cache. This marks a 100 MHz increase in boost speed over previous models while significantly decreasing the power requirement from 105 watts in earlier versions. The entry-level Ryzen 5 9600X will include 6 cores and boost up to 5.4 GHz. Like the 9700X, it will also maintain a TDP of 65 watts. This model is designed to offer robust performance for mainstream users and gamers looking for a balance between power and thermal efficiency.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe processors are engineered to provide an average Instruction Per Cycle (IPC) performance improvement of 16 percent over the previous Zen 4 architecture. This enhancement implies that the Zen 5 chips are designed to be 16 percent more efficient at the same clock speeds and core counts, contingent upon specific workloads. Unlike the incremental updates often seen between previous Zen iterations, AMD characterizes Zen 5 as a substantive leap forward from Zen 4.\n\nSeveral architectural improvements have been implemented to achieve this advancement. Among these, AMD has optimized the branch prediction accuracy and reduced its latency, to improve the processor's efficiency in predicting the direction of a branch instruction before it is confirmed. AMD also enhanced the throughput capabilities by expanding the pipelines and vector sizes, which facilitates the handling of more data simultaneously and improves the core's parallel processing ability. Furthermore, Zen 5 processors are reported to have enlarged window sizes that allow for more instructions in the pipeline, enhancing the overall computational throughput.\n\nIn terms of data handling, AMD let us know that the Zen 5 architecture doubles the bandwidth for front-end instructions. This enhancement is also reflected in the increased data transfer rates between the L1 and L2 caches and from L1 cache to the floating-point (FP) unit, which should notably boost the processor's efficiency in handling complex computations and data-intensive tasks.\n\nAMD's latest branch predictor in the Zen 5 architecture aims to reduce latency and enhance accuracy, thereby improving overall throughput. Lower latency enables the CPU to access and process branch prediction data more swiftly. Enhanced accuracy reduces mispredictions, conserving CPU resources. Given the Zen 5's wider core design, the increased branch predictor throughput is essential for upholding optimal performance. The additional decode pipeline further supports this objective by ensuring efficient data flow. Zen 5 introduces an 8-wide dispatch, a noteworthy improvement over the 6-wide dispatch of previous Zen architectures. This expansion allows Zen 5 CPU cores to handle more operations concurrently, provided they receive adequate data.", "source": {"uri": "guru3d.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guru3D.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilbert_hagedoorn@guru3d.com", "name": "Hilbert Hagedoorn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microarchitecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RDNA 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyc", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epyc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Distributed_Projects", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Distributed Projects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.guru3d.com/data/publish/223/7d7377d2f81f735e127ff085d6484ac1b6b710/2024_07_23_09_46_08_guru3d.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The first Zen 5 architecture-based desktop chips were slated to launch next week, on July 31. But citing quality issues that are significant enough that AMD is even pulling back stock already sent to distributors, AMD is delaying the launch by one to two weeks. The Ryzen 9000 launch will now be a staggered launch, with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X launching on August 8, while the Ryzen 9 9900X and flagship Ryzen 9 9950X will launch a week after that, on August 15.\n\nThe exceptional announcement, officially coming from AMD's SVP and GM of Computing and Graphics, Jack Huynh, is short and to the point. Ahead of the launch, AMD found that \"the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations.\" And, as a result, the company has needed to delay the launch in order to rectify the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, because AMD had already distributed chips to their channel partners - distributors who then filter down to retailers and system builders - this is technically a recall as well, as AMD needs to pull back the first batch of chips and replace them with known good units. That AMD has to essentially take a do-over on initial chip distribution is ultimately what's driving this delay; it takes the better part of a month to properly seed retailers for a desktop CPU launch with even modest chip volumes, so AMD has to push the launch out to give their supply chain time to catch up.\n\nFor the moment, there are no further details on what the quality issue with the first batch of chips is, how many are affected, or what any kind of fix may entail. Whatever the issue is, AMD is simply taking back all stock and replacing it with what they're calling \"fresh units.\"\n\nImportantly, however, this announcement is only for the Ryzen 9000 desktop processors, and not the Ryzen AI 300 mobile processors (Strix Point), which are still slated to launch next week. A mobile chip recall would be a much bigger issue (they're in finished devices that would need significant labor to rework), but also, both the new desktop and mobile Ryzen processors are being made on the same TSMC N4 process node, and have significant overlap in their CPU structures. To be sure, mobile and desktop are very different dies, but it does strongly imply that whatever the issue is, it's not a design flaw or a fabrication flaw in the silicon itself.\n\nThat AMD is able to re-stage the launch of the desktop Ryzen 9000 chips so quickly - on the order of a few weeks - further points to an issue much farther down the line. If indeed the issue isn't at the silicon level, then that leaves packaging and testing as the next most likely culprit. Whether that means AMD's packaging partners had some kind of issue assembling the multi-die chips, or if AMD found some other issue that warrants further checks remains to be seen. But it will definitely be interesting to eventually find out the backstory here. In particular I'm curious if AMD is being forced to throw out the first batch of Ryzen 9000 desktop chips entirely, or if they just need to send them through an additional round of QA to pull bad chips.\n\nIt's also interesting here that AMD's new launch schedule has essentially split the Ryzen 9000 stack in two. The company's higher-end chips, which incorporate two CCDs, are delayed an additional week over the lower-end units with their single CCD. By their very nature, multi-CCD chips require more time to validate (there's a whole additional die to test), but they also require more CCDs to assemble. So it's a toss-up right now whether the additional week for the high-end chips is due to a supply bottleneck, or a chip testing bottleneck.\n\nThe silver lining to all of this, at least, is that AMD found the issue before any of the faulty chips made their ways into the hands of consumers. Though the need to re-stage the launch still throws a rather large wrench into marketing efforts of AMD and their partners, a post-launch recall would have been far more disastrous on multiple levels, not to mention that it would have given the company a significant black eye. Something that arch-rival Intel is getting to experience for themselves this week.\n\nIn any case, this will certainly go down as one of the more interesting AMD desktop chip launches - and the chips haven't actually made it out the door yet. We'll have more on the subject as further details are released. And look forward to chip reviews soon - just not on July 31 as originally planned.", "source": {"uri": "anandtech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anandtech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_smith@anandtech.com", "name": "Ryan Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5 nm process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charge-coupled device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_device_fabrication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor device fabrication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottleneck_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bottleneck (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Call stack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://images.anandtech.com/doci/21489/Ryzen-9000_4-(1)_678x452.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759285", "eventUri": "eng-9759285", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 202, "textEnd": 209, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 487, "textEnd": 495}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 582, "textEnd": 591}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The latest listings come from European retailer, Azerty, a major outlet for Netherlands & Belgium.\n\nThe retailer listed three AMD Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" Desktop CPUs for a brief period after which the listings were removed when the retailer found out that they were probably breaking the embargo for the chips which is to not disclose any pricing information before the 31st July release date.

This new processor enhances its NPU (Neural Processing Unit) computing power from the 50 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) seen in other Strix Point models to 55 TOPS. The total AI computing power of the chip has increased from 80 TOPS to 85 TOPS. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 features a 12-core design, consisting of 4 Zen 5 cores and 8 Zen 5c cores, with a maximum acceleration frequency of 5.1 GHz. It also includes a 16 CU RDNA 3.5 Radeon 890M core graphics card. Aside from the increased NPU computing power, other specifications remain consistent with the Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 model.\n\nIn comparison, the core configuration of the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 offers improved performance, particularly in AI-related tasks, due to its enhanced NPU capabilities. The integrated graphics and high core count ensure robust performance for both general and specialized computing needs. Earlier, IT Home reported that HP, during the launch of its OmniBook Ultra notebook on July 15, mentioned that the NPU of its Ryzen AI 300 series processor reached a maximum AI computing power of 55 TOPS. Although the specific model was not disclosed, it is anticipated that the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 processor, now available on AMD's website, is the model referred to. This release marks a significant step for AMD in advancing its AI processing capabilities in mobile processors. The increased NPU power positions the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 as a strong contender in the market for AI-intensive applications, offering enhanced performance for machine learning, data analysis, and other AI-driven tasks.

In 2020, the EU imposed sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for the APT28 attacks targeting the German Federal Parliament in 2015.\n\n\"The malicious cyber campaign shows Russia's continuous pattern of irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace, by targeting democratic institutions, government entities and critical infrastructure providers across the European Union and beyond. This type of behaviour is contrary to the UN norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, such as impairing the use and operation of critical infrastructure. Disregarding international security and stability, Russia has repeatedly leveraged APT28 to conduct malicious cyber activities against the EU, its Member States and international partners, most notably Ukraine,\" according to the statement.\n\nIn this regard, the High Representative assured that the EU \"will not tolerate such malicious behaviour, particularly activities that aim to degrade our critical infrastructure, weaken societal cohesion and influence democratic processes, mindful of this year's elections in the EU and in more than 60 countries around the world. The EU and its Member States will continue to cooperate with our international partners to promote an open, free, stable and secure cyberspace,\" Borrell said.", "source": {"uri": "en.interfax.com.ua", "dataType": "news", "title": "Interfax-Ukraine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josep_Borrell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josep Borrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fancy Bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advanced persistent threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundestag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Internet_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Internet Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.interfax.com.ua/media/thumbs/images/2022/04/F_nv4oQAQSlu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536569", "eventUri": "eng-9536569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The EU is determined to make use of the full spectrum of measures to prevent, deter and respond to Russia's malicious behaviour in cyber space.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the German government said: \"Cyber attacks against political parties, state institutions and companies that provide critical infrastructure pose a threat to our democracy, our national security and our liberal-minded society.\n\n\"The Federal Government most strongly condemns the repeated and unacceptable malicious cyber activities by state-sponsored Russian actors and again calls on Russia to refrain from such behaviour. Germany is determined to work together with its European and international partners to counter such malicious cyber activities.\"\n\nThe Czechian government added: \"Cyber attacks targeting political entities, state institutions and critical infrastructure are not only a threat to national security, but also disrupt the democratic processes on which our free society is based. Czech authorities will continue to take steps to strengthen the resilience of public institutions and the private sector.\n\n\"Czechia is deeply concerned by these repeated cyber attacks by state actors,\" it said. \"We are determined to respond strongly to this unacceptable behaviour together with our European and international partners.\"\n\nIn both campaigns against Czechia and Germany, APT28 is understood to have exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook. This is likely to have been CVE-2023-23397, which was disclosed in the March 2023 Patch Tuesday update, and which Fancy Bear is known to have used in a great number of cyber attacks, possibly as long ago as 2022.\n\nIt has also been used against government bodies and organisations in fields such as energy production and distribution; pipeline operations; and materiel, personal and air transport.\n\nThe targeted countries were Bulgaria, Czechia, Italy, Jordan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, T\u00fcrkiye, Ukraine, the UAE and the US, as well as the Nato High Readiness Force Headquarters, which are dispersed across Europe in the UK, France, Germany, Greece, Poland and T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nCVE-2023-23397, which is exploited by sending a specially crafted email to a potential target, is particularly dangerous because it is triggered on the email server side, which in layman's terms means it can be exploited before the email is opened and viewed. It enables a threat actor to access the victim's Net-NTLMv2 hash and use it to authenticate while pretending to be them, thus getting around authentication measures. It was first discovered by Ukrainian cyber authorities.", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a Friday press conference, Baerbock said the attack was \"completely unacceptable and will not remain without consequences.\"\n\nBaerbock, in a speech at a press conference with the Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs, declared that the \"serious cyber attack against the members of the Social Democratic Party\" in 2023 was carried out by the APT28 group. The Federal Government, under leadership of the Federal Foreign Office, investigated the attack and attributed it to this group, who are controlled by the Russian military intelligence service GRU.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Berlin denied these accusations. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the Russian embassy stated that their ambassador was summoned to the federal foreign office on May 3rd, where they were accused of the 2023 cyber attack. The Russian embassy emphasized that they \"strongly denied these allegations\" and said that they lacked evidence. They further stated that \"the embassy views this as yet another unfriendly step aimed at creating anti-Russian sentiment in Germany, which will lead to a deterioration of Russo-German relations.\"\n\nThe attacks were condemned by the US State Department as \"malicious.\" The US have previously sanctioned actors associated with APT28 for their involvement in a \"range of malign cyber activity.\" They criticized Russia's disregard of the UN Framework for Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace and expressed their support for Germany:\n\nThe United States is committed to the security of our allies and partners and upholding the rules-based international order, including in cyberspace. We call on Russia to stop this malicious activity and abide by its international commitments and obligations. With the EU and our NATO Allies, we will continue to take action to disrupt Russia's cyber activities, protect our citizens and foreign partners, and hold malicious actors accountable.\n\nRecent cyber attacks on Czechia have also been attributed to APT28. NATO affirmed their solidarity with both countries in a statement from the North Atlantic Council. They noted that Russian military organizations had also conducted cyber attacks on Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Sweden and condemned these \"malicious cyber activities intended to undermine our democratic institutions, national security and free society.\" NATO affirmed they are dedicated to \"countering the substantial, continuous and increasing cyber threat\" and called on all states to \"respect their international obligations and commitments to uphold international law.\"", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It also initially remained unclear how many email accounts were targeted and how much data was siphoned off.\n\nSPD General Secretary Kevin K\u00fchnert stated that there were \"well-founded indications that the attack was carried out by attackers from Russia.\"\n\nAccording to Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, the German government's investigation into the incident - known in diplomatic jargon as \"attribution proceedings\" - is now complete.\n\n\"We can now clearly attribute this attack from last year to the APT28 group, which is controlled by the Russian secret service GRU,\" said the minister. \"This is completely unacceptable and will not remain without consequences.\"\n\nNeither Baerbock nor a government spokesman said on Friday what these consequences might be. The German government once again called on Russia to refrain from such actions.\n\nRussia's irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace is contrary to international norms and deserves special attention in a year with elections in many countries, Berlin said. Cyberattacks against political parties, state institutions and critical infrastructure companies are a threat to democracy, national security and a free society, it said.\n\nThe European Union has previously imposed sanctions against individuals or organizations in similar cases. Travel bans or the freezing of assets are conceivable.\n\nThe bloc \"is determined to make use of the full spectrum of measures to prevent, deter and respond to Russia's malicious behaviour in cyberspace,\" read an EU statement, issued by EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrel on behalf of all 27 member states, on Friday.\n\n\"The malicious cyber campaign shows Russia's continuous pattern of irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace, by targeting democratic institutions, government entities and critical infrastructure providers across the European Union and beyond.\"\n\nThe NATO military alliance said: \"We stand in solidarity with Germany following the malicious cyber campaign against a political party, in this case the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and with Czechia following the malicious cyber activities against its institutions.\"\n\nAccording to the German domestic intelligence service, the APT28 group has been active worldwide since at least 2004, primarily in the field of cyber espionage. According to the Interior Ministry, it has also conducted disinformation and propaganda campaigns in the past and is \"one of the most active and dangerous cyber actors worldwide.\"\n\nAPT stands for Advanced Persistent Threat. This is how security authorities refer to groups controlled by authoritarian states that are tasked with systematically carrying out cyberattacks. Around 40 of these have been identified so far.\n\nGermany's domestic intelligence service clearly attributes APT28 to the Russian military intelligence service GRU.\n\nThe group was held responsible for a major cyberattack on the lower house of Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, in 2015 and later in the US for an attack on the Democratic Party before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe EU announced that it had already imposed sanctions in 2020 against individuals and organizations responsible for the APT28 attacks on the Bundestag.\n\nAccording to previous findings, the attack on the SPD was part of a campaign by APT28 targeting several European countries. According to the EU, state institutions, agencies and organizations in Poland, Lithuania, Slovakia and Sweden were also attacked by the same \"threat actor\".\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in Berlin on Friday that she is determined to counter Russian cyberattacks in Germany.\n\n\"Under no circumstances will we allow ourselves to be intimidated by the Russian regime. We will continue to provide massive support to Ukraine, which is defending itself against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's murderous war,\" the SPD politician said.\n\nThe security authorities had ramped up all protective measures against hybrid threats and were well networked internationally, she said. \"This year, with the European elections and other elections, we must arm ourselves particularly well against hacker attacks, manipulation and disinformation,\" said Faeser.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The United States has previously indicted and sanctioned actors associated with APT28 for their involvement in a wide range of malicious cyber activities, including cyber activities intended to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election, and ongoing operations hacking and leaks targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) aimed at undermining and casting doubt on the organization's integrity.\n\nThe US Department of Justice worked with Germany to patch a network of hundreds of small office/home office routers that APT28 was using to hide and conduct malicious activities, including exploiting CVE-2023-23397 against targets in Germany. The DOJ's action further blocked the GRU from regaining access to the redacted devices.\n\nRussia's pattern of behavior blatantly disregards the Framework for Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace, as affirmed by all United Nations Member States.

We will continue to provide massive support to Ukraine, which is defending itself against Putin's murderous war,\" the SPD politician said.\n\nFaeser said that the attacks were not only aimed at individual parties or specific politicians, but also at shaking confidence in democracy. Germany is now acting together with other EU states, NATO and international partners, she said.\n\nThe security authorities had ramped up all protective measures against hybrid threats and were well networked internationally, she said. \"This year, with the European elections and other elections, we must arm ourselves particularly well against hacker attacks, manipulation and disinformation,\"

In 2008, it targeted Georgia and to this day, according to the European Court of Human Rights, maintains \"direct control\" over the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Akhbazia (on the Black Stea). This was also the first war ever, in which cyber warfare coincided with military action.\n\nIn 2014, it occupied the Crimean peninsula before, almost a decade later, occupying parts of Eastern Ukraine, also on the Black Sea.

The couple, who met in a takeaway in Rusholme, Manchester, fourteen years ago, welcomed their daughter Nora on March 30. Despite a frantic dash to the hospital, Nora's birth at 3am was thankfully straightforward, with the newborn weighing just over 7lb. Recalling her labour, Paige, 32, previously said: \"I said from the beginning that I wanted a vaginal birth, and that's what happened. I started having contractions around two days before Nora was born, but the position that she was in also meant she was pushing on my back, causing nerve pain.\" READ MORE: BBC Strictly Come Dancing's Amy Dowden says she 'can't believe' it as she marks major 'first' after cancer surgery Join our WhatsApp Top Stories and Breaking News group by clicking this link Describing the intense pain, she continued to OK!: \"That was awful I almost felt paralysed at one point. The pain was intense, so we rushed to the hospital. The doctors wanted to examine the nerve issue first but there was no time, I could feel Nora coming. I had no time for any extra pain relief, so it was just gas and air. I was offered an epidural, which I considered but I ended up not having one. The minute she was born it was as if my body forgot about the horrendous pain I was in. It was all worth it.\" And the little one has already made her TV debut alongside her mum on the ITVBe show. It's now been revealed that baby Nora will once again feature in Monday night's (June 10) episode of RHOC as she has her own Aqiqah. The Aqiqah is a Muslim tradition where the baby\u2019s head is shaved as a symbol of purification. It is seen as a celebration of birth and acts as the official announcement of the baby\u2019s full name, Nora Aleena Chohan. The Aqiqah is part of the Sunnah (tradition) of the prophet, in Islam, where \u2013 as well as enjoying a feast as a family \u2013 the newborn baby\u2019s hair is shaved. Shaving the hair is a symbol of purity and cleanliness. Some also believe that the process of shaving the baby\u2019s hair encourages it to grow back thicker and healthier. Amir\u2019s longtime friend and barber performed the shaving of Nora\u2019s hair, which was then weighed so that the family could give the equivalent value in gold, to charity. Speaking about sharing what is an intimate rite of passage in the Muslim community, Paige told the Manchester Evening News: \"The Aqiqah was a wonderful experience for our family and an important tradition for us to observe, as part of our faith. I feel proud to have shared this experience on the show and hope that people enjoy glimpsing this intimate family moment, celebrating our baby girl.\" The new mum also opened up about what it's like having a daughter and how it has impacted her faith, telling us: \"It's been a blessing to have Nora. I thought I knew what love was before her, but having Nora opened my heart to such immeasurable levels, she reminds me daily what love and happiness truly means. I\u2019m beyond obsessed! \"Having Nora has really made me feel so connected to my faith. I want to learn more so that I can pass that knowledge on to Nora to enjoy as well. Being Nora\u2019s mum is such a gift - it really feels like a spiritual experience.\" Amir, 35, added of being a first-time dad and what the future may hold for the family-of-three: \"Becoming a dad has made me develop an incredible appreciation for Paige. She was like a super woman giving birth to our beautiful girl, Nora and created our new family of three. \"Hopefully more babies will be added in the future too! It\u2019s made me more determined than ever to want to support our family and Nora has made me see life through an entirely different lens.\" The Real Housewives of Cheshire is available to stream now on ITVX or you can watch the next episode on ITVBe on Monday, June 10, at 9pm.", "summary": "EXCLUSIVE: The new mum has let cameras in on the moving moment after welcoming a baby girl with husband Amir", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/real-housewives-cheshire-star-paige-29322098", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29322230.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JSR_MEN_090624_PaigeChohan_02jpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:16:34", "author": "Jessica Sansome", "authors": ["Jessica Sansome"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.213}

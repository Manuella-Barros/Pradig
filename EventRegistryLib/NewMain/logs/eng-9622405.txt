After losing badly in two consecutive assembly elections and one Lok Sabha election, the party now appears to be making a remarkable comeback, securing 37 seats in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn 2019, the Samajwadi Party won only 5 seats in the country's largest state. The BJP, on the other hand, is leading on only 32 seats in the state against its mammoth target of 70. The BJP had won 62 seats out of the total 80 in the 2019 general election.\n\nSamajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has been campaigning with his PDA (Backward, Dalit and Minority) slogan in this election. Interestingly, this marks the SP's most impressive performance in Lok Sabha elections after Mulayam Singh Yadav's demise.\n\nThe manner in which Akhilesh Yadav incorporated caste equations into this election seems to have weakened the BJP's electoral calculations. The 1973-born Akhilesh Yadav has demonstrated a remarkable ability to rally support and mobilise his party's cadre, thereby playing a crucial role in shaping the regional and national political dynamics.\n\nWatching the trend, it seems that the Bahujan Samaj Party's vote bank also went in favour of the Congress and the SP.\n\nThe SP-Congress combine is projected to win 39 seats, while the BJP has 40 seats in its kitty.\n\nAkhilesh is leading by a margin of around 1,70,076 votes in the Kannauj constituency ahead of BJP's Subrat Pathak.\n\nHe has won from the Kannauj constituency -- which was also represented by his father, Mulayam Singh Yadav, before him -- three times. He held this seat from 2000 to 2012 when he vacated it after becoming the chief minister.\n\nYadav Parivar's association with Kannauj dates back to 1999 when the late Mulayam Singh Yadav won the seat. Since then, the seat has been held by a member of the family - either Akhilesh Yadav himself or his wife, Dimple Yadav - until 2019.\n\nAn SP bastion since 1998, the Kannauj Lok Sabha constituency was breached by the BJP in 2019, when Subrat Pathak won by a margin of about 12,000 votes, narrowly defeating Dimple Yadav, the wife of Akhilesh Yadav.\n\nToday, Dimple Yadav won the Mainpuri seat by a huge margin of 2,21,639 votes, defeating BJP's Jayveer Singh.\n\nAkhilesh's cousins Dharmendra Yadav and Akashaya Yadav, won from Azamgarh and Firozabad, respectively, while another party leader Aditya Yadav emerged victorious in Badaun.\n\nAfter maintaining suspense, Akhilesh filed nomination from the seat at the last moment to reclaim SP's strong areas from the BJP, which has made strong inroads in the past 10 years.\n\nYadav, who has been serving as the Leader of Opposition in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly since March 2022, obtained his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Mysore, Karnataka. He also holds a master's degree in environmental engineering from the University of Sydney, Australia.\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress sealed their pre-poll alliance for the Lok Sabha elections. As part of the pact, the Congress was offered 17 seats to contest in the state, while the remaining 63 went to the Samajwadi Party.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He has represented Kannauj three times in a row in 2000 (bypoll), 2004, and 2009.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahujan_Samaj_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bahujan Samaj Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulayam_Singh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mulayam Singh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrat_Pathak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subrat Pathak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannauj", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kannauj"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kannauj"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannauj_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kannauj Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimple_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dimple Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainpuri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainpuri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainpuri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Akhilesh-Yadav-Twitter-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622405", "eventUri": "eng-9622405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Since then, the seat has been helmed by a member of the family- either Akhilesh Yadav himself, or his wife, Dimple Yadav- until 2019.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the seat went to the Bharatiya Janata Party's Subrat Pathak, who defeated Dimple Yadav with a narrow margin of 1.08%.\n\nPathak received a vote share of 49.37%, while Dimple secured 48.29%.

In the recently concluded 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, the Samajwadi Party, a prominent member of the INDIA bloc, won a record-breaking 37 seats out of the total 80 Lok Sabha constituencies in Uttar Pradesh. This victory marks a significant moment for Akhilesh Yadav and the party leaders as they successfully broke the record for the most seats won in Parliament. In addition to winning the highest number of seats, the party's vote share also saw a significant jump, reaching 33.59% in UP.\n\nSP Lifts INDIA Bloc in fight against NDA\n\nWith this record figure, the SP has stolen the thunder for the INDIA bloc against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Notably, the Congress, which contested in alliance with the SP, also had a fair share of winning seats in the state, securing a total of six seats, including regaining control of the Amethi seat, previously won by BJP leader Smriti Irani in 2019. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which won a landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, however had to settle for 33 seats in the state this time, compared to their previous record of winning more than 60 seats.\n\nSP witnesses its best-ever performance\n\nThe Samajwadi Party contested its first Lok Sabha election in 1996, (after being formed in 1992), where the party won 16 Lok Sabha seats in UP with a vote share of 20.80%. In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, the party increased its support base and won 20 seats with a vote share of 28.7%. The party again saw significant gains in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, winning 26 seats. However, it was in 2004 that the party set a record by winning 35 seats, with 26.74% of the vote.\n\nSubsequent to its earlier gain, however the party again surfaced low in the 2009 elections, where their seats decreased to 23. Further, this similar trend has been witnessed in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections also, when the SP could win only five seats.\n\nSP gave tough competition to BJP in UP\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the SP gave tough competition to the BJP in UP, halving the BJP's seat count. Even where the SP lost, it often remained in second place. In many constituencies, the margin between victory and defeat was between 2,000 to 50,000 votes, and in some seats, the BJP won by less than 5,000 votes. The SP also defeated the BJP in Ayodhya, despite the BJP's nationwide campaign centered on the Ram Mandir.\n\nFive leaders of Mulayam's family became MPs\n\nNotably, five members of Mulayam Singh Yadav's family have become MPs. Akhilesh Yadav, his wife Dimple Yadav, cousin Akshay Yadav, Dharmendra Yadav, and Aditya Yadav have all won the Lok Sabha elections. Earlier, the Samajwadi Party president and newly elected MP from Kannauj, Akhilesh Yadav, received his election certificate on Wednesday from District Magistrate/District Election Officer Subhrant Kumar Shukla. In the election results declared on Tuesday, Akhilesh Yadav defeated his nearest rival, Subrata Pathak of the BJP, from the Kannauj seat by 170,922 votes. Yadav was first elected in the Kannauj Lok Sabha by-election in 2000.\n\nREAD MORE | Lok Sabha Election 2024: How did former CMs contesting polls perform?

This surge in the Samajwadi Party's seat count from 5 in 2019 to at least 33 in 2024 has been instrumental in the Opposition INDIA bloc's rise in Uttar Pradesh, with Akhilesh Yadav at the helm.\n\nBoth Akhilesh Yadav and his wife Dimple have showcased the SP's strong performance in Uttar Pradesh. Akhilesh Yadav is leading in Kannauj with a margin of 61,351 votes against BJP's Subrat Pathak, while Dimple Yadav is leading in Mainpuri with a margin of 68,261 votes against BJP's Jaiveer Singh, as per the Election Commission.

TMC's candidate Mahua Moitra from Krishnanagar is currently leading by a margin of over 65,000 votes. Furthermore, Abhishek Banerjee has extended his lead to over 3 lakh votes in Diamond Harbour, and TMC's candidate Shatrughan Sinha is leading in Asansol by a margin of over 36,000 votes.\n\nKarnataka\n\nThe Congress in Karnataka has experienced a significant increase in vote share, rising by 13% from 32% to 45%. On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has declined from 51% to 44%. Despite contesting in only 3 seats as opposed to 7 in 2019, the JD(S) has performed admirably, securing 8% of the vote compared to the previous 10%.\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nIn Madhya Pradesh, the BJP has successfully held onto its stronghold, leading in all 29 seats. However, the trends are worrisome for the Congress as their only Member of Parliament (MP) from Chhindwara, Nakul Nath, is currently falling behind in the race.\n\nBihar\n\nThe BJP managed to regain the support of their former ally, JDU led by Nitish Kumar. Currently, the NDA alliance holds 31 seats, while the opposition's INDIA bloc has 9 seats.

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\nAs the trends came in, the SP was leading on 34 seats as against the BJP's 36 seats.\n\nThe tally is a spoiler for the BJP which had claimed it will sweep the state from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an MP.\n\nFrom winning five seats in the last election in partnership with the Bahujan Samaj Party, Akhilesh's party in UP has dealt a bodyblow to the BJP, which had in 2019 won 62 seats on its own.\n\nBorn on July 1, 1973, Akhilesh led the opposition's campaign from the front in the key political state, pairing well with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's outfit.\n\nThis was the first general election after the death of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Akhilesh did not disappoint, to the extent, it now leads on more seats than won in the 2004 election.\n\nThe turnaround for the opposition came even as Akhilesh, along with Rahul Gandhi, was disparaged as 'Do ladko ki jodi' often by Modi.\n\nThe acronym PDA -- Pichchde (backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities) -- coined by Akhilesh appears to have worked for the party.\n\nAt the latest count, the SP was ahead of the BJP even on the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat, despite Ram temple in Ayodhya being a talking point for the saffron party throughout the run-up to the election.\n\nTMC, another Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance bloc member, was given the Bhadohi Lok Sabha seat in UP.\n\nAkhilesh in his speeches decried the ruling dispensation's jailing Arvind Kejriwal, as well as Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Hemant Soren, to highlights the BJP's putative highhandedness.\n\nHe praised Lalu Prasad and his son Tejaswi Yadav, who were charge in of holding the alliance's fort in Bihar.\n\nIn the fray from Kannauj Lok Sabha seat, Akhilesh took it upon him to drum up support for his wife Dimple Yadav, and three cousins, who all are in the fray.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Akhilesh forced the BJP to recalibrate its narrative, somewhat even sending it on a backfoot, when he retorted to the ruling party's jibe of nepotism, saying those with no family had no right to call out others.\n\nThe rebuttal sent entire BJP brass, as well as grassroots workers, to append 'Modi ka Parivaar' in their social media bios.\n\nThe party's performance also indicates a strong support from the state's Muslim population, a substantial chunk of the total.\n\nAhead of the election, Akhilesh forged a rapprochement with uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, who helped the party reach out to its traditional voters, most of them from the Yadav caste, spread over in the eastern and central parts of the state.\n\nA break from its former partner Bahujan Samaj Party did no harm to the SP, which called it 'B-team' of the BJP.\n\nThe SP had given 18 seats to Congress, one to TMC, and had fielded its own candidates in the rest of the total 80 constituencies.\n\nBorn in the Yadavs native village of Saifai in Etawah district, Akhilesh Yadav studied at the Dholpur Military School in Rajasthan.\n\nHe got his Bachelor's degree in environmental engineering from Mysore University and followed it up by doing Masters from Sydney.\n\nIn 2000, he was elected to the Lok Sabha in a bye-election from Kannauj. He won again in 2004 and 2009.\n\nAs Uttar Pradesh chief minister, in a departure from the party's earlier stance aghast computers, he launched the 'biggest laptop distribution' scheme for students.\n\nHis government also took credit for launching development projects like the Agra-Lucknow expressway, metro project, international stadium and cancer hospital in Lucknow.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav

He won again in 2004 and 2009.\n\nAs Uttar Pradesh chief minister, in a departure from the party's earlier stance aghast computers, he launched the \"biggest laptop distribution\" scheme for students.\n\nHis government also took credit for launching development projects like the Agra-Lucknow expressway, metro project, international stadium and cancer hospital in Lucknow.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav

either winning or leading in their respective constituencies.\n\nMost prominent among them are the family members of the two former chief ministers -- Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav in Bihar and Samajwadi Party (SP) founder Late Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh -- and former prime minister and JD(S) chief H D Deve Gowda in Karnataka.\n\nAlso Read | Andhra Pradesh Lok

Yadav is leading with 1.7 lakh votes in Kannauj against BJP's Subrat Pathak.\n\nAkhilesh's wife Dimple Yadav has secured a comfortable winning margin of 2.2 lakh in Mainpuri against her nearest rival BJP's Jayveer Singh.\n\nThe SP chief's three cousins -- Akshay Yadav, Dharmendra Yadav and Aditya Yadav -- are also contesting the elections.\n\nWhile Akshay is leading with over 89,000 votes against BJP's Vishwadeep Singh in Firozabad, Dharmendra too has achieved a decisive margin of over 1.6 lakh votes in Azamgarh.\n\nIf Aditya, who is locked in a close contest with BJP's Durvijay Singh Shakya in Badaun, secures a good vote margin, this would be one of the most successful elections for the Yadav family in the recent times.\n\nTwo of Gowda's family members have registered victories in the elections, while his grandson, Prajwal Revanna, lost from the Hassan parliamentary constituency.\n\nThe JD(S) chief's son H D Kumaraswamy won the Mandya seat defeating Congress' Venkataramane Gowda by a margin of over 2.8 lakh votes and Gowda's son-in-law and BJP candidate Manjunath secured the Bangalore Rural seat defeating Congress' DK Suresh by over 2.6 lakh votes.\n\nRevanna, who is facing

Initially, Tej Pratap Yadav was nominated to contest the Kannauj seat, but the party later changed the decision due to dissatisfaction among party workers who preferred the SP Chief as the candidate.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simran_rajpal@news24online.com", "name": "Simran Rajpal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannauj", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannauj"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kannauj"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrat_Pathak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subrat Pathak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tej_Pratap_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tej Pratap Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://news24online.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Akhilesh-Yadav.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622405", "eventUri": "eng-9622405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Akhilesh Yadav's stock rose dramatically on Tuesday with his Samajwadi Party cutting the ruling BJP down to size in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nLucknow, Jun 4 (PTI) Akhilesh Yadav's stock rose dramatically on Tuesday with his Samajwadi Party cutting the ruling BJP down to size in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAs the trends came in, the SP was leading on 33 seats as against the BJP's 36 seats.\n\nAlso Read | Parade of Planets 2024: Six Planets of Solar System To Align in Straight Line Today, Know Time and How To Watch Rare Planetary Alignment in India.\n\nThe tally is a spoiler for the BJP which had claimed it will sweep the state from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is an MP.\n\nFrom winning five seats in the last election in partnership with the BSP, Akhilesh's party in UP has dealt a bodyblow to the BJP, which had in 2019 won 62 seats on its own.\n\nAlso Read | JIPMAT 2024 Admit Card Out at exams.nta.ac.in: Hall Ticket for JIPMAT Examination on June 6 Released, Know Steps To Download.\n\nBorn on July 1, 1973, Akhilesh led the opposition's campaign from the front in the key political state, pairing well with Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress and Arvind Kejriwal's outfit.\n\nThis was the first general election after the death of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, and Akhilesh did not disappoint, to the extent, it now leads on more seats than won in the 2004 election.\n\nThe turnaround for the opposition came even as Akhilesh, along with Rahul Gandhi, was disparaged as \"Do ladko ki jodi\" often by Modi.\n\nThe acronym PDA -- Pichchde (backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities) - coined by Akhilesh appears to have worked for the party.\n\nAt the latest count, the SP was ahead of the BJP even on the Faizabad Lok Sabha seat, despite Ram temple in Ayodhya being a talking point for the saffron party throughout the run-up to the election.\n\nTMC, another INDIA bloc ally, was given the Bhadohi Lok Sabha seat in UP.\n\nAkhilesh in his speeches decried the ruling dispensation's jailing Arvind Kejriwal, as well as JMM leader Hemant Soren, to highlights the BJP's putative highhandedness.\n\nHe praised Lalu Prasad and his son Tejaswi Yadav, who were charge in of holding the alliance's fort in Bihar.\n\nIn the fray from Kannauj Lok Sabha seat, Akhilesh took it upon him to drum up support for his wife Dimple Yadav, and three cousins, who all are in the fray.\n\nEarlier in the campaign, Akhilesh forced the BJP to recalibrate its narrative, somewhat even sending it on a backfoot, when he retorted to the ruling party's jibe of nepotism, saying those with no family had no right to call out others.\n\nThe rebuttal sent entire BJP brass, as well as grassroots workers, to append \"Modi ka Parivaar\" in their social media bios.\n\nThe party's performance also indicates a strong support from the state's Muslim population, a substantial chunk of the total.\n\nAhead of the election, Akhilesh forged a rapprochement with uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, who helped the party reach out to its traditional voters, most of them from the Yadav caste, spread over in the eastern and central parts of the state.\n\nA break from its former partner Bahujan Samaj Party did no harm to the SP, which called it \"B-team\" of the BJP.\n\nThe SP had given 18 seats to Congress, one to TMC, and had fielded its own candidates in the rest of the total 80 constituencies.\n\nBorn in the Yadavs native village of Saifai in Etawah district, Akhilesh Yadav studied at the Dholpur Military School in Rajasthan.\n\nHe got his Bachelor's degree in environmental engineering from Mysore University and followed it up by doing Masters from Sydney.\n\nIn 2000, he was elected to the Lok Sabha in a bye-election from Kannauj. He won again in 2004 and 2009.\n\nAs Uttar Pradesh chief minister, in a departure from the party's earlier stance aghast computers, he launched the \"biggest laptop distribution\" scheme for students.\n\nHis government also took credit for launching development projects like the Agra-Lucknow expressway, metro project, international stadium and cancer hospital in Lucknow.\n\nAkhilesh Yadav

It is also the constituency from where SP founder and former CM Mulayam Singh Yadav won five times. While Mulayam won Mainpuri for the first time in 1996, SP's Balram Yadav won the seat twice between 1998 and 1999. Mulayam then won the seat four times between 2004 and 2019.\n\nAfter Mulayam's demise in October 2022 affected a bypoll, Dimple fought from the seat and won it by defeating BJP's Raghuraj Singh Shakya by a margin of 2,88,461 votes.\n\nThe 2022 win also brought the feuding family members of the SP's first family together as Mulayam's younger brother Shivpal Yadav returned to the SP fold and Akhilesh welcomed him in the party by handing over the 'cycle' symbol of the SP on 8 December when the results were announced.\n\nAccording to political experts, the 2024 win establishes the influence of the first Yadav family in Mainpuri and other SP strongholds such as Kannauj, Firozabad, Budaun and Azamgarh.\n\nSpeaking to ThePrint, Mirza Asmer Beg, a political science professor at Aligarh Muslim University, said that Dimple's lead shows that the first family of SP has been able to retain its strongholds and that the public of Mainpuri has sided with the Yadav family after Mulayam's demise.\n\n\"Akhilesh and his wife Dimple have managed to retain their strongholds despite facing massive competition from the BJP. This only shows that they have been able to carry forward the family legacy in their strongholds such as Mainpuri. Even if Akhilesh vacates Kannauj for a bigger role in national politics, he would like to keep the seat within the family,\" he said.\n\nT.P. Singh, a political science professor at the Banaras Hindu University, said that Dimple's win is significant because she contested this election mostly on her own while campaigning for other party candidates.\n\n\"With SP leading on 35 seats, less than half of the seats in UP, Akhilesh is set for a national role.

It was here in Etah that former CM late Kalyan Singh got record votes as independent candidate in 2009 Lok Sabha election with support of Late Mulayam Singh Yadav.\n\nAfter 16 % Lodh voters, Etah has dominant Yadav voters (14%) but Devendra Singh Yadav was contesting for SP in Etah, and the BJP failed to make inroads among Yadavs remaining loyal to SP. Akhilesh Yadav, working on PDA (Backward, Dalit, Minority) chose candidate from Shakya community having 8% vote share in Etah instead of candidate from Yadav community comprising 14 % voters in Etah.\n\nThe most successful candidate in Etah in the past was late Mahadeepak Singh Shakya who had won six times from the seat , once for Lok Dal and at other times for the saffron party. The election result reflects remaining part of success story as BSP candidate, Mohd Irfan, a local advocate got only 71585 votes indicating shift of majority of BSP traditional Jatav voters (12%) towards Akhilesh Yadav.\n\nAkhilesh , in his speeches, kept the BJP and RSS on target and blamed them for designs to change the Constitution . A man dressed as Baba Saheb with a book in hand stood on stage and Akhilesh Yadav received a copy of the Constitution from him with a vow to protect it.\n\nMohd Irfan seemingly failed in getting votes from Muslim community constituting 9 % of voters here and PDA successfully working for Akhilesh Yadav created dent in the belief that Etah was safe for a Lodh candidate.\n\nThe other two seats won by Samajwadi Party, Mainpuri and Firozabad too were PDA success stories . Samajwadi Party, founded by late Mulayam Singh Yadav, has never lost a Lok Sabha election in Mainpuri since 1996 and 2024 was no exception. BJP candidate and minister in UP cabinet Jaiveer Singh failed to stop Dimple Yadav, SP candidate who scored win by 221639 in Mainpuri having Yadav (22%) , Kshatriya (12%), Shakya (10%), Brahmin (8%), Lodh (8%), Muslim (5%) and Vaishya (5%) voters and BSP candidate Shiv Prasad Yadav got only 66814 votes in Mainpuri having 18% Schedule Caste votes.\n\nWon in 2014 and lost in 2019, Firozabad was regained in 2024 by Samajwadi Party. Akshay Yadav, son of Prof Ram Gopal Yadav won by 89312 votes scoring 543037 votes here where BSP candidate Chowdhary Basheer, a former minister , got 90948 votes having 2 lakh Jatav voters reflecting another success story of PDA. SP created inroads among 3.45 lakh Lodh, Nishad and Kashyap voters and added to its traditional Yadav (4 lakh) and Muslim (2 lakh) votes in Firozabad.\n\nSatish Gautam scored hat trick in Aligarh but was trailing behind SP candidate Bijendra Singh for most part of counting day and finally won by only 15647 votes. Aligarh has 7 lakh Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya voters beside 4 lakh Jat, Yadav and Lodh voters. Samajwadi Party candidate gave a run for money in Aligarh having 3.50 lakh Muslims and 3.50 lakh Schedule Caste voters with BSP candidate getting 123929 votes only.", "source": {"uri":

While many were sceptical of Yadav's decisions during the run-up to the General Elections, his victory seems to show otherwise.\n\nEven till late, Akhilesh was seen experimenting, as he kept on replacing various candidates in different constituencies. This exploration of permutations and combinations seems to have eventually played to Akhilesh's benefits. While we mention some of the most important ones where Akhilesh's ticket experiments played out well, there are other examples as well of his smart ticket management which played a major role in the party winning a large number of seats in the election.\n\nBadaun: For a constituency that is a traditional SP stronghold, Dharmendra Yadav, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav's cousin, was seen as the leading choice for candidature as he was in 2009 and 2014. Despite his 2019 blip, his candidature for Badaun was announced in the party's first list on January 28. However, a month later, on February 20th, SP replaced him with Jaswantnagar MLA Shivpal Yadav.\n\nShivpal Yadav, was then replaced by his son Aditya Yadav. The final decision seems to have fared well for Akhilesh as Aditya Yadav won the seat by a margin of 34991 votes against Durvijay Singh Shakya of Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nMoradabad: After initially declaring the name of sitting MP from Moradabad, Dr S T Hasan, he was later replaced by ex-MP Ruchi Veera. The decision to field Veera in a Muslim-majority constituency also proved effective as she won by a margin of 105762 votes against Kunwar Sarvesh Kumar of BJP.\n\nRampur: Even in Rampur, confusion prevailed over the official candidate between Asim Raja and Mohibulla Nadvi.

In 2014, as chief minister (CM) under the shadow of his father and uncles, he saw the Samajwadi Party (SP) face a rout as the Narendra Modi wave swept Uttar Pradesh (UP). In 2017, he confronted a bruising feud within his own family and then saw the BJP win the state assembly elections decisively with Yogi Adityanath taking over as the CM. Yadav had allied with Congress in those elections, a move that helped neither party. In 2019, Yadav joined hands with his arch rival, Mayawati; yet, the BJP managed to comfortably win over 60 seats from the state. And Yadav confronted his fourth consecutive electoral defeat in 2022 as Adityanath returned to power.\n\nBut Yadav, 50, recognised that the BJP's success stemmed from two weaknesses that had come to characterise the SP rule. The first was the reduction of the party from being an umbrella formation of backward groups to being seen as a Yadav party that allowed its caste loyalists to run riot during stints in power to becoming an outfit of a single Yadav family.\n\nThis allowed the BJP to construct a coalition of which a core component were the non-Yadav other backward classes (OBCs) that were resentful that opportunities and power didn't percolate down to them under Yadav dominance. The second was the widespread impression that the SP was partial to Muslims in administration, law enforcement, political appointments and symbolism while in power. This allowed the BJP to construct a wider Hindu coalition that was apprehensive of SP's return to power.\n\nWhat Yadav did therefore was correct both these impressions through substantive steps. For one, he expanded the SP's tent once again and consciously brought in representatives from other backward communities; as this paper reported, the SP gave only half a dozen tickets to Yadav candidates in these elections and instead enhanced representation of both smaller OBC groups and Dalit subgroups, including Jatavs who were looking for options beyond a weak Mayawati and an inconsistent BJP. And, two, while retaining his Muslim support base which consolidated behind the SP-Congress alliance and turned out in large numbers, Yadav ensured that this support of minorities remained a quiet rather than a pronounced feature of his campaign.\n\nAll of this has meant that Yadav has today emerged as probably the INDIA bloc's most important constituent. UP is what made the difference between the BJP having a majority on its own and shrinking below 250 seats. It marked the most important blow to both Modi and Yogi's political reputation. And it has opened space for political competition and social churn ahead of the 2027 state election, in which Yadav will be a more formidable challenger than in the past.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanath", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayawati", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayawati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatav", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jatav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dalit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/04/1600x900/Samajwadi-Party-chief-Akhilesh-Yadav---ANI-_1717515877915.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622405", "eventUri": "eng-9622405", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Since he is the sitting MLA from Karhal in UP's Mainpuri district, the Samajwadi Party chief will have to take a call on which seat he retains.\n\nIrrespective of his choice, Akhilesh is sure to face a tough fight from the BJP which will leave nothing to win the battle of perception in the bypoll on either of the two seats.\n\nHaving won 37 Lok Sabha seats in UP, the Samajwadi Party has emerged as the third largest party in the country after BJP and Congress. Hence there cannot be a more opportune time for Akhilesh Yadav to enter national politics again. The party, too, has dropped hints that he might pick Kannauj over Karhal \"if the situation demands\".\n\nBut there is another side to the story. On several occasions, Akhilesh had categorically denied nursing any aspiration for national politics and has refrained from pitching himself as the prime ministerial candidate in the event of a national coalition staking claim to form govt at the Centre. However, of late, his responses have been more open-ended.\n\n\"People in Karhal know what will happen,\" Akhilesh had told TOI days before the LS results when asked which seat he would retain. It suggested that he was contesting from Kannauj after due consultation with the people of Karhal.\n\nEven in his several media interactions Akhilesh has always said he would prefer to concentrate on Uttar Pradesh instead of national politics. He had reiterated this stand in his recent interview with TOI. \"Lucknow is Lucknow. Who will like to leave the city of Lucknow,\" he had said and hastened to add \"One can always fly to Delhi and fly back to Lucknow.\"\n\nAs per the Representation of Peoples' Act, Akhilesh will have to take a call on Karhal or Kannauj in the next 14 days. Within SP, there is feeling that Akhilesh may not opt to give up Karhal unless and until INDIA bloc decides to stake claim to form the govt at the Centre.\n\nThe BJP will spare no effort to win the bypoll to send across a message that Lok Sabha poll results, where it got 33 seats in UP against SP's 37, were just a one-time setback and not the start of a trend. The SP brass is aware of the BJP challenge and is prepared too.\n\nIf Akhilesh decides to leave Kannauj, the bypoll will leave SP in a tight spot like it was before the 2024 polls began. Initially, SP had named Tej Pratap Yadav from Kannauj but Akhilesh had to replace him and enter the fray following feedback from party functionaries that fielding Tej was a 'risky' preposition.\n\nIn case he quits Karhal, SP in all probability will field Tej Pratap Yadav from the seat as he is the constituency in-charge for Akhilesh. However, the bypoll will push SP to choose the Leader of Opposition to replace Akhilesh in the UP assembly. On the brighter side, the situation will give an opportunity to SP to name its senior most legislator, Shivpal Yadav, as LoP - but at the risk of reviving the 'dynasty politics' tag. Else it will offer a chance to the party strategist to name an MLA from a particular caste or community it wants to warm up to, in order to send across a strong political message.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pervez_siddiqui@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Pervez Siddiqui", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karhal_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karhal Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannauj", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kannauj"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kannauj"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainpuri_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mainpuri district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainpuri district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tej_Pratap_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tej Pratap Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Parties", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110751260,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-14708,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622405", "eventUri": "eng-9622405", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

The team reviewed it. I reviewed it,\" said Norris about the Canadian GP.\n\n\"We listened to radios, and all those kinds of things.\n\n\"There was nothing like, 'Oh, we've clearly messed up. We've done something wrong'. But it [not stopping when the safety car came out] was still a tricky decision.\n\n\"We simply should have been a bit little bit more prepared. I should have simply had the 'if safety car [comes out] box' call, because, at the same time, from my side, I don't know how much rain there is going to be. I'm getting told there's rain, and so I'm judging a lot of my feelings and decisions off what the team are telling me.\n\n\"So, it's a little bit from their side, a little bit from my side, in provoking or giving more feedback - those kind of things.\"\n\nNorris feels that McLaren does not need to do things dramatically different. Instead, he feels that with such tiny margins separating teams now, it is the details that are critical - and it is the small things that the squad has to tidy up.\n\n\"It's not big changes,\" he said. \"It's not like you have to change anything drastically. It's just one more question, or it's just one more little decision that we've got to kind of make.\n\n\"It's very small things, but they just have very big consequences, like we saw. Really, I'm happy with everyone. I'm happy with the team and their work ethic and how they're trying to improve on all these areas.\n\n\"I'm confident we'll just go and do another weekend and we'll make better decisions. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nNorris' belief is echoed by team-mate Oscar Piastri, who suggests that McLaren is now in a position in the field where any tiny error is punished and exposed.\n\n\"There's more pressure, you're under the spotlight more, and your mistakes cost a bit more,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"You're fighting against teams that have, certainly in Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes' case, been at the front for decades basically. For us it's been a bit of a more recent return to the front. So, I guess in some ways we are less experienced than some others around that.\n\n\"I guess we're kind of still in some ways, not learning to be back at the front, but [in a situation where] you can't make any mistakes. You can't give any little pocket of opportunity to anybody because there's people there to take it and it does cost you.\"\n\nAnd while Norris accepts there is some annoyance at wins slipping through its fingers recently, he also says the team has to remember how far it has come over the past 12 months.\n\n\"I think you have to look at the positives, because we're still fresh off consecutive bad seasons,\" he said.\n\n\"WIe definitely have to remind ourselves of how bad it's been and the progress we've made. It's easy to forget that very quickly.\n\n\"That's good motivation for everyone, the knowledge of how bad we were, versus where we are now. That's encouraging for everyone in the team.\n\n\"But at the same time, everything is relative, whether you're fighting for first or 10th, when you have knowledge of you could have made better decisions and you could have potentially won a race. And a win means even more.\n\n\"If it's like when you're fighting for 10th and it might be for ninth, then you're like, 'Okay, it's one or two points'. But when it's second and you think 'I should have won a race' it hurts pretty more.\"", "source": {"uri": "motorsport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motorsport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imola", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imola"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Piastri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Piastri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn-7.motorsport.com/images/amp/YBeOyDW2/s6/lando-norris-mclaren-f1-team.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668629", "eventUri": "eng-9668629", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

He's just strong in all areas so it's rare that he makes mistakes, it's rare that he messes up qualifying.\n\n\"A bit more pressure now, you never know how that changes, and always easier to make mistakes.\n\n\"I think it's tough because you can't doubt Max in any area, he doesn't have a weakness outright.\n\n\"It's possible but he's going to need a very good car performance, a very consistent performance throughout the whole season.\n\n\"As you've seen they've been a little bit more up and down than what we have so we just need to capitalise on when they're down and try and be the one car that's at the front and on the up.\"\n\nNorris has been fighting to win each of the past three grands prix.\n\nHe admitted encouragement and frustration at a pair of P2s and a P4.\n\n\"Both. I think you have to look at the positives because I think we're still, let's say, fresh off consecutive bad seasons,\" he said.\n\n\"So I think we definitely have to remind ourselves of how bad it's been and the progress we've made.\n\n\"I think it's easy to forget that very quickly. I think that's good motivation for everyone is the knowledge of last year, how bad we were versus where we are now.\n\n\"I think that's encouraging for everyone in the team. So reminding everyone of that, I think, is important.\n\n\"But at the same time, then everything is relative. Still, whether you're fighting for first or tenth, when you have knowledge of you could have made better decisions, you could have potentially won a race, and the win means even more.\n\n\"When you're fighting for tenth and it might be for ninth, then you're like, OK, it's one of two points. But when it's second and you're like, I should have won a race, you're freaking winning a freaking race.\n\n\"So it hurts pretty more. But at the same time, encouraged, because having the knowledge of we should have won just kind of makes us more motivated to go into the next race weekend thinking to try and make up for the last one.\"\n\nNorris insists that more than just a very good is required to fight for victory at every F1 grand prix.\n\n\"Yes, 100%. Especially now, probably for Max over the last four years, three years, he's probably been able to get away with a lot of mistakes and still easily win,\" he said.\n\n\"And the team maybe made mistakes and he could still easily win.\n\n\"Let's say he shouldn't have won last weekend in Montreal, but he was probably just the most consistent through the race, probably made as a team the least mistakes, as a driver the least mistakes and came out on top.\n\n\"If you think the safety car from our side, we should have boxed, we lost the lead on that, lost an opportunity to fight for the win.\n\n\"George had the quickest car, was driving extremely well all weekend.\n\n\"From an outright pace point of view, and if he didn't make a couple of the mistakes [that] he did do, which all drivers do, including Max, probably also should have had a chance of winning the race.\n\n\"So that perspective, you kind of think Max shouldn't have won and he still won the race, which just shows that even when he hasn't had the best car and things like that, he still kind of shows what he's capable of doing.\n\n\"But we've always known it, it's not simply we just got a better car and then you just crack on and forget about everything else.\n\n\"Now it's actually even more important to get the strategy right, to get the smaller things correct, because at the end of the day when the cars are so similar on pace, those things start to make a big difference.\"", "source": {"uri": "crash.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dielhenn@crash.net", "name": "James Dielhenn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Sainz_Sr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Sainz Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Norris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Norris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Verstappen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leclerc", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Leclerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferrari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety car"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.crash.net/styles/xl/s3/pa/3599184.0064_0.jpg?itok=b8Dv9w-T", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668629", "eventUri": "eng-9668629", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

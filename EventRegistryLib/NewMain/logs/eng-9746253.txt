The company reported Rs 1,502 Cr revenue with an EBITDA loss of Rs 792 Cr. Notably, it plans growth through cost optimization and market expansions despite disruptions.\n\nOne 97 Communications Limited, the proprietor of Paytm, has disclosed its financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025. The company's operating revenue stood at Rs 1,502 Cr, with an Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA) loss of Rs 792 Cr. The loss before considering Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) was Rs 545 Cr, as previously projected. The results align with the expectations set in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe firm revealed that the full financial impact of recent disruptions was evident in Q1 FY2025. However, it expresses optimism for future revenue and profitability boosts, driven by growth in merchant payment metrics such as Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), enhanced merchant activation, and an expanding merchant base. Furthermore, the company secured revenue from financial services amounting to Rs 280 Cr, and marketing services generated Rs 321 Cr. During this period, the contribution profit reached Rs 755 Cr, reflecting a 50 percent profit margin.\n\nAccording to a Paytm spokesperson, the company is witnessing a rebound in merchant operating metrics and stability in its consumer base, which signifies a promising path to recovery. The spokesperson emphasized the trust from merchant partners and consumers, underlining the company's strong balance sheet with Rs 8,108 Cr in cash reserves and a 5.4 percent stake in PayPay Corporation upon exercising stock acquisition rights.\n\nNew merchant sign-ups have ascended to levels seen in January 2024. Efforts to redeploy inactive devices to new merchants have increased the merchant subscriber base to 1.09 Cr. The company anticipates its net device merchant additions will return to previous levels by Q3 FY2025.\n\nPaytm reported improvements in the daily average GMV, nearing January 2024 metrics. The June quarter recorded a GMV of Rs 4.3 lakh crore, with steady month-on-month growth. The platform's user base stabilized at around 7.8 crore by June's end, evidencing strong user loyalty and retention.\n\nThe company awaits regulatory permissions to onboard new UPI consumers, which is expected to further elevate the Monthly Transacting User (MTU) base. Additionally, Paytm achieved a 9 percent quarter-on-quarter reduction in employee costs, targeting annual savings of Rs 400-500 Cr as part of its cost-management strategy.\n\nFocusing on consumer-centric offerings, Paytm has successfully leveraged merchant insights to tailor insurance products. There is noteworthy traction in embedded and DIY insurance like motor insurance, and the company offers comprehensive health insurance with OPD benefits. Future plans include expanding credit distribution and secured lending products.\n\nLooking forward, Paytm aims to innovate in merchant payments and introduce new devices, aggregating various merchant discount rate (MDR)-bearing payment instruments. Additionally, major resource allocation will target insurance and mutual fund distribution for substantial monetization opportunities.

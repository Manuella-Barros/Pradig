That includes Marcus Rashford, who was left out of England's Euro 2024 squad.\n\nBoth Van Nistelrooy and Hake have extensive experience, and have managed at the highest level in their native Netherlands.\n\nHake has left his role at Go Ahead Eagles having led them to ninth in the Eredivisie last season, to join his old friend Ten Hag.\n\nThe pair previously worked together at FC Twente's academy.\n\nVan Nistelrooy, meanwhile, is well known to English football fans.\n\nHe famously played for Man United from 2001 to 2006, scoring 150 goals in 219 appearances for the club before signing for Real Madrid.\n\nThe Dutchman helped the club to a Premier League title, as well as an FA Cup and League Cup during his time at the club.\n\nHaving retired from playing in 2021, he went on to work at PSV Eindhoven in their academy and eventually became head coach in May 2023.\n\nAfter winning the 2022/23 KNVB Cup, he resigned with one match remaining in the 2022/23 Eredivisie season, citing a lack of support at boardroom level.\n\nHe was recently interviewed for the vacant manager's job at Burnley following Vincent Kompany's move to Bayern Munich.\n\nThe changes to the coaching team at Man United come after it was confirmed Ten Hag will continue as boss next season, despite huge speculation over his future.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, whose INEOS purchased a 25 per cent stake in the club last season, conducted an extensive end of season review.\n\nThis also included speaking to several potential replacements for Ten Hag, including Thomas Tuchel and Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nNow United have put their faith in Ten Hag, and he is shaking things up in an attempt to transform their fortunes after their worst-ever Premier League finish last term (eighth).\n\nMason Greenwood, meanwhile, will exit the club after an impressive loan spell with LaLiga club Getafe and will not return to United training as he negotiates a transfer away.\n\nThe future is less clear for Jadon Sancho, who was also loaned out last season, to Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThere will be plenty of introductions taking place at Carrington this week. Manchester United's players might not have a new manager to welcome, but the voices on the training pitches will be different.\n\nErik ten Hag survived a tense end-of-season review to remain as United manager, with the club activating the extension in his contract last week to ensure he is tied down for two more years. He retained the title of manager and significant power in recruitment.\n\nBut Ten Hag had to make some concessions and one of them was a shake-up of the staff around him. Highly-rated coach Eric Ramsay had already left for a head coach role at Minnesota United before the end of the season, while Benni McCarthy didn't have his contract renewed.\n\nALSO READ: Absent for games and complaining - why Manchester United had to change coaches\n\nALSO READ: United's drastic transfer plan could see three centre-backs signed and one sold\n\nThere was so much uncertainty around the backroom staff at Old Trafford that one coach, whose deal expired on June 30, was just a week earlier telling clubs interested in recruiting him that he didn't know what his future held at United. As the contracts of coaches ticked down to expiry, the priority remained on reaching an agreement with Ten Hag.\n\nGradually, the bricks are falling into place, and the Dutch flavour at Carrington has only been strengthened. The canteen might need to top up on pancakes and cans of Heineken. 0%, of course.\n\nRuud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake are set to join Ten Hag's staff, as is goalkeeping coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar. All three were at Carrington for the start of pre-season training, but are waiting on visas before they can formally begin work. Steve McClaren also remains at the club, although he is on crutches for now after having an operation on his foot.\n\nMitchell van der Gaag is expected to be the most high-profile casualty. The 52-year-old has been Ten Hag's right-hand man since stepping up to the role of assistant at Ajax ahead of the 2021/22 season. He is now expected to pursue ambitions to become a manager in his own right once again, having previously taken charge of clubs in Portugal and Cyprus, as well as the Netherlands.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The former goalkeeper was Vincent Kompany's goalkeeping coach at Anderlecht and followed him to Burnley in 2022. This summer, with Kompany heading to Bayern Munich, Ten Rouwelaar opted to return to the Netherlands and accepted a job as Ajax's goalkeeping coach.\n\nUnited came calling after less than two weeks in the job, offering to more than double the 43-year-old's salary in Amsterdam. They ended up paying Ajax \u20ac100,000 for a coach who would have been available for nothing just a few weeks earlier.\n\nTen Rouwelaar will be tasked with working with the goalkeepers, but in Van Nistelrooy and Hake, Ten Hag now has two strong voices alongside him and coaches who had also been in his shoes until recently.\n\nVan Nistelrooy was managing Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven during the 2022/23 season, before leaving the club under a cloud. The 48-year-old clashed with chief executive Marcel Brands and some players had questioned his coaching. One source in the Netherlands suggested the former United striker had developed a reputation as \"not being an innovative coach\", but in a more low-profile role at Carrington, he could have had an impact on United's forwards.\n\nHe played a key role in the development of Cody Gakpo at PSV, with the Liverpool attacker joint top-scorer at Euro 2024, having also scored three times during the 2022 World Cup. United's coterie of young forwards could benefit from Van Nistelrooy's mentoring. Rasmus Hojlund has room to develop and he could be joined in attack by 23-year-old Dutch striker Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nVan Nistelrooy had been in the running for managerial jobs this summer and was interviewed for the role at Turf Moor after Kompany's departure to Bayern, although it was felt that his heart wasn't in taking a job in the Championship.\n\nHake's experience of doing the top job is even more recent. The 52-year-old has spent the previous two seasons in charge at Go Ahead Eagles, steering them to a first-ever European campaign next season after winning a play-off to qualify for the Europa Conference League. He signed a new contract in October and United will have to pay compensation for him.\n\nThe relationship between Ten Hag and Hake goes back more than 15 years, to their time working together in the academy at FC Twente, and they have remained close ever since and still talk regularly about football and their vision for the game, seeking advice and support from one another. Hake has more than 330 games as a manager on his CV and is highly respected in the Netherlands.\n\nA source who has worked with a number of elite coaches in the country said Hake was renowned as being astute and a \"very good coach\". He also shares some basic principles with Ten Hag, such as a commitment to a 4-2-3-1 shape or a 4-3-3 system.\n\nHake wants his team to press high and play in a dominant way, a style Ten Hag tried to introduce last pre-season before the injury crisis meant he lost his way. Hake could help to reaffirm those principles. He is also keen to make the pitch wide, seeking combinations out towards the flanks during build-up play.\n\nIneos gave serious consideration to replacing Ten Hag this summer, sounding out replacements including Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi.

Agreement on agent commission is speeding up the transfer process. Ruud van Nistelrooy is set to join Man Utd's coaching staff, replacing Mitchell van der Gaag.\n\nManchester United are now working to finalise a deal for Bologna's Joshua Zirkzee, according to The Athletic's David Ornstein, who suggested that Erik ten Hag's side's ability to agree on his agent's commission fee helped progress the deal near to its conclusion.\n\nApart from young Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund, the Red Devils' options through the middle are relatively threadbare. Anthony Martial has departed the club after nine years of service and, while Marcus Rashford can perform in the number 9 role, he's better suited to the left flank.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Hojlund was Manchester United's top goalscorer across 2023/24, notching 16 strikes in 43 outings.\n\nAs such, Ten Hag and his new-look entourage have made their intentions clear that a new striker is among the priority positions to address this summer - and Zirkzee, a former Bayern Munich youth prospect, is their primary candidate.\n\nMan Utd Deal for Zirkzee Reaching Final Stages ' Close\n\nIt seems now that Zirkzee's arrival in Greater Manchester is going to be the first of many of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era, with Fabrizio Romano recently reporting that a five-year deal had been agreed between all parties.\n\nSpeaking on The Athletic FC Podcast, Ornstein revealed that Manchester United, who finished eighth last term, are now working to finalise the signing of the 23-year-old technician and their pursuit has been sped up thanks to their ability to strike a deal with his agent over a commission fee being a big driving force behind the move.\n\n\"The very latest is what we revealed on Sunday afternoon, and it's that Manchester United are working to finalise the signing of Joshua Zirkzee. One of the crucial elements is that they were able to agree personal terms and the agent commission, which was a big talking point.\n\n\"It's going to be sizable, but that's perhaps understandable, given the fact that the players' camp have managed to negotiate a release clause in his contract that makes him available for a fee that is probably lower than his market value.\n\nOrnstein insisted that such a considerable figure is typical for agents that have managed to keep the fee for the player in question lower than market value - similar to the case of Erling Haaland's switch to Manchester City.\n\n\"So it's not uncommon that you would see substantial agent commission as almost a reward for doing that. And I think we saw something similar in the case of Erling Harland. And when you look at the package as a whole, Manchester United will feel that is decent value for money.\"\n\nA graceful dribbler with an eye for goal, Zirkzee offers a completely different profile to that of Hojlund and, as a result, there is an ever-growing belief that the plan that Manchester United have for the two young hotshots will work out.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee Stats vs Positional Peers\n\nMetric\n\nOutput per 90\n\nPercentile\n\nNon-Penalty Goals\n\n0.29\n\n35%\n\nShot-Creating Actions\n\n3.16\n\n79%\n\nPasses Attempted\n\n29.91\n\n84%\n\nProgressive Passes\n\n2.81\n\n83%\n\nSuccessful Take-Ons\n\n1.70\n\n89%\n\nTouches\n\n44.82\n\n90%\n\nMitchell van der Gaag Set to Leave Man Utd Ruud van Nistelrooy confirmed as replacement\n\nAhead of an all-important season, there have been a myriad of changes to the Old Trafford staff personnel.

The Red Devils are also actively looking to put a strong medical department in place at Old Trafford.\n\nEarlier this summer, The Peoples Person covered a report claiming Arsenal physio Jordan Reece is set to join United, reuniting with former Arsenal head of medical services Gary O'Driscoll, who moved to Manchester in 2023.\n\nNow, according to the Daily Mail's Chris Wheeler, first-team physios Richard Merron and John Davin are exiting United.\n\nBoth physios have been long-term servants for the Premier League giants. Davin has been at United since 1997 and Merron departs after spending 23 years at the club.\n\nSuch tough decisions are much needed on the back of the season which saw Ten Hag's side suffer more than 60 individual cases of injury or illness.\n\nHowever, the report adds that 'no personal blame' is being attached to the two long-standing physios and the decision is just a part of a 'wider restructuring' of the medical department.\n\nMeanwhile, the first team has also seen a big exit in the early days of July. United have agreed a deal with Girona over Donny van de Beek's permanent transfer.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Dutch midfielder, who moved to United from Ajax in 2020, took to Instagram to bid farewell to supporters.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishal_singh@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Vishal Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leny_Yoro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leny Yoro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruud_van_Nistelrooy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruud van Nistelrooy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_van_der_Gaag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitchell van der Gaag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren\u00e9_Hake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ren\u00e9 Hake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington,_Greater_Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrington, Greater Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carrington, Greater Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_van_de_Beek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donny van de Beek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Girona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks,_Vans,_and_Sport_Utility", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Trucks, Vans, and Sport Utility", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/erik-ten-hag-van-der-gaag-brentford-fc-v-manchester-united-premier-league-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718443", "eventUri": "eng-9718443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Lille's Leny Yoro, who is also admired by Real Madrid, is also of interest to the three-time Champions League winners.\n\nRomano: De Ligt's Focus Is on Old Trafford Switch Agent only negotiating with Man Utd Close\n\nSpeaking exclusively to GIVEMESPORT, Romano suggested that the positive, pre-existing relationship between De Ligt and Ten Hag could help speed up the transfer process. The football insider insisted that, despite the ever-growing noise around his name, the Ajax graduate's sole priority is getting a deal over the line. He said:\n\n\"The manager knows him very well since their time together at Ajax. So the idea of Matthijs de Ligt is to go to Manchester United, and he's giving total priority to Man United in terms of personal terms negotiations. Despite all the links we also had with other clubs, the focus of Matthijs de Ligt is on Man United. His agent, Rafaela Pimenta, is only negotiating with Manchester United.\"\n\nMitchell van der Gaag Has Man Utd Contract Terminated Ruud van Nistelrooy lined up as replacement Close\n\nWhile much of the focus will be around on-the-pitch changes for Manchester United fans, the complexion of Ten Hag's coaching staff has altered recently after Mitchell van der Gaag saw his Old Trafford contract terminated.\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), Romano suggested that Ruud van Nistelrooy, widely regarded as one of the best strikers in Manchester United history, will be the direct replacement for Ten Hag's right-hand man.\n\nRelated Ruud van Nistelrooy 'In Manchester' Ahead of Man Utd Move\n\nManchester United are pushing to bring Ruud van Nistelrooy to the club in a coaching role.\n\nSince Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority takeover of the Premier League behemoths, Dan Ashworth, Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have been lured from rival clubs, while van Nistelrooy is set to be joined by ex-Go

A season later, the coach did manage to do so: last season, Go Ahead Eagles finished ninth in the Eredivisie. In the play-offs, it was then too strong for NEC and FC Utrecht, which meant that Hake and his men qualified for European football. Under Hake, Go Ahead Eagles also finished in the left row of the Eredivisie for the first time since 1979. Go Ahead Eagles would like to thank Rene Hake for the past two seasons and wishes him every success in Manchester.\"\n\nAs a result of the new arrivals, Benni McCarthy has left the club but Steve McClaren will remain. The future also looks bleak for Mitchell van de Gaag unless he has another job up his sleeve.\n\nHopefully, Van Nistelrooy and Hake can help bring positive changes to the team over the coming years.\n\nSubscribe to the Stretty News podcast Strettycast for weekly episodes on Manchester United.

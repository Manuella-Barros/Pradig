But this year, when images of Muslims kneeling down to pray on the grass were widely shared on social media -- including by prominent Quebec pundits -- the borough started to receive complaints.\n\n\"It's rare that we receive 10 or 15 emails exactly on the same subject, exactly at the same moment, so .... we know that something is going on the social media or on the media,\" said Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough mayor \u00c9milie Thuillier. The complaints, she said, were enough for her to consider banning all religious events in Parc des Hirondelles.\n\n\"We have noted that some boroughs in Montreal prohibit religious ceremonies in parks and we will explore this issue .... but we haven't taken a decision,\" she said.\n\nThe episode is part of a long-standing debate in Quebec on the presence of religious expression in public life -- particularly Islamic expression. Quebec's promotion of state secularism led to the adoption of Bill 21, which bans some public servants, including teachers and police officers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. Muslim groups have criticized the law for having a disproportionate affect on their community, as many Muslim women wear a head scarf.\n\nDavid Rand, a spokesperson for Rassemblement pour la la\u00efcit\u00e9, a pro-secularism group, says religious celebrations belong in houses of worship and not public spaces. His organization wrote a letter published in Montreal's Le Devoir newspaper that said the city has allowed a public park to transform into \"sacred space for worship.\"\n\nIn an interview, Rand said, \"As a religious event, it excludes people of other religions, and this is supposed to be a public park open to the general public. What they've done is they turned the part of the park into a temporary mosque.\"\n\nSamer Majzoub, president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, says there was nothing controversial about the celebration, adding that while he wasn't present at Parc des Hirondelles for the festivities, he says the prayer would not have lasted more than a few minutes.\n\nMajzoub says the mayor was \"fair\" in allowing the community -- composed of local residents and taxpayers -- to celebrate in the park, adding that some people are blowing the event out of proportion and singling out Quebec's Muslims.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dejean, a religion professor at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, says the reaction to the event on social media and from political commentators has been surprising, but it comes amid rising anti-Muslim feeling in Western countries.\n\nEvery year, Dejean says, thousands of Christians gather for the March for Jesus on the streets of downtown Montreal to sing and spread the Gospel, while Hare Krishna members regularly chant in subway stations.\n\nBut those displays of religious expression seem to go unnoticed, he said. \"It's only when it's about Muslims that some people say it sounds like a problem.\"\n\nDejean says it is important in a democratic society to allow people to express their religion, even on public space, within limits. Religious events, like secular ones, must respect laws on things such as noise limits and hate speech, he said. What's important, he added, is for the city or boroughs to make sure the events they permit on their territory don't violate the law.\n\nRand says all faiths, including Christianity and Judaism, have fundamentalists in their congregations, but he says Islam has a \"definite political goal of occupying as much space as possible.\" He rejects accusations of Islamophobia, saying the word itself is a \"nonsense term\" and a \"code for blasphemy\" used to censor criticism of the religion.\n\nMajzoub disagrees, saying that Muslims are held to a different standard compared to other faiths in Quebec.\n\n\"They went to the city, and they got the approval. This is not imposing,\" he said of the Eid celebration. Quebecers only bring up the importance of secularism, he said, \"when it comes to Islam.\"\n\nQuebec's Secularism Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis

The complaints, she said, were enough for her to consider banning all religious events in Parc des Hirondelles.\n\n\"We have noted that some boroughs in Montreal prohibit religious ceremonies in parks and we will explore this issue .... but we haven't taken a decision,\" she said.\n\nThe episode is part of a long-standing debate in Quebec on the presence of religious expression in public life -- particularly Islamic expression. Quebec's promotion of state secularism led to the adoption of Bill 21, which bans some public servants, including teachers and police officers, from wearing religious symbols on the job. Muslim groups have criticized the law for having a disproportionate affect on their community, as many Muslim women wear a head scarf.\n\nDavid Rand, a spokesperson for Rassemblement pour la la\u00efcit\u00e9, a pro-secularism group, says religious celebrations belong in houses of worship and not public spaces. His organization wrote a letter published in Montreal's Le Devoir newspaper that said the city has allowed a public park to transform into \"sacred space for worship.\"\n\nIn an interview, Rand said, \"As a religious event, it excludes people of other religions, and this is supposed to be a public park open to the general public. What they've done is they turned the part of the park into a temporary mosque.\"\n\nSamer Majzoub, president of the Canadian Muslim Forum, says there was nothing controversial about the celebration, adding that while he wasn't present at Parc des Hirondelles for the festivities, he says the prayer would not have lasted more than a few minutes.\n\nMajzoub says the mayor was \"fair\" in allowing the community -- composed of local residents and taxpayers -- to celebrate in the park, adding that some people are blowing the event out of proportion and singling out Quebec's Muslims.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dejean, a religion professor at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, says the reaction to the event on social media and from political commentators has been surprising, but it comes amid rising anti-Muslim feeling in Western countries.\n\nEvery year, Dejean says, thousands of Christians gather for the March for Jesus on the streets of downtown Montreal to sing and spread the Gospel, while Hare Krishna members regularly chant in subway stations.\n\nBut those displays of religious expression seem to go unnoticed, he said. \"It's only when it's about Muslims that some people say it sounds like a problem.\"\n\nDejean says it is important in a democratic society to allow people to express their religion, even on public space, within limits. Religious events, like secular ones, must respect laws on things such as noise limits and hate speech, he said. What's important, he added, is for the city or boroughs to make sure the events they permit on their territory don't violate the law.\n\nRand says all faiths, including Christianity and Judaism, have fundamentalists in their congregations, but he says Islam has a \"definite political goal of occupying as much space as possible.\" He rejects accusations of Islamophobia, saying the word itself is a \"nonsense term\" and a \"code for blasphemy\" used to censor criticism of the religion.\n\nMajzoub disagrees, saying that Muslims are held to a different standard compared to other faiths in Quebec.\n\n\"They went to the city, and they got the approval. This is not imposing,\" he said of the Eid celebration. Quebecers only bring up the importance of secularism, he said, \"when it comes to Islam.\"\n\nQuebec's Secularism Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Roberge did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis

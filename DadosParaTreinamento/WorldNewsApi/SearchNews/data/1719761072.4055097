The company, co-founded in 2021 by CEO Pujun Bhatnagar, has lined up Link Ventures to lead its financing, with participation from Venture Highway, KyberKnight, Plug and Play and DeVC, as well as a number of angel investors. Kintsugi\u2019s software enables businesses to automate their compliance with sales tax regulation, which has become more complex in the US in recent years. Failures to report the right sales tax data, or to pay what is due, can expose businesses to significant penalties and costs, as well as reputational damage, but getting it right is challenging when companies rely on manual processes. \u201cAchieving compliance is not an activity that is going to generate any revenue but many businesses are spending hundreds of hours each year doing this work,\u201d says Bhatnagar. \u201cOur technology can help them hugely reduce that.\u201d The problems facing US businesses dealing with sales tax were amplified by a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2018. Since then, even online sellers have been required to collect and remit sales tax to jurisdictions in which it is due. The current system means that businesses must identify which state \u2013 or country if the sale is international \u2013 each of their customers is from, so that they can levy the right amount of sales tax when selling to them. They must be registered to pay sales tax in every jurisdiction in which they have customers, and they must then ensure the tax paid by customers is remitted to the right jurisdiction in line with its deadlines. Other complications include the fact that some customers are exempt from paying sales tax \u2013 certain charities, for example \u2013 so relevant information here needs to be checked and verified.

The technology automatically collects the information that companies need to work out what sales tax to charge. It then calculates how much is due on each transaction so that it can be added to the customer\u2019s bill. In addition, Kintsugi\u2019s software also allows businesses to connect to the jurisdictions in which they must pay tax, so they can register for an account and pay what they owe. \u201cIt\u2019s all about saving businesses time and money while ensuring they remain compliant,\u201d explains Bhatnagar. The software relies on an engine driven by machine learning; every 15 minutes, this engine scans the web pages produced by states across the US and countries worldwide in order to check for any changes made to their sales tax regimes. This ensures the calculations it makes on behalf of businesses are always compliant with the current rules in the jurisdictions they are selling to. This approach reflects Bhatnagar\u2019s background as a machine learning engineer at Facebook. He co-founded Kintsui with former Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs analyst Barkin Doganay, and former Atlassian executive and MonetizeNow CTO Jeff Gibson. The trio saw the fall-out from the 2018 Supreme Court ruling as an opportunity for a new venture, particularly since the accounting software suppliers that many small and medium-sized businesses use are reluctant to provide support with the intricacies of sales tax. So far, Kintsugi has signed up around 300 customers for its software, helping them to process around 800 million transactions. The company now wants to use the funding it has raised to expand beyond the US, with plans for launches into Canada, the UK and the rest of Europe. The company\u2019s investors think it can prosper, given the imperative for businesses to access help with sales tax compliance. \u201cSales tax is defined and collected on a city, county and state level, and performing this task manually takes hours, as does keeping track of ever-changing laws,\u201d says Lisa Dolan, managing partner at Link Ventures. \u201cKintsugi uses AI to make compliance fast and painless, and then automates the process so companies can focus on their businesses instead of tax paperwork.\u201d Follow me on Twitter.

As the night progressed, other students entered the encampment and barricaded themselves with signs before additional officers and State Police troopers arrived and took them into custody.\n\nIn videos posted on the UMass chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine Instagram account, police were seen tackling students who surrounded the encampment while shouting obscenities at the officers. In one video, officers tackled a protester running toward someone who students on the scene said appeared to be being tased on the ground, pushing down on the neck and head of the student who interfered. UMass said Wednesday that its police reported that no tasers were used Tuesday night and that what observers saw was a strobe flashlight being used.\n\nPolice zip-tied the hands of arrested protestors behind their backs and took them via bus to the campus police station or the Mullins Center for holding. They were released early Wednesday morning on $40 bail, which UMass SJP paid for using a bail fund they encouraged their social media followers to support.\n\nIn October, campus police arrested 57 UMass students and faculty members for trespassing during a sit-in at the Whitmore Administration Building. As part of the students' demands Thursday, they asked the Student Code of Conduct Office to drop any sanctions or charges against those 57 protestors. Reyes said in his email that he's \"actively reviewing\" the cases and that there are no criminal cases pending against students arrested in October, and all infractions have been reduced to civil penalties.\n\nReyes also noted that in June, the UMass Board of Trustees plans to consider a proposal developed by UMass Amherst Student Trustee Chris Brady to divest from defense firms. He noted the UMass Amherst Foundation Board, which manages the university's endowment, received a similar request to consider divesting from the defense industry.\n\nStudent protestors attempted to set up a similar encampment April 29, but dismantled it the next morning based on concerns they would face arrest or academic sanctions. Organizers said they were motivated to reestablish the encampment Tuesday as Israel began invading Rafah, a city where more than a million Palestinian refugees have retreated throughout the war, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"Our encampment has been re-established in light of our demands not being met and in light of the horrifying invasion of Rafah,\" protestors wrote in an open letter posted to the SJP Instagram account. \"Join us at the encampment to sustain the pressure. ... The fight is only getting started.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Massachusetts Institute of Technology students received word from MIT President Sally Kornbluth that their encampment was deemed \"no longer safely sustainable,\" and they could face suspension for refusing to dismantle their tents. Harvard students received a similar message, weeks into an ongoing movement at college campuses across the country in support of a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nSome 1,200 Israelis were killed in Hamas's invasion on Oct. 7, and about 250 people were taken hostage into Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have since been killed in the ongoing conflict.\n\nMore than 2,000 American students have been arrested as part of these protests, the Associated Press reports, and multiple schools have reconfigured their spring commencement ceremonies to mitigate the risk of potential disruptions.\n\nCarol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, responded to the arrests in Amherst by saying in a statement that \"other campuses across the country have engaged demonstrators in productive dialogue.\"\n\n\"Last night in Amherst, and events on campuses across the country, make clear: When universities choose to involve police in nonviolent demonstrations, it escalates tensions and creates unacceptable safety risks for all students, faculty, and community members,\" Rose said. \"Campus administrators have an obligation to protect students' safety on campus; at the same time, they must take all necessary measures to protect students' right to protest. Calling heavily armed police on student political expression is an inherently dangerous choice.\"\n\nIn his email, Reyes wrote: \"While we may not agree to all the demands presented to us today, including those which would violate the university's founding values of the free and open exchange of ideas, today's meeting could have been a significant step forward in establishing a meaningful dialogue. I asked the students to help UMass Amherst set a model for how civil discourse can progress by dismantling their encampment and engaging with us in constructive discussions - not further confrontations and outright violations of university policy and the law.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated to include new information from UMass, which said its police reported that no tasers were used Tuesday. The university said a strobe flashlight, which law enforcement uses in similar situations, was the source of light seen in a video and by on-scene observers.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com",

As the night progressed, other students entered the encampment and barricaded themselves with signs before additional officers and State Police troopers arrived and took them into custody.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by UMass Amherst Young Communist League \ud83d\udea9 (@yclumass)\n\nIn videos posted on the UMass chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine Instagram account, police were seen tackling students who surrounded the encampment while shouting obscenities at the officers. In one video, officers tackled a protester running towards someone who students on the scene said appeared to be being tased on the ground, pushing down on the neck and head of the student who interfered. UMass said Wednesday that its police reported that no tasers were used Tuesday night and that what observers saw was a strobe flashlight being used.\n\nPolice zip-tied the hands of arrested protestors behind their backs and took them via bus to the campus police station or the Mullins Center for holding. They were released early Wednesday morning on $40 bail, which UMass SJP paid for using a bail fund they encouraged their social media followers to support.\n\nIn October, campus police arrested 57 UMass students and faculty members for trespassing during a sit-in at the Whitmore Administration Building. As part of the students' demands Thursday, they asked the Student Code of Conduct Office to drop any sanctions or charges against those 57 protesters. Reyes said in his email that he's \"actively reviewing\" the cases and that there are no criminal cases pending against students arrested in October, and all infractions have been reduced to civil penalties.\n\nReyes also noted that in June, the UMass Board of Trustees plans to consider a proposal developed by UMass Amherst Student Trustee Chris Brady to divest from defense firms. He noted the UMass Amherst Foundation Board, which manages the university's endowment, received a similar request to consider divesting from the defense industry.\n\nStudent protestors attempted to set up a similar encampment on April 29 but dismantled it the next morning based on concerns they would face arrest or academic sanctions. Organizers said they were motivated to reestablish the encampment Tuesday as Israel began invading Rafah, a city where more than one million Palestinian refugees have retreated throughout the war, according to the United Nations.\n\n\"Our encampment has been re-established in light of our demands not being met and in light of the horrifying invasion of Rafah,\" protestors wrote in an open letter posted to the SJP Instagram account. \"Join us at the encampment to sustain the pressure ... the fight is only getting started.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Massachusetts Institute of Technology students received word from MIT President Sally Kornbluth that their encampment was deemed \"no longer safely sustainable,\" and they could face suspension for refusing to dismantle their tents. Harvard students received a similar message, weeks into an ongoing movement at college campuses across the country in support of a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nSome 1,200 Israelis were killed in Hamas's invasion on Oct. 7, and about 250 people were taken hostage into Gaza. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have since been killed in the ongoing conflict.\n\nMore than 2,000 American students have been arrested as part of these protests, the Associated Press reports, and multiple schools have reconfigured their spring commencement ceremonies to mitigate the risk of potential disruptions.\n\nWilliams College, MCLA students protest colleges' ties to companies supplying weapons used in Israel's war in Gaza\n\nThe nation's wave of student protests over the Israel-Hamas war arrived at Williams College and the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts on Wednesday morning.\n\nCarol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, responded to the arrests in Amherst by saying in a statement that \"other campuses across the country have engaged demonstrators in productive dialogue.\"\n\n\"Last night in Amherst, and events on campuses across the country, make clear: When universities choose to involve police in nonviolent demonstrations, it escalates tensions and creates unacceptable safety risks for all students, faculty, and community members,\" Rose said. \"Campus administrators have an obligation to protect students' safety on campus; at the same time, they must take all necessary measures to protect students' right to protest. Calling heavily armed police on student political expression is an inherently dangerous choice.\"\n\nIn his email, Reyes wrote: \"While we may not agree to all the demands presented to us today, including those which would violate the university's founding values of the free and open exchange of ideas, today's meeting could have been a significant step forward in in establishing a meaningful dialogue. I asked the students to help UMass Amherst set a model for how civil discourse can progress by dismantling their encampment and engaging with us in constructive discussions -- not further confrontations and outright violations of university policy and the law.\"\n\nNorthern Berkshires The Pro-Palestine encampment at Williams College is expanding.

The earlier encampment ended peacefully, according to the administration, but under threats of arrest, according to students.\n\nReached by text shortly before 10 p.m. Tuesday, a UMass spokesperson said he had no \"specific info on arrests at this stage\" but promised an update later in the night or Wednesday morning.\n\nEarlier Tuesday evening, UMass Chancellor Javier Reyes sent a campus-wide email saying he'd met with students, promised consideration of their demands from various university panels, and warned of arrests if the encampment remained.\n\n\"I asked the students to help UMass Amherst set a model for how civil discourse can progress by dismantling their encampment and engaging with us in constructive discussions - not further confrontations and outright violations of university policy and the law,\" Reyes wrote.\n\nReyes wrote protesters declined to remove the \"tents and barriers,\" despite outreach from university staff.\n\n\"Moments ago, I asked the University of Massachusetts Police Department to begin dispersing the crowd and dismantling the encampment,\" he wrote in the message, which was sent around 8 p.m. \"Let me be clear - involving law enforcement is the absolute last resort.\"\n\nNEPM has asked the university spokesperson if there was a specific security threat on Tuesday night requiring use of the \"last resort.\" There was no immediate response.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, student protester Sam Martinez said organizers want UMass to begin disclosing and divesting from any investments or partnerships with arms makers.\n\n\"A big thing is divesting from war profiteers and divesting from a genocide in general. A big focus has been around Raytheon because it's such a big weapons contributor to Israel,\" Martinez said.\n\nAssociate professor Hoang Phan, a member of the group Faculty for Justice in Palestine, said the group's demands are part of the broader Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement seeking, among other things, to end Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"This is a peaceful nonviolence movement that is growing across the globe and you are now joining that BDS movement,\" he said.\n\nThis story is a production of the New England News Collaborative.

DuBois Library.\n\nThis was the second encampment that students were asked to take down within a week. The school states that students violated its land-use policy, \"which requires prior approval for the utilization of university property.\"\n\nAfter police were called in, they arrested over 130 demonstrators, according to a statement from Ed Blaguszewski, the university's spokesperson.\n\nReyes sent an email to students Tuesday night regarding his decision to call in the police, which he did to disperse the crowd and dismantle the encampment.\n\n\"While we have told demonstrators that failure to remove the tents and barriers may result in arrests, this is not the outcome we had hoped for,\" he said.\n\n\"Let me be clear -- involving law enforcement is the absolute last resort,\" he continued.\n\nSpeakers at a rally Wednesday requested that the school be transparent about its investments on a quarterly basis; demand that it keep police off campus grounds; and demanded that the school stop allowing study-abroad programs in Israel.\n\nStudents then said that the chancellor should be removed from his position.\n\n\"Nobody that supports violence deserves any position of power,\" said Malia Cole, a member of UMass' Students for Justice in Palestine, at the rally Wednesday in front of the Student Union. \"He is an absolute disgrace and needs to resign.\"\n\nThe university did not comment on the rally on Wednesday or on the students' demand for Reyes to resign by press time.\n\nReyes was officially inaugurated as the university's 31st chancellor on April 26.\n\nAt around 4 p.m. on Tuesday, members of the Students for Justice in Palestine sat down with Reyes for a meeting, hoping to negotiate their demands and be heard by the administration.\n\nIt was during that meeting, members said, that the police were called on protesters at their \"peaceful encampment on the South Lawn,\" Cole said.\n\n\"This is horrific violence that (Reyes) has forced onto his own students,\" she said.\n\nAbout an hour later, police vehicles started rolling into campus, rally speakers said.\n\nPosts from the student organization's Instagram page detail the timeline.\n\nAt around 7:25 p.m., the organization posted a photo saying the university's administration had told protest organizers in a meeting that they would \"not cut ties with genocide profiteers.\"\n\nOrganizers added that the encampment would remain up until the school divests from Raytheon, a weapons manufacturer.\n\nNot more than 20 minutes later, the account started posting photos of hundreds of police entering the UMass campus, heading toward the encampment.\n\nThen, a video.\n\nThe caption reads, \"UMass Amherst is arresting their faculty. Shame.\"\n\nIn the video, police can be seen arresting people wearing neon-orange vests. At least six people have their hands cuffed behind their backs. In a separate post, those people are identified as UMass faculty members.\n\nBlaguszewski did not return a request for comment on how many faculty were arrested.\n\nThe university's Faculty for Justice in Palestine then posted to its Instagram about police actions.\n\n\"At least two people have been tased, the police are tackling people, throwing them to the ground, and kneeling on their backs,\" the post reads.\n\nThe student organization posted more videos from the encampment of police being rough with protesters.\n\nIn one video, four police officers can be seen tackling one protester, as others yell in the background. Another protester can be seen running toward the officers before also being tackled.\n\nThe next video shows arrests. In one arrest, a state police trooper pins a protester to the ground with his hands around the protester's neck, while another officer in a riot helmet affixes zip ties to his wrists.\n\nProtesters in the background can be heard saying, \"Get off of his back!\" and \"He's on the ground!\" to the police officer kneeling on the protester's back.\n\nA separate video shows a large formation of police officers rushing a group of protesters.\n\nCole said she wasn't one of the protesters arrested on Tuesday, but was one of the 57 people arrested at the university during a protest in October.\n\n\"The cop presence in October wasn't the same as this time,\" she said. \"Last night, (it) felt like they employed an army.\"\n\nCole explained that riot police were threatening her and her friends with arrest on Tuesday. Others were pepper-sprayed or zip tied, she said.\n\nSome of those who were arrested were held through the night, she said.\n\nRuya Hazeyen, a Palestinian senior at UMass and a co-president of Students for Justice in Palestine, said the last seven months have been awful.\n\n\"But in some ways, this is the most support Palestine has gotten,\" she said. \"This is the most the tables have turned.\"\n\nHazeyen said she was also one of the 57 people arrested in October, and that she has friends who were arrested Tuesday night.\n\nDespite that, \"the main feeling I had the whole night was that I was moved,\" she said. \"I was very inspired by the turnout.\"\n\nTatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass, told The Republican he saw the videos of faculty and students being arrested.\n\n\"It was reminiscent of other protests in history, like the 1960s American university protests against South African apartheid,\" he said.\n\nOne of Nteta's academic focuses is on race politics.\n\n\"There is some connective tissue between this movement and that movement,\" he said.\n\nHe said that he hopes the arrests of faculty will not have adverse effects on their careers; he hopes the same for the arrested students and their futures.\n\n\"This is a reflection of a democratic movement,\" he said.\n\nNteta said that he doesn't believe that Tuesday night's arrests will lead to a milder response from students.\n\nThat was confirmed at the rally on Wednesday. Hundreds of students, community members and faculty showed up in support of the movement.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the five largest unions at UMass, representing thousands of staff, faculty and graduate workers, said in a statement that they condemned the \"ongoing criminalization of free speech, the over-policing of campus, the infliction of violence upon our students, and the administration's decision to endanger the health and safety of the entire campus rather than negotiate solutions.\"\n\nThe statement continues that UMass could have sided with other universities across the country, which have found peaceful resolutions, and that Reyes' actions couldn't be justified.\n\n\"There is no valid justification for using force against students simply because they pitched a few tents on the campus lawn, a crime that carries the same weight as jaywalking,\" the statement said.\n\nAccording to others who were at the encampment on Tuesday night, the police were on campus from the evening until 1 a.m. Others who were arrested and spoke at the rally said they were held in jail until the early hours of the morning in brutal conditions.\n\n\"Three of (my fellow) leaders of my organization were arrested last night,\" said Sarah Prager, a leader of Valley Families for Palestine.\n\nPrager said that members of her organization, which is a Western Massachusetts collective of parents who are against Israel's actions in the Gaza strip since Oct. 7, were present with their children during the daytime encampment.\n\n\"It was joyous,\" she said. \"There was shared food and community.\"\n\nWhen she returned later in the night without her kids, she said the police escalated the situation with violence.\n\nDuring their jail time, \"one of our leaders was denied the bathroom for 10 hours, another received an elbow injury during her arrest, and our third leader was denied access to change her tampon,\" Prager said.\n\nAnother speaker said they were held in a solitary cell for the majority of the night.\n\nCole, who is a part of the student organization's jail support team, said she spent many hours of the night speaking to the more than 100 protesters who were arrested, checking on their well-being.\n\n\"We are not equipped to handle watching a genocide, nor are we equipped to see cops brutalize students,\" Hazeyen said. \"There is no way to cope with that.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Lawn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Students for Justice in Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois_Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "W.

Police clashed with protesters gathered in solidarity with Palestinians, leading to 132 arrests, the university confirmed Wednesday night. Of those, UMass estimated 70 were students at the university and six were faculty.\n\n\"The UMass Student Government Association on behalf of the undergraduate students, affirm that they have no confidence in the leadership of Chancellor Reyes,\" the SGA wrote on Instagram.\n\nPrior to the vote, Reyes released a statement saying he had spoken with many on campus Wednesday, discussing \"the events of last night and the previous encampment, along with processes and policies related to student discipline.\"\n\nReyes asked student government leaders and the Faculty Senate to call meetings where he and other school leaders \"can engage in dialogue and answer questions about this challenging episode.\"\n\n\"I know how challenging these events have been for everyone. Safety, wellbeing, and a sense of belonging are paramount for our community's ability to thrive, and I recognize that there is work to do as we restore trust with those who feel harmed by the university's actions,\" Reyes said in the statement.\n\nIn response to the \"no confidence\" vote, a university spokesperson released words of support for Reyes from UMass Board of Trustees Chair Stephen Karam and Marty Meehan, the president of the UMass system.\n\n\"The circumstances on the Amherst campus are in no way isolated and are part of a national trend taking place on college and university campuses across the country,\" Meehan said. \"Chancellor Reyes and his team have engaged in good faith discussions, offered meaningful paths to a resolution, and done everything within their power to engage sincerely and protect students' rights to free speech.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, hundreds of students gathered again, outside the student union, to reaffirm their opposition to the war in Gaza, the university's ties to military contractors, and the arrests the night before. Students for Justice in Palestine, an organizer of both protests, circulated a petition online calling for Reyes' resignation.\n\nAt the same time, the five largest labor unions representing campus staff and faculty criticized the decision to bring in police, as did the ACLU of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern.\n\nMcGovern on Thursday morning told NEPM's The Fabulous 413 that he has received a lot of calls from concerned constituents. He said he has spoken with administrators at UMass about the situation, but not Reyes directly.\n\n\"I expressed my concern about what happened. I regret that police were brought onto the campus and all the arrests that happened. I'm a strong believer in the right to peaceful protest. It's a hallmark of our history,\" McGovern said. \"And I'm a believer that at this very tenuous and challenging moment, we have to be about listening to one another. We have to be about letting people in rather than shutting people out. But it also means that you don't arrest peaceful protesters.\"\n\nMcGovern, a Worcester Democrat whose district include Amherst, acknowledged he did not know all the details that led to the arrests.\n\n\"The university has their own rationale for doing what they did, including concerns about public safety and on and on and on and on. But ... to the best of my knowledge, these protesters were not engaged in any violent activities. They were not disrupting or interrupting peoples' ability to get to class or take their final exams,\" he said. \"I find the whole thing very concerning.\"\n\nMcGovern said he also protested while he was a college student -- even at his own graduation, when his alma mater, American University, chose a controversial economist in the Reagan Administration.\n\nBut the congressman, who spoke at Reyes' inauguration as UMass chancellor in late April, had encouraging words for the campus leader.\n\n\"I'm excited about Chancellor Reyes as chancellor. I think he will do a good job. I just regret that this was kind of the first thing out of the box.\"\n\nNEPM's Nirvani Williams and Monte Belmonte contributed to this report.\n\nDisclosure: The license for NEPM's main radio signal is held by UMass Amherst.

Videos of the arrests flooded social media, showing several physical interactions between state troopers, Amherst Police, UMass Police Depatment and protestors.\n\nIn an email released by Reyes Wednesday evening, he indicated that UMPD and Massachusetts State Police detained 132 people, \"approximately 70 are UMass Amherst students and 6 are UMass Amherst faculty.\"\n\nSJP President Ruya Hazeyen, a senior political science and Middle Eastern studies major, was at the encampment. She said the protest was \"incredible until it wasn't.\"\n\n\"This is a college campus where we are supposed to be able to practice free speech and our right to protest without having to worry about students getting pepper sprayed and shoved to the floor,\" said Hazeyen.\n\nOne of the speakers at the rally was Sarah Prager, a western Massachusetts resident and a co-founder of Valley Families for Palestine (VFP). She was also present at the encampment and watched three other leaders and parents of VFP's get arrested.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the escalation of police presence and violence in my community,\" Prager said. \"All the towns around here are college towns, the colleges are a part of our communities. We live together with students, and we came to show support for the students because we believe in that cause, so to see them brutalized by police was enraging.\"\n\n\"We created a space where students, faculty, staff, families and community members came together to protest the genocide of Palestine. In response, the administration readied state troopers and local police officers in riot gear,\" Anya Epstein, a sophomore public health and psychology student.\n\nThroughout the rally, the demonstrators chanted, \"Who keeps us safe? We keep us safe!\"\n\nMany speakers voiced mistreatment and improper use of force by police officers while being arrested, the Collegian is looking to verify these claims.\n\nKevin Young, a tenured associate professor of history, was arrested at the encampment. He also spoke at the rally, saying: \"I was honored to be a part of or at least a witness to the student negotiating team that met with the administration in Draper Hall yesterday evening.\"\n\nYoung described the negotiating team on behalf of divestment as \"informed, they were reasonable, and they were ready to negotiate in good faith.\"\n\nHazeyen was also in the room and said: \"He started the meeting with a closing statement. He started up being like, 'we cannot give you what you want. We cannot divest. We cannot disclose. I can't do anything,' and that's how he started it.\"\n\n\"It was two hours of just nothing. Just going around in circles, not answering any of our questions, begging us to take the encampment down, and giving us nothing in turn. It was awful,\" added Hazeyen.\n\n\"We learned midway through the meeting that Chancellor Reyes had ordered the deployment of the police while we were in the meeting. So that was another gesture of bad faith,\" said Young.\n\n\"I told Chancellor Reyes I hope you have a good PR team to try to explain what you're about to do to the students,\" said Hazeyen. \"I told him that if he unleashes cops onto this campus, there will be a lot more hurt, and there will be a lot more violence.\"\n\nReyes released an email to the UMass community later that evening that addressed the meeting. \"I impressed upon the student protest leaders that their encampment must be removed and offered to continue ongoing discussions in the weeks and months ahead to bridge our differences,\" the statement read.\n\n\"While we may not agree to all the demands presented to us today, including those which would violate the university's founding values of the free and open exchange of ideas, today's meeting could have been a significant step forward in in establishing a meaningful dialogue,\" the statement read. \"While we have told demonstrators that failure to remove the tents and barriers may result in arrests, this is not the outcome we had hoped for.\"\n\nWhen asked if Young was afraid of facing consequences from administration, he said, \"Any risk I am incurring as a faculty member pales in comparison to what other people are suffering through right now, in Gaza most of all. So it seems like a very small risk to incur on behalf of peace.\"\n\nThe rally concluded at around 4:30 p.m. with the organizers urging those present at the protest, specifically those arrested, to meet in small groups to process and discuss the possibly traumatic experience with police at the encampment.\n\nAt 6 p.m. SJP, FJP, UMass Dissenters and YCL held a press conference outside the Student Union. The panel was made up of Hazeyen, Sheher Bano and Tatiana Rodriguez, who are both doctorate students and Graduate Employee Organization Palestine Solidarity Caucus members, and Hoang Phan, an English professor and FJP member.\n\nAll panelists called for Reyes to resign immediately.\n\n\"Chancellor Reyes resign right now. We have no confidence in your leadership,\" Phan said. \"He brought the violence to the broader public. The community. This is a public university. This belongs to the public, the students, the staff, the faculty that run this university...his legacy will be that he is on the wrong side of history.\"\n\n\"[UMass FJP] formed specifically after our students here at this university staged their peaceful, nonviolent sit-in at the Whitmore Administration Building last fall, we formed to support our students, defend our students, amplify their message, their message of divestment from this war machine,\" Phan explained.\n\nYesterday, when Reyes met with student protest organizers to discuss their demands amidst the demonstration, Hazeyen, who was at the negotiating table said, \"[The chancellor] explicitly said that the cops would only be employed to protect the students and let it be known that all the cops did was cause the violence on all the students.\"\n\nReyes said in his emailed statement that day that \"involving law enforcement is the absolute last resort.\"\n\n\"What happened in the meeting was I was called 'sweetheart' in the most condescending manner. I was interrupted every time I would talk as the only Palestinian woman in the room....we were not listened to every time we tried to say something, we were met with 'I can't, I can't'...until finally one thing that we got out of him was 'I won't,'\" she added.\n\nAccording to Hazeyen, Reyes claimed he didn't have any decision-making power to meet their demands but refused when they suggested he encourage members of the UMass Board of Trustees to review the protestors' demands and release a statement in support of their movement.\n\nIn Reyes' email, he indicated that the Board of Trustees agreed to consider the UMass Amherst student trustee's petition calling for divestment from defense-related firms in June but that the offer was rejected by the representatives of the encampment.\n\n\"We have provided many paths forward for a resolution, including in our discussions today with protest representatives. Our message to this effect was delivered to the demonstrators in the encampment by the Demonstration Response and Safety Team,\" continued the statement.\n\nThe message provided by DRST and presented to demonstrators indicated that the item to address divestment would be put on the Board of Trustee meeting agenda and that an endowment divestment proposal would be reviewed by the UMass Foundation.\n\nThe letter then instructed demonstrators to remove their tents and structures and informed they were trespassing. \"You have the right to express your views but you do not have a right to place structures outside the limits of the land use policy.\"\n\n\"I mean, [the police presence had] a level of violence I have never seen in my life, and it was because of the Chancellor,\" said Hazeyen. \"He will not get another day of peace on this campus until he resigns.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycollegian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Massachusetts Daily Collegian"}, "authors":

Of those arrested, about 70 were UMass Amherst students and six were UMass Amherst faculty, according to the university. Another 56 weren't students or faculty.\n\nUMass Amherst Chancellor Javier Reyes sent a message to the university community Wednesday saying he made the \"difficult decision\" to call the police to \"clear the site of an unauthorized fortified encampment on the university grounds.\n\n\"As chancellor, ensuring the safety and well-being of our students and other members of our campus community is one of my most important duties,\" he wrote. \"A safe and respectful learning environment is foundational to enabling free expression and the exchange of ideas - including through peaceful demonstrations.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Teachers Association criticized the arrests and said it \"condemns\" the public university's \"restraints on academic freedom and crackdown on the free speech rights of students, staff and faculty on campus.\"\n\n\"The use of force to silence protests is antithetical to the reason why universities - and especially public universities - exist,\" MTA co-president Max Page wrote. \"We urge UMass to disavow and discontinue actions that threaten the safety and well-being of students, staff and faculty engaged in lawful protest.\"\n\nReyes said he has met several times with student protestors and acknowledges \"there is work to do as we restore trust with those who feel harmed by the university's actions.\"\n\nStephen Karam, chairman of the UMass board of trustees, said the board has \"full and unwavering support\" for Reyes' actions.\n\n\"We have absolute confidence in his leadership, his integrity and his commitment to our students,\" Karam said.\n\nThe Massachusetts chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union also blasted the university's actions and reports that police \"may have attempted to shield their activity from press and legal observers\" which it said \"raise additional concerns about press freedom and transparency, which are essential to accountability.\"\n\n\"When universities choose to involve police in nonviolent demonstrations, it escalates tensions and creates unacceptable safety risks for all students, faculty and community members,\" Carol Rose, the ACLU of MA's executive director, said in a statement. \"Calling heavily armed police on student political expression is an inherently dangerous choice.\"\n\nUMass Amherst's five largest employee unions -- AFSCME Local 1776, the Graduate Employee Organization, the Massachusetts Society of Professors, the Professional Staff Union, and the University Staff Association -- issued a joint statement also condemning the crackdown on campus.\n\nThe demonstrations are part of a wave of anti-Israel protests that have swept U.S. college campuses over the past week in response to Israel's war in Gaza, which was prompted by the Oct. 6 attack by the terrorist group Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis. Hamas also took hostages, many of whom are still in captivity.\n\nHundreds of arrests have been made at Columbia, MIT, Harvard, Yale and other elite universities as campus police and law enforcement officials are called in to take down the make-shift encampments, which violate school policies.\n\nChristian M.

Police clashed with protesters gathered in solidarity with Palestine, leading to 132 arrests, the university confirmed Wednesday night. Of those, UMass estimated 70 were students at the university and six were faculty.\n\n\"The UMass Student Government Association on behalf of the undergraduate students, affirm that they have no confidence in the leadership of Chancellor Reyes,\" the SGA wrote on Instagram.\n\nPrior to the vote, Reyes released a statement saying he had spoken with many on campus Wednesday, discussing \"the events of last night and the previous encampment, along with processes and policies related to student discipline.\"\n\nReyes asked student government leaders and the Faculty Senate to call meetings where he and other school leaders \"can engage in dialogue and answer questions about this challenging episode.\"\n\n\"I know how challenging these events have been for everyone. Safety, wellbeing, and a sense of belonging are paramount for our community's ability to thrive, and I recognize that there is work to do as we restore trust with those who feel harmed by the university's actions,\" Reyes said in the statement.\n\nIn response to the \"no confidence\" vote, a university spokesperson released words of support for Reyes from UMass Board of Trustees Chair Stephen Karam and Marty Meehan, the president of the UMass system.\n\n\"The circumstances on the Amherst campus are in no way isolated and are part of a national trend taking place on college and university campuses across the country,\" Meehan said. \"Chancellor Reyes and his team have engaged in good faith discussions, offered meaningful paths to a resolution, and done everything within their power to engage sincerely and protect students' rights to free speech.\n\nMcGovern: 'You don't arrest peaceful protesters'\n\nEarlier Wednesday, hundreds of students gathered again, outside the student union, to reaffirm their opposition to the war in Gaza, the university's ties to military contractors, and the arrests the night before. Students for Justice in Palestine, an organizer of both protests, circulated a petition calling for Reyes' resignation.\n\nAt the same time, the five largest labor unions representing campus staff and faculty criticized the decision to bring in police, as did the ACLU of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Jim McGovern.\n\nMcGovern on Thursday morning told NEPM's The Fabulous 413 that he has received a lot of calls from concerned constituents. He said he has spoken with administrators at UMass about the situation, but not Reyes directly.\n\n\"I expressed my concern about what happened. I regret that police were brought onto the campus and all the arrests that happened. I'm a strong believer in the right to peaceful protest. It's a hallmark of our history,\" McGovern said. \"And I'm a believer that at this very tenuous and challenging moment, we have to be about listening to one another. We have to be about letting people in rather than shutting people out. But it also means that you don't arrest peaceful protesters.\"\n\nMcGovern, a Worcester Democrat whose district include Amherst, acknowledged he did not know all the details that led to the arrests.\n\n\"The university has their own rationale for doing what they did, including concerns about public safety and on and on and on and on. But ... to the best of my knowledge, these protesters were not engaged in any violent activities. They were not disrupting or interrupting peoples' ability to get to class or take their final exams,\" he said. \"I find the whole thing very concerning.\"\n\nMcGovern said he also protested while he was a college student -- even at his own graduation, when his alma mater, American University, chose a controversial economist in the Reagan Administration.\n\nBut the congressman, who spoke at Reyes' inauguration as UMass chancellor in late April, had encouraging words for the campus leader.\n\n\"I'm excited about Chancellor Reyes as chancellor. I think he will do a good job. I just regret that this was kind of the first thing out of the box.\"\n\nNEPM's Nirvani Williams and Monte Belmonte contributed to this report.\n\nDisclosure: The license for NEPM's main radio signal is held by UMass Amherst.

Hamas also took hostages, many of whom are still in captivity.\n\nHundreds of arrests have been made at Columbia, MIT, Harvard, Yale and other elite universities as campus police and law enforcement officials are called in to take down the make-shift encampments, which violate school policies.\n\nChristian M.

The red tier consists of roughly 15 people inside an enclosed area made of wooden crates, who say they are willing to be arrested. The orange tier consists of a group of student protestors circled around the enclosed area linking arms that are willing to interact with police but not be arrested. The last tier of people surrounding the encampment across the lawn are involved in the protest but say they are not willing to be arrested.\n\nNear the W.E.B. DuBois Library, counter-protestors gathered, waving the flag of Israel.\n\nAround 2 p.m., a police car could be seen near the Old Chapel, which left around 2:15 p.m. A police officer was spotted at approximately 2:15 p.m. by the library. There were about 300 people at this time.\n\nAt approximately 3:20 p.m., five representatives from the UMass administration arrived at the encampment and issued another warning for trespassing. Ruya Hazeyen, the president of SJP, confirmed that a meeting with Chancellor Javier Reyes will occur at an unconfirmed time, following the warnings from administration. However, SJP claims that if any encampment participants get arrested, then all negotiations are off.\n\nAccording to University Spokesperson Edward Blaguszewski, the Chancellor has agreed to meet privately with a small number of representatives from the encampment and a small number of senior members of the Chancellor's staff. \"Details beyond this stage I do not have at the time,\" he said.\n\nThis is an ongoing story and more updates will be provided.", "source": {"uri": "dailycollegian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Massachusetts Daily Collegian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois_Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "W.

When the leadership of a university as massive and prestigious as the University of Massachusetts changes hands, the community has a right to know their new leader and have their questions answered. We interviewed former Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy on his way out, so it was only right to interview Reyes on his way in.\n\nI had a great time speaking with Reyes. He had a warm, comforting smile and would work through questions in a way that made me feel satisfied with his answers. He talked about how he disliked wearing suits, how he loves to display his Marvel action figures in his office and how he values having regular pizza dinners with students at his house to get to know the community.\n\nOn May 7, Reyes authorized State Police, UMass Police Department and Amherst Police Department forces to crush an encampment constructed by students, faculty and community members protesting Israel's invasion of Gaza and the University's ties to defense contractors. Our reporters were eyewitnesses to the gratuitous police brutality that Reyes' authorization caused.\n\nWithin 24 hours of the protest, the Student Government Association held an overwhelming vote of no confidence in Reyes' leadership. I have no doubt that Reyes will spend the rest of the spring semester trying to clean up his image, both to the community and University shareholders. I'm sure that he will try to distance himself from the police violence - after all, he wasn't the one on South Lawn beating up students.\n\nUnfortunately for the UMass administration, they made a terrible mistake by supplying police officers with campus resources to extinguish the protest. Throughout the night, police used UMass Waste Management trucks to set up light towers to light the area, a PVTA bus to transport arrested protesters and the Mullins Center as a holding cell. I was, and still am, shocked by this decision.\n\nThey turned our incredible public transportation system into a prisoner transport system.\n\nThey turned the event hall that hosts artists and student athletes into a detention center. In one week, I will graduate above the basement used to detain students.\n\nThere is something uniquely sickening about seeing resources used for sport, accessible transportation and entertainment being retrofitted by a violent contingent of police officers. When I first saw students being led onto a PVTA bus, my mind immediately went to a scene in \"The Handmaid's Tale\" where Fenway Park was used as a location for a fake public execution. In this scene, Boston's strongest pillar of pride and entertainment was used to psychologically torture protesters. Even though it was fiction, it's still hard to look at the Green Monster the same way today.\n\nWhen I see a police badge, I understand that for many communities, the badge is a symbol of violence and repression. I'm saddened, but not surprised when I see someone wearing that badge use excessive force on a protester. When I see a PVTA bus, I know that anyone anywhere in the Amherst community can get a free, safe and accessible ride to where they need to go. I'm horrified when I see this fixture of our community used by the police, transporting student protesters to the Mullins Detention Center.\n\nSymbols as ubiquitous as the PVTA logo and spaces as multifaceted as the Mullins Center hold incredible power in our community. When you disrespect that power, you disrespect our community. When I toured UMass, I saw the Mullins Center as an exciting place to watch concerts and hockey games. Now, I will forever think of the Mullins Detention Center as the location where UMass students were handcuffed for hours by a violent contingent of police.\n\nWith that said, I'd like to speak to you, Chancellor Reyes, because I know you occasionally read our publication and you were a great listener the last time we talked.\n\nI know how hard it is to fit into a community, especially one as complex and diverse as UMass. I know what it's like to lead a large group of students and make difficult decisions that may upset colleagues, friends and community members. I also know that this is your first year on campus - you're a freshman. Trust me, I know how scary and exciting it is, I was a freshman once too.\n\nOne time, I sat down in a dining hall and ignored the UCard that was on the table - I thought someone had just left it there. When the person on the card appeared at the table with a full plate of food, I handed them their card and told them they lost it. The person laughed, sat down across from me and explained how people reserved seats in the dining hall. We laughed together, I apologized and I made sure to respect the custom moving forward.\n\nRight now, it looks like you don't really understand or respect our customs. That's okay, you're a freshman - no one's expecting you to be perfect during your first year. When I didn't follow the UCard rule, I didn't know any better. I wasn't trying to disrespect the custom - maybe this situation is one big misunderstanding as well.\n\nMaybe you didn't realize that police using campus resources would cause such a disturbing effect. Maybe you're also horrified that you're going to be speaking at the Mullins Detention Center in a week.

An administration should never call the police on its own students, especially those engaged in peaceful protest. In this Op-Ed we report facts that may be absent from the wider discussion being had on campus about what actually took place. We believe these facts elicit the strong possibility of a vote of no confidence against Chancellor Reyes. This is a logical outcome due of the administration's failure to negotiate with members of faculty and student communities in good faith regarding the demand to divest from weapons manufacturers, its reliance on state police -- rather than further discussion -- as a means of dispersing protest, and its lack of a principled commitment to free speech.\n\nThe reason for the encampments at UMass has been to ask the University to end its investments in and relationships with companies like Raytheon Technologies, DCS Corporation and General Dynamics, all of which produce and supply weapons to the state of Israel, which is using in its genocidal campaign against Palestinians in Gaza. While this is the instigating moment and central aim of the encampments, the wider issue is the need for the University to divest from war profiteering writ large. This is part of a wider campaign that is taking place in universities all over the world.\n\nOver 130 individuals were arrested while protesting peacefully. We are particularly shocked to see videos of police physically charging at, body slamming and verbally assaulting people who were in the encampment, as well as those on the sidelines who were chanting and supporting those who had chosen to risk arrest in order to move negotiations with the administration forward. The administration called in 117 police vehicles. Hundreds of officers were on campus in riot gear. People were in zip ties for 12 hours. Police had started to assemble behind Whitmore, UMass's main administration building, while Chancellor Reyes was ostensibly negotiating with faculty and student liaisons about the campaign for divestment. The lack of transparency about calling police leads us to conclude that these negotiations were not being conducted in good faith.\n\nRegardless of whether you agree with the message of the protestors, there is a long history of student activism on campus. UMass itself has a history of both tolerating and encouraging protest encampments, e.g. in 2012 during Occupy Wallstreet. A statement released by the American Historical Association notes that:\n\n\"Historical thinking reminds us that the use of force to suppress peaceful public protest at institutions of higher education endangers students, faculty, and staff. This month marks the 54th anniversary of the killing of students by National Guard troops at Kent State University, and by local and state police at Jackson State College. Those terrible events, along with the infamous 'Orangeburg Massacre' of 1968, teach us that the introduction of outside armed law enforcement, and even worse, military units, escalates tensions rather than leads to constructive resolution of disputes.\"\n\nThere are now threats to suspend students for a semester who were arrested both in late October during a sit-in in Whitmore and in May. We call on the administration to dismiss all charges against the 'UMass 57' as well as dismissing any charges against students who were arrested in the course of setting up and supporting the second encampment. Past practice was to tolerate and even support encampments, because universities are labs for democracy and the freedom of speech. Instead, there is video of students being grabbed and thrown to the ground by police, while the University is under investigation by the Department of Education for anti-Palestinian bias. It is not too late to change course. We ask the campus community to understand the disturbing nature of what is taking place and to work together to restore democratic governance to our campus.\n\nSigned,\n\nThe faculty of the Department of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies", "source": {"uri": "dailycollegian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Massachusetts Daily Collegian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Use of force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_Technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raytheon Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_profiteering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War profiteering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeburg_massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orangeburg massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Historical_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Historical Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupy Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kent State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://dailycollegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/53706741746_65e2a7d5c0_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549436", "eventUri": "eng-9549436", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 293, "textEnd": 298}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The central bank said in its Monetary Policy Report that for much of the past year, inflation excluding shelter was running around 2 per cent, \"well below its historical average.\"\n\nThe Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday for the second consecutive time, a widely expected move that brings its policy rate to 4.5 per cent.\n\nEconomists had expected the central bank to cut its key rate in the wake of slowing inflation, rising slack in the labour market and weak economic growth. Money markets had priced in an 86 per cent probability of a cut as of Tuesday, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\"In recent months, we have continued to make progress bringing inflation down. With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations,\" Governor Tiff Macklem said in a prepared opening statement.\n\n\"We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much, even as we work to get inflation down to the 2 per cent target.\"\n\nMacklem noted that while the central bank expects inflation to moderate further, progress over the next year \"will likely be uneven.\" Opposing forces are affecting inflation, he said, with weakness in the economy pulling it down while high prices for shelter and in some services push inflation up.\n\n\"We are increasingly confident that the ingredients to bring inflation back to target are in place,\" Macklem said.\n\n\"But the push-pull of these opposing forces means the decline in inflation will likely be gradual, and there could be setbacks along the way.\"\n\nThe emphasis on the potential downside risks to inflation mark a shift in language for the Bank of Canada, which stressed during its last monetary policy decision in June that cutting rates too quickly could jeopardize progress made on lowering inflation.\n\nStill, Macklem reiterated on Wednesday that if inflation continues to ease in line with the Bank's forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts to its policy interest rate.\n\nThe Bank of Canada also released its quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) on Wednesday, and said it expects inflation to fall to 2.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year and hit 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The central bank said inflation will settle \"sustainably\" at 2 per cent in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe bank expects economic growth to pick up in the second half of the year, with real GDP hitting 2.8 per cent in the third quarter. However, it noted that growth remains weak relative to population growth.

Money markets had priced in an 86 per cent probability of a cut as of Tuesday, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\"In recent months, we have continued to make progress bringing inflation down. With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations,\" Governor Tiff Macklem said in a prepared opening statement.\n\n\"We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much, even as we work to get inflation down to the 2 per cent target.\"\n\nMacklem noted that while the central bank expects inflation to moderate further, progress over the next year \"will likely be uneven.\" Opposing forces are affecting inflation, he said, with weakness in the economy pulling it down while high prices for shelter and in some services push inflation up.\n\n\"We are increasingly confident that the ingredients to bring inflation back to target are in place,\" Macklem said.\n\n\"But the push-pull of these opposing forces means the decline in inflation will likely be gradual, and there could be setbacks along the way.\"\n\nThe emphasis on the potential downside risks to inflation mark a shift in language for the Bank of Canada, which stressed during its last monetary policy decision in June that cutting rates too quickly could jeopardize progress made on lowering inflation.\n\nStill, Macklem reiterated on Wednesday that if inflation continues to ease in line with the Bank's forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts to its policy interest rate.\n\nThe Bank of Canada also released its quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) on Wednesday, and said it expects inflation to fall to 2.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year and hit 2.4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The central bank said inflation will settle \"sustainably\" at 2 per cent in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe bank expects economic growth to pick up in the second half of the year, with real GDP hitting 2.8 per cent in the third quarter. However, it noted that growth remains weak relative to population growth. Pent-up demand for vehicles and travel has slowed, and households are using more of their income to servicing debt payments, leaving less money for discretionary spending.\n\nWednesday's decision marks the second consecutive cut from the Bank of Canada.

Last month's cut from 5 per cent to 4.75 per cent was the first in more than four years.\n\nBank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said the decision was based on economic data showing slack in the labour market, excess supply in the economy and inflation continuing to drop.\n\n\"We are increasingly confident that the ingredients to bring inflation back to target are in place,\" Macklem said in his opening remarks.\n\nSince the Bank of Canada started raising rates in March 2022 inflation has dropped from a peak of 8.1 per cent in June 2022 to 2.7 per cent in June 2024, after a slight increase in May.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect inflation to moderate further, though progress over the next year will likely be uneven,\" Macklem said.\n\nIf inflation continues to ease as expected, Macklem signalled Canadians can expect more rate cuts. Those decisions, he said, will be taken one decision at a time.\n\n\"If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate,\" Macklem said. \"The timing will depend on how we see these opposing forces place out.\"\n\nMany economists and big banks expect the bank could cut rates as many as four times by the end of 2024. The speed of those cuts will likely depend on how quickly peers at the Bank of England and the United States Federal Reserve cut rates. Last month, the Bank of Canada became the first Group of Seven central banks to do so since the pandemic began.\n\nThe central bank expects broad inflationary pressures to continue easing, with the bank's preferred measures of core inflation now consistently below 3 per cent and expected to slow to about 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2024.\n\nIn its Monetary Policy Report the central bank highlights concerns that inflation is being held up by high shelter costs, driven by rent and mortgage interest costs, as well as by services that are closely affected by wages, such as restaurants and personal care. While few details were provided, the monetary report warns that \"housing market imbalances\" will continue to put upward pressure on inflation throughout much of the projected horizon.\n\n\"We are carefully assessing the downward pull on inflation from ongoing excess supply, and the pressures from shelter and other services that are holding inflation up,\" Macklem said. \"Monetary policy decisions will be guided by incoming information and our assessment of their implications for the inflation outlook.\"\n\nThe next rate decision is on Sept. 4.\n\nAfter having stalled in the second half of 2023, gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by roughly 1.75 per cent in the first quarter of 2024, driven by strong population growth.\n\nThe central bank predicts economic growth will continue to increase in the second half of 2024 as interest rates ease and household and business confidence rise. Due to what the bank expects will be slower population growth, GDP growth is projected to be about 2.1 per cent in 2025 and 2.4 per cent in 2026.\n\nAs GDP grows, the central bank expects core inflation to ease to about 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2024 and, due to a temporary decline in gasoline prices, it expects consumer price index (CPI) inflation to come down below core inflation during the same time frame. The bank, however, does warn that getting to target will be \"bumpy\" in the short term, with CPI inflation expected to rise slightly in the first half of 2025 before settling again at 2 per cent in the second half of 2025.\n\nConsumption per person is expected to grow, though the bank says there is much uncertainty here given some mortgage holders will have to renew at a higher interest rate, and some variable-rate mortgage holders with fixed payments will have to deal with higher principle payments once they re-amortize.\n\nAmong the biggest factors that could hold up inflation are global geopolitical developments, such as new international trade disruptions stemming from global conflicts like the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\nThe bank says those conflicts could impact commodity prices and impede the supply of traded goods. If global shipping routes are attacked, the bank says producer costs could increase and the return to the inflation target delayed.\n\nAnother major concern is shelter price inflation, which right now sits above its historical average around 7 per cent. The bank fears shelter prices could remain high for longer than expected, in part because stronger-than-usual population growth and a shortage of houses is keeping vacancy rates at record lows.\n\nThe bank's latest monetary policy report includes a section about the impact of newcomers on the Canadian economy, especially on the housing market and shelter inflation.\n\nOver the past two years, Canada's population has grown by 6 per cent, almost all of which is due to the arrival of newcomers. During this time the bank says GDP per capita has been soft, largely held up by population growth.\n\nThe central bank says newcomers have provided a boost to consumer spending and have significantly boosted the economy's potential for non-inflationary growth, adding an estimated 2.5 per cent to the level of potential output.\n\nHowever, the bank says the overall impact of newcomers to the labour market may be lower than expected as many newcomers have faced significant challenges finding jobs.\n\nWhen it comes to housing, the central bank says strong population growth has boosted demand for housing, adding existing pressures to rent and house prices. While the increase in demand from newcomers is being felt across the sector, the bank says the greatest impact tends to be in rental markets.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_output", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Potential output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/7/24/bank-of-canada-1-6975424-1721818548981.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 2777, "textEnd": 2784}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem speaks during a news conference on the Bank of Canada's rate announcement, in Ottawa, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin TangOTTAWA - The Bank of Canada appeared to be increasingly concerned about the risk of high interest rates slowing the economy and inflation by more than necessary as it delivered a second consecutive rate cut Wednesday. The central bank's decision to lower its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point was widely expected by economists, given the continued easing in inflation and weak economic conditions. Its key interest rate now stands at 4.5 per cent. During a news conference, governor Tiff Macklem said that as inflation edges closer to the two per cent target, the risks associated with keeping interest rates high become more important for the central bank to consider. He noted that undershooting the inflation target would be just as concerning as overshooting it. \"That need for growth to pick up was something that was part of our decision to cut the policy interest rate today,\" Macklem added. The Bank of Canada's emphasis on the state of the economy and the risk of keeping rates high for too long suggested to economists that more interest rate cuts could come sooner rather than later. \"It is definitely a clear shift in tone,\" said BMO chief economist Douglas Porter. \"It almost does seem like now the bias is to continue cutting. They almost need to be persuaded not to keep cutting, I think.\" Although Macklem would not say what exactly the future path of rates may look like, he did signal there may be some curveballs along the way. More specifically, the path back to two per cent inflation likely won't be a straight line, he said. \"The overall weakness in the economy is pulling inflation down. At the same time, price pressures in shelter and some other services are holding inflation up,\"\u009d Macklem said. Although the governor said the Bank of Canada is \"increasingly confident\"\u009d that inflation is headed back to target, the push and pull between those opposing forces could affect the pace at which price growth eases. \"If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate. The timing will depend on how we see these opposing forces playing out,\"\u009d he said. \"In other words, we will take our monetary policy decisions one at a time.\"\u009d The Bank of Canada delivered its first interest rate cut in four years last month, marking a major turning point in its battle against high inflation. High borrowing costs have caused a pullback in spending by both consumers and businesses, which economists say has helped take the pressure off price growth. Canada's annual inflation rate fell back to 2.7 per cent in June after temporarily flaring up in May. The Bank of Canada's monetary policy report released Wednesday includes new forecasts, which suggest inflation will return to the two per cent target next year. The Canadian economy, which the central bank notes remains weak relative to population growth, is expected to strengthen in the second half of 2024. Real gross domestic product is expected to grow on average by 1.2 per cent this year, followed by 2.1 per cent in 2025. The central bank's next interest rate decision is scheduled for Sept. 4.

This is the second cut in a long-awaited monetary policy easing cycle, and comes after the bank raised interest rates 10 times in 2022 and 2023 to tackle the most serious bout of inflation in a generation.\n\nPrice pressures have eased over the past two years, as global supply chains have improved, economic growth has stalled and restrictive interest rates have curbed consumer spending. That's led the bank to adopt a more balanced approach to monetary policy in its latest rate decision, teeing up additional interest rate cuts later this year.\n\n\"As inflation gets closer to the 2-per-cent target, the risk that inflation comes in higher than expected has to be increasingly balanced against the risk that the economy and inflation could be weaker than expected,\" Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said, according to the prepared text of his press conference opening statement.\n\nHe said that it is \"reasonable\" to expect additional rate cuts if inflation continues trending lower, as the central bank is forecasting. But he said that the bank's governing council will be \"taking our monetary policy decisions one at a time.\"\n\nThe annual rate of consumer price index inflation has been below 3 per cent since the start of year, coming in at 2.7 per cent in June, down from a peak of 8.1 per cent in 2022. The bank's updated forecast sees inflation falling below 2.5 per cent in the second half of the year and settling \"sustainably\" at 2 per cent next year.\n\nMuted demand for goods and services, alongside rising unemployment and a weakening labour market, is pulling inflation lower.\n\nHowever, there are still some areas where price pressures remain, including for rent, mortgage interest costs and services that are sensitive to wage increases. And the bank warned geopolitical turmoil, trade disruptions and political risks, such as new tariffs, could put upward pressure on inflation.\n\n\"We are increasingly confident that the ingredients to bring inflation back to target are in place. But the push-pull of these opposing forces means the decline in inflation will likely be gradual, and there could be setbacks along the way,\" Mr. Macklem said.\n\nSo far, inflation has returned to normal levels without the Canadian economy falling into a recession. That looks like a soft-landing, which many economists thought was impossible a year ago.\n\nHowever, the country's positive gross domestic product growth is largely a result of a rapid increase in population. On a per-person basis, GDP has declined for the past year-and-a-half.\n\nGDP growth came in weaker-than-expected in the first half of the year. In its quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR), published Wednesday, the bank chalked this up to slowing demand for vehicles and travel, as well as muted consumer spending on discretionary goods as households put more money towards servicing their debt.\n\nThe MPR sees economic growth picking up in the second half of the year and through 2025. Annual GDP growth is expected to be 1.2 per cent this year, before rising to 2.1 per cent in 2025 and 2.4 per cent in 2026\n\n\"This reflects stronger exports and a recovery in household spending as borrowing costs ease. Business investment is also expected to strength as demand picks up, and residential investment is forecast to grow robustly,\" Mr. Macklem said.\n\n\"Overall, with the economy strengthening, excess supply will be absorbed next year and into 2026.\"\n\nWednesday's rate cut will be welcomed by homeowners with variable rate mortgages, which track changes in the central bank's policy rate. Interest rates for fixed-rate mortgages, which are based on yields in bond markets, may move less.\n\nEither way, housing affordability will remain stretched until interest rates fall further, and analysts are not expecting an immediate rebound in the housing market.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/MWUNAGBD2RD6FL3R2CCLFWK4AE.jpg?auth=c9f6bde7dbfb94ff1a13b540a83f557b7d82f32c261d40d0d0baa1789c7ac779&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

I'm pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss the July Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and today's policy announcement.\n\n\"Today, we lowered our policy interest rate a further 25 basis points to 4.5%.\n\n\"This decision reflects three key considerations.\n\n\"First, monetary policy is working to ease broad price pressures.\n\n\"Second, with the economy in excess supply and slack in the labour market, the economy has more room to grow without creating inflationary pressures.\n\n\"Third, as inflation gets closer to the 2% target, the risk that inflation comes in higher than expected has to be increasingly balanced against the risk that the economy and inflation could be weaker than expected.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect inflation to moderate further, though progress over the next year will likely be uneven. This forecast reflects the opposing forces affecting inflation. The overall weakness in the economy is pulling inflation down. At the same time, price pressures in shelter and some other services are holding inflation up. We are increasingly confident that the ingredients to bring inflation back to target are in place. But the push-pull of these opposing forces means the decline in inflation will likely be gradual, and there could be setbacks along the way.\n\n\"If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate. The timing will depend on how we see these opposing forces playing out. In other words, we will be taking our monetary policy decisions one at a time.\n\n\"Let me highlight some of the economic dynamics covered more fully in the MPR.\n\n\"Economic growth in Canada has picked up but remains weak relative to population growth. Household spending has been soft. Pent-up demand for things like new cars and travel is fading. And many families are setting aside more of their income for debt payments, leaving less money for discretionary spending.\n\n\"In the labour market, employment has continued to grow more slowly than the labour force. Job seekers are now taking longer to find work, and the unemployment rate has risen to 6.4%. The job vacancy rate has come down significantly, and reports of labour shortages are now below normal. Overall indicators suggest some slack in the labour market. Wage growth is also showing signs of moderating, although it remains elevated.\n\n\"Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to increase in the second half of 2024 and through 2025. This reflects stronger exports and a recovery in household spending as borrowing costs ease. Business investment is also expected to strengthen as demand picks up, and residential investment is forecast to grow robustly. Overall, with the economy strengthening, excess supply will be absorbed next year and into 2026.\n\nCPI inflation moderated to 2.7% in June after increasing in May, and broad inflationary pressures continued to ease. The Bank\u00b4s preferred measures of core inflation have now been below 3% for several months and the breadth of price increases across components of the CPI is near its historical average. Corporate pricing behaviour has largely normalized, and near-term inflation expectations have come down, although they are still above normal. However, shelter price inflation remains high. Inflationary pressures are also evident in services that are closely affected by wages, such as restaurants and personal care.\n\n\"The Bank's preferred measures of core inflation are expected to slow to about 2\u00bd% in the second half of 2024 and ease further in 2025. CPI inflation is forecast to come down below core this fall and settle sustainably around the 2% target next year, but it's unlikely to be a straight line.\n\n\"As always, there are risks around our inflation outlook. Globally, geopolitical uncertainty is high. Here in Canada, the biggest downside risk is that household spending could be weaker than expected. On the upside, inflation in shelter and other services could prove more persistent.\n\n\"Let me conclude. With broad price pressures continuing to ease and inflation expected to move closer to the 2% target, Governing Council decided to reduce the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points.\n\n\"In recent months, we have continued to make progress bringing inflation down. With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations. We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much, even as we work to get inflation down to the 2% target.\n\n\"We are carefully assessing the downward pull on inflation from ongoing excess supply, and the pressures from shelter and other services that are holding inflation up. Monetary policy decisions will be guided by incoming information and our assessment of their implications for the inflation outlook. The Bank remains resolute in its commitment to restoring price stability for Canadians.\n\n\"With that summary, the Senior Deputy Governor and I would be pleased to take your questions.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren, editing by Promit Mukherjee)\n\nKeywords: CANADA CENBANK/MACKLEM", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Excess supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Howe Institute, where Steve Ambler, a professor of economics at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, is the David Dodge Chair in Monetary Policy.\n\nWhen headline inflation increased to 2.9 per cent in May, up from 2.7 per cent in April, there was much speculation that the Bank of Canada would pause its rate cuts. However, it ticked back down to 2.7 per cent in June. That, plus a weakening labour market and stagnating per capita GDP, made it practically certain the bank would cut on Wednesday. It did.\n\nWhether the bank has entered an easing cycle is no longer the question. The only question left is how far and how fast the Bank of Canada continues to cut interest rates.\n\nThere are several upside risks to inflation in the near future which could cause the bank to pause its rate cuts. We think it shouldn't. Here's why.\n\nThe first upside risk comes from volatility in the shorter-term inflation numbers. This is due to certain components of the consumer price index (CPI). For example, energy prices in general and especially gasoline prices fluctuate a lot depending on conditions in the rest of the world, both economic and geopolitical.\n\nA shorter-term indicator - inflation over the last month, or over the last three months - has the advantage of excluding what was happening to inflation more than six months ago - which the year-over-year measures the bank targets cannot. Therefore, it can sometimes give a better indication of where inflation is headed in the near to medium term. Unfortunately, these numbers can vary quite a bit from month to month.\n\nOverall CPI inflation throughout the last month was under one per cent (all inflation numbers reported here are in annualized terms), which is encouraging, but was above three per cent in both March and May, after having fallen below zero in the first month of this year.\n\nEven core inflation, which is supposed to abstract from the more volatile components of inflation, has moved a lot from month to month. Both CPI-Median and CPI-Trim inflation over the last month - the core numbers followed closely by the bank - were high (2.9 per cent), and both were over four per cent in May.\n\nThis is where longer-term trends matter. The six-month rates can move us away from where things were six months ago, giving us a more accurate picture of where things stand today, and can also deal with the volatility of month-over-month or three-month inflation measures. And here CPI-Trim and CPI-Median are clearly on a downward trend, at 2.2 and 2.1 per cent respectively in June. The bank should ignore the short-term swings and focus on the trend.\n\nThe second upside risk comes from some components of the CPI which have shown persistently high inflation. One of the most important of these is shelter. Shelter inflation was above six per cent over the last 12 months, and 3.7 per cent over the last month.\n\nTwo components have driven this high inflation - rent and mortgage interest costs. Rent is driven by structural factors like immigration and barriers to supply, e.g. zoning restrictions, that are out of the bank's control. Mortgage interest costs, on the other hand, are driven by the bank's own interest rate hikes over the last two years that will, eventually, fall out of the calculation. Without mortgage interest costs, inflation is 1.9 per cent, right at target.\n\nFinally, there are substantial upside risks to inflation stemming from geopolitics. The most notable of these is the possibility of a change in government in the U.S. after the November election. This comes with the threat of a renegotiation of the Canada-United States-Mexico trade agreement (CUSMA) and a push for de-globalization. Tariffs by the U.S., and retaliatory tariffs imposed by Canada and/or other countries from which we import, would increase inflation.\n\nSuch an increase would be temporary as prices would shift to a higher level, and then inflation would continue as before but on a higher price path. The Bank of Canada can do nothing about this kind of inflation, short of a monetary policy restrictive enough to push prices down in order to compensate for the one-time impact of the tariffs. If it does not want to do this - and it shouldn't - the bank can use its communication tools with the public to explain why they are looking past this temporary effect.\n\nThe bottom line: the Bank of Canada needs to carry on cutting as inflation gradually subsides. Otherwise, in real terms, i.e. after adjusting for inflation, its monetary policy will become gradually more restrictive even if it leaves the overnight rate where it is.

This marks the second consecutive rate cut and signals the possibility of further cuts if inflation continues to decrease.\n\nGovernor Tiff Macklem stated that the decision was influenced by economic data showing slack in the labor market, excess supply in the economy, and a continued drop in inflation. Since March 2022, inflation has fallen from a peak of 8.1% to 2.7% in June 2024.\n\nMacklem emphasized the bank's commitment to returning inflation to the 2% target, but he acknowledged that shelter costs and other price factors could delay this process.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWednesday's move was no surprise to economists and market watchers as the economy has been showing more signs of cooling. In June, inflation fell to 2.7 per cent, while unemployment rose to 6.4 per cent.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem emphasized that more cuts are in the cards so long as inflation continues to fall in line with the bank's forecast.\n\nThe timing of the cuts, however, will depend on the easing of shelter inflation -- mainly rent and mortgage interest costs -- and other services, he warned, including those that are closely affected by increasing wages, such as restaurants and personal care.\n\n\"We are not on a predetermined path,\" he said in a press conference, \"we will be taking our monetary policy decisions one at a time.\"\n\nThe central bank makes eight interest rate decisions a year. After Wednesday, there are three more in 2024, including in September, October and December.\n\n\"Even with today's move, a 4.5 per cent policy rate that's well north of inflation is still quite restrictive,\" and will continue to hamper spending and the housing market, said Rishi Sondhi, economist at TD Bank.\n\nIn other words, Wednesday's cut won't bring significant relief to Canadians just yet.\n\nThe job market is now weaker since the depths of the pandemic, with some economists arguing that certain pockets of the population, particularly youth and recent immigrants, are living under circumstances similar to a recession.\n\nThe housing market, too, has come to a halt as prospective buyers wait on the sidelines for more rate cuts.\n\nSenior deputy governor Carolyn Rogers referred to the housing crisis as a \"structural imbalance\" in Wednesday's press conference.\n\nShe acknowledged the policy interest rate's impact on shelter inflation through higher mortgage costs, but said that \"it would be a mistake to pin all of our hopes ... on interest rates,\" adding that \"Canadians need a more fulsome and more coordinated policy response than that.\"\n\nThe bank expects inflation to average 2.3 per cent this quarter and return \"sustainably\" to its two per cent target in the second half of 2025, according to its July monetary policy report.\n\n\"That provides some support to our view that a third consecutive cut in September is the most likely outcome,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nBrown believes that the central bank will continue to cut the key rate by 25 basis points at each meeting until it reaches 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe Bank of Canada raised rates 10 times from 0.5 per cent to five per cent between March 2022 and last summer in a bid to wrestle inflation down to its two per cent target.\n\nThe theory is that by making it more expensive to borrow money, consumers and businesses will spend less, driving down prices and slowing the economy.\n\nNow, as the economy slows and inflation has been moving downward, the bank is taking the reverse approach, trying to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.\n\n\"We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much,\" said Macklem.\n\nThe bank is forecasting stronger economic growth in the second half of 2024 driven by a boost in exports and consumer spending, according to its monetary policy report.\n\n\"The key point is that the bank is aware that GDP growth could be strong, and its communications today suggest that a much better quarter for GDP will not prevent further rate cuts,\" said Brown.\n\nWith files from Josh Rubin.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The full statement from the Bank of Canada:\n\nThe Bank of Canada today reduced its target for the overnight rate to 4\u00bd%, with the Bank Rate at 4\u00be% and the deposit rate at 4\u00bd%. The Bank is continuing its policy of balance sheet normalization.\n\nThe global economy is expected to continue expanding at an annual rate of about 3% through 2026. While inflation is still above central bank targets in most advanced economies, it is forecast to ease gradually. In the United States, the anticipated economic slowdown is materializing, with consumption growth moderating. US inflation looks to have resumed its downward path. In the euro area, growth is picking up following a weak 2023. China's economy is growing modestly, with weak domestic demand partially offset by strong exports. Global financial conditions have eased, with lower bond yields, buoyant equity prices, and robust corporate debt issuance. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable and oil prices are around the levels assumed in April's Monetary Policy Report (MPR).\n\nIn Canada, economic growth likely picked up to about 1\u00bd% through the first half of this year. However, with robust population growth of about 3%, the economy's potential output is still growing faster than GDP, which means excess supply has increased. Household spending, including both consumer purchases and housing, has been weak. There are signs of slack in the labour market. The unemployment rate has risen to 6.4%, with employment continuing to grow more slowly than the labour force and job seekers taking longer to find work. Wage growth is showing some signs of moderating, but remains elevated.\n\nGDP growth is forecast to increase in the second half of 2024 and through 2025. This reflects stronger exports and a recovery in household spending and business investment as borrowing costs ease. Residential investment is expected to grow robustly. With new government limits on admissions of non-permanent residents, population growth should slow in 2025.\n\nOverall, the Bank forecasts GDP growth of 1.2% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025, and 2.4% in 2026. The strengthening economy will gradually absorb excess supply through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nCPI inflation moderated to 2.7% in June after increasing in May. Broad inflationary pressures are easing. The Bank's preferred measures of core inflation have been below 3% for several months and the breadth of price increases across components of the CPI is now near its historical norm. Shelter price inflation remains high, driven by rent and mortgage interest costs, and is still the biggest contributor to total inflation. Inflation is also elevated in services that are closely affected by wages, such as restaurants and personal care.\n\nThe Bank's preferred measures of core inflation are expected to slow to about 2\u00bd% in the second half of 2024 and ease gradually through 2025. The Bank expects CPI inflation to come down below core inflation in the second half of this year, largely because of base year effects on gasoline prices. As those effects wear off, CPI inflation may edge up again before settling around the 2% target next year.\n\nWith broad price pressures continuing to ease and inflation expected to move closer to 2%, Governing Council decided to reduce the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points. Ongoing excess supply is lowering inflationary pressures. At the same time, price pressures in some important parts of the economy -- notably shelter and some other services -- are holding inflation up. Governing Council is carefully assessing these opposing forces on inflation. Monetary policy decisions will be guided by incoming information and our assessment of their implications for the inflation outlook. The Bank remains resolute in its commitment to restoring price stability for Canadians.", "source": {"uri": "forexlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ForexLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potential output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.forexlive.com/fl-static/fl-thumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

In the United States, the anticipated economic slowdown is materializing, with consumption growth moderating. US inflation looks to have resumed its downward path. In the euro area, growth is picking up following a weak 2023. China's economy is growing modestly, with weak domestic demand partially offset by strong exports. Global financial conditions have eased, with lower bond yields, buoyant equity prices, and robust corporate debt issuance. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable and oil prices are around the levels assumed in April's Monetary Policy Report (MPR).\n\nIn Canada, economic growth likely picked up to about 1\u00bd% through the first half of this year. However, with robust population growth of about 3%, the economy's potential output is still growing faster than GDP, which means excess supply has increased. Household spending, including both consumer purchases and housing, has been weak. There are signs of slack in the labour market. The unemployment rate has risen to 6.4%, with employment continuing to grow more slowly than the labour force and job seekers taking longer to find work. Wage growth is showing some signs of moderating, but remains elevated.\n\nGDP growth is forecast to increase in the second half of 2024 and through 2025. This reflects stronger exports and a recovery in household spending and business investment as borrowing costs ease. Residential investment is expected to grow robustly. With new government limits on admissions of non-permanent residents, population growth should slow in 2025.\n\nOverall, the Bank forecasts GDP growth of 1.2% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025, and 2.4% in 2026. The strengthening economy will gradually absorb excess supply through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nCPI inflation moderated to 2.7% in June after increasing in May. Broad inflationary pressures are easing. The Bank's preferred measures of core inflation have been below 3% for several months and the breadth of price increases across components of the CPI is now near its historical norm. Shelter price inflation remains high, driven by rent and mortgage interest costs, and is still the biggest contributor to total inflation. Inflation is also elevated in services that are closely affected by wages, such as restaurants and personal care.\n\nThe Bank's preferred measures of core inflation are expected to slow to about 2\u00bd% in the second half of 2024 and ease gradually through 2025. The Bank expects CPI inflation to come down below core inflation in the second half of this year, largely because of base year effects on gasoline prices. As those effects wear off, CPI inflation may edge up again before settling around the 2% target next year.\n\nWith broad price pressures continuing to ease and inflation expected to move closer to 2%, Governing Council decided to reduce the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points. Ongoing excess supply is lowering inflationary pressures. At the same time, price pressures in some important parts of the economy -- notably shelter and some other services -- are holding inflation up. Governing Council is carefully assessing these opposing forces on inflation. Monetary policy decisions will be guided by incoming information and our assessment of their implications for the inflation outlook. The Bank remains resolute in its commitment to restoring price stability for Canadians.\n\nThe next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is September 4, 2024. The Bank will publish its next full outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, in the MPR on October 23, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "actionforex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Action Forex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bank_of_canada@actionforex.com", "name": "Bank Of Canada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overnight rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potential output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/tag-images/boc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The central bank's quarter-percentage-point cut brings its policy rate down to 4.5 per cent. The Bank of Canada says the decision was motivated by continued progress on getting inflation down as well as weakening economic conditions. In his prepared statement, governor Tiff Macklem says as inflation edges closer to its two per cent target, the central bank is trying to avoid the risk of the economy and inflation weakening by more than expected. At the same time, he warns the path back to two per cent inflation likely won't be a straight line and the timing of future interest rate cuts will depend on inflation's progression.

The BOC reiterated that inflation should return sustainably to its 2 per cent target in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe central bank trimmed its 2024 economic growth forecast to a lacklustre 1.2 per cent from the 1.5 per cent it predicted in April, in part because households are setting aside more money to pay debts and have less to spend on discretionary items.\n\nThe Canadian dollar weakened further after the rate cut announcement, with the loonie trading down 0.06 per cent to 1.3794 against the US dollar, or 72.5 US cents.\n\nMoney markets see a 50 per cent chance that the BOC will cut rates again in its next monetary policy decision on Sept 4, and are factoring in just one more 25-basis-point cut this year.\n\n\"We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much,\" Macklem said.

But this data followed a surprise jump in May.\n\nEconomists expressed concerns about the prospect of weaker economic growth in the coming months, reiterating that a slowdown could trigger more rate cuts.\n\n\"The Bank of Canada does seem to move into some of the weaker facets of the economy,\" said Andrew Kelvin, head of Canadian and global rates strategy at TD Securities.\n\nHe expects another 50 basis points of rate cuts this year.\n\nDoug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the commentary on weaker growth by the governor and slack in the labour market was \"the signal that more rates are coming before too long.\"\n\nIn its quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) released on Wednesday, the central bank projected overall inflation would be 2.6 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 2025.\n\nAnnualised growth was just 1.7 per cent in the first quarter, way below the central bank's forecast of 2.8 per cent in April.\n\nThe central bank said growth would increase in the second half of 2024, led by stronger exports and a recovery in household spending as borrowing costs ease.\n\n\"With the economy strengthening, excess supply will be absorbed next year and into 2026,\" Macklem said.\n\nThe BOC said it expected growth to be 2.1 per cent in 2025, down from its forecast of 2.2 per cent in April. It expects growth of 2.6 per cent in 2026.

lowers key lending rate to 4.5%", "body": "Canada's central bank on Wednesday lowered its key lending rate to 4.5 percent, saying the second straight cut of 25 basis points was warranted due to slowing inflation.\n\nCanada had held its benchmark rate steady for almost a year at 5.0 percent, the highest level in two decades, before initiating a cut in early June.\n\nThat reduction to 4.75 percent made it the first among the Group of Seven leading economies to ease monetary policy in the current cycle.\n\n\"With broad price pressures continuing to ease and inflation expected to move closer to 2 percent, Governing Council decided to reduce the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points,\" the Bank of Canada said in a statement.\n\nAfter an unexpected upturn in May, Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to 2.7 percent year-on-year in June, the bank said, paving the way for Wednesday's rate cut.\n\nAlthough the modest cuts will not make borrowing significantly cheaper for Canadians, the end of the monetary policy tightening cycle is expected to breathe confidence into the economy.\n\nThe central bank however lowered its prediction for annual economic growth from 1.5 percent to 1.2 percent.\n\n\"As inflation gets closer to the 2% target, the risk that inflation comes in higher than expected has to be increasingly balanced against the risk that the economy and inflation could be weaker than expected,\" bank chief Tiff Macklem told reporters.\n\n\"If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate,\" Macklem said.\n\nClaire Fan, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada, said she expected \"two additional rate cuts this year -- one at each meeting after today's meeting that will lower the overnight rate to a still restrictive 4% by the end of 2024.\"\n\nThe Canadian central bank's next monetary policy meeting will take place on September 4.\n\nbur-amp/sst/bjt\n\nMore

returning to its historical norm and the bank's \"preferred measures of core inflation have been below 3% for several months.\"\n\nHowever, shelter price inflation remains high as rent and mortgage interest costs continue to rise, acting as the biggest contributor to total inflation.\n\nInflation increased in the service sector as a result of increased wages, affecting areas like personal care and restaurants.\n\n\"The Bank expects CPI inflation to come down below core inflation in the second half of this year, largely because of base year effects on gasoline prices,\" reads the release. \"As those effects wear off, CPI inflation may edge up again before settling around the 2% target next year.\"\n\nThe central bank said that ongoing excess supply is lowering inflationary pressures but that shelter and service costs continue to hold up inflation.\n\nThe Bank of Canada will announce its next overnight rate target in September and will publish its full outlook on the economy and inflation in October's Monetary Policy Report.", "source": {"uri": "tnc.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "tnc.news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quinn_patrick@tnc.news", "name": "Quinn Patrick", "type":

The bank is continuing its policy of balance sheet normalization.\n\nThe global economy is expected to continue expanding at an annual rate of about 3 percent through 2026. While inflation is still above central bank targets in most advanced economies, it is forecast to ease gradually.\n\nIn the United States, the anticipated economic slowdown is materializing, with consumption growth moderating. US inflation looks to have resumed its downward path. In the euro area, growth is picking up following a weak 2023.\n\nChina's economy is growing modestly, with weak domestic demand partially offset by strong exports. Global financial conditions have eased, with lower bond yields, buoyant equity prices, and robust corporate debt issuance. The Canadian dollar has been relatively stable and oil prices are around the levels assumed in April's Monetary Policy Report (MPR).\n\nIn Canada, economic growth likely picked up to about 1\u00bd percent through the first half of this year. However, with robust population growth of about 3 percent, the economy's potential output is still growing faster than GDP, which means excess supply has increased. Household spending, including both consumer purchases and housing, has been weak. There are signs of slack in the labour market. The unemployment rate has risen to 6.4 percent, with employment continuing to grow more slowly than the labour force and job seekers taking longer to find work. Wage growth is showing some signs of moderating, but remains elevated.\n\nGDP growth is forecast to increase in the second half of 2024 and through 2025. This reflects stronger exports and a recovery in household spending and business investment as borrowing costs ease. Residential investment is expected to grow robustly. With new government limits on admissions of non-permanent residents, population growth should slow in 2025.\n\nOverall, the bank forecasts GDP growth of 1.2 percent in 2024, 2.1 percent in 2025, and 2.4 percent in 2026. The strengthening economy will gradually absorb excess supply through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nCPI inflation moderated to 2.7 percent in June after increasing in May. Broad inflationary pressures are easing. The bank's preferred measures of core inflation have been below 3 percent for several months and the breadth of price increases across components of the CPI is now near its historical norm. Shelter price inflation remains high, driven by rent and mortgage interest costs, and is still the biggest contributor to total inflation. Inflation is also elevated in services that are closely affected by wages, such as restaurants and personal care.\n\nThe bank's preferred measures of core inflation are expected to slow to about 2\u00bd percent in the second half of 2024 and ease gradually through 2025. The bank expects CPI inflation to come down below core inflation in the second half of this year, largely because of base year effects on gasoline prices. As those effects wear off, CPI inflation may edge up again before settling around the 2 percent target next year.\n\nWith broad price pressures continuing to ease and inflation expected to move closer to 2 percent, governing council decided to reduce the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points. Ongoing excess supply is lowering inflationary pressures. At the same time, price pressures in some important parts of the economy - notably shelter and some other services - are holding inflation up.\n\nGoverning council is carefully assessing these opposing forces on inflation. Monetary policy decisions will be guided by incoming information and our assessment of their implications for the inflation outlook. The bank remains resolute in its commitment to restoring price stability for Canadians.", "source": {"uri": "caribbeannewsglobal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Caribbean News Global"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Potential output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://caribbeannewsglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/boc_july24-report.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Changes to headline inflation forecasts should not be interpreted as signposts for potential policy changes.\"\n\nDBS economist Chua Han Teng said the softer core inflation number in June reinforces expectations that the underlying core disinflation or reduction in the rate of inflation trend remains intact.\n\nHe added that core inflation on a three month-on-three month percentage change on a seasonally adjusted annualised basis trended lower in June from its February peak.\n\nOCBC's chief economist Selena Ling said in light of the more rapid than expected dip in headline inflation in June, the bank's full-year headline inflation forecast has been lowered to 2.6 per cent from the previous 2.8 per cent, while core inflation for the year is projected to come in at 2.9 per cent from the previous estimate of 3 per cent.\n\nThe June data showed that private transport costs recorded the steepest year-on-year drop of 0.7 per cent, from a 2.8 per cent rise in May. The fall was led by lower prices of cars and motorcycles, as well as a slower rise in petrol prices.\n\nInflation for retail and other goods came in at 0.5 per cent in June, down from 1.5 per cent in May, due to smaller increases in the prices of medicine, health products and personal effects. The prices of clothing and footwear fell more steeply.\n\nServices inflation rose 3.4 per cent in June, easing from 3.6 per cent in May, on the back of a slower pace of increase in the cost of hospital services and holiday expenses.\n\nInflation for food remained unchanged at 2.8 per cent, while that of gas and electricity also stayed the same at 6.9 per cent.\n\nAccommodation inflation in June was a touch lower, at 3.3 per cent, as housing rents rose at a more modest pace. - The Straits Times/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Trade_and_Industry_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Trade and Industry (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Authority_of_Singapore", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Authority of Singapore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBS_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DBS Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Han Chinese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2024/07/23/2818218.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 1166, "textEnd": 1173}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1413, "textEnd": 1420, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The bank reiterated that inflation should return sustainably to its 2 percent target in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe Bank trimmed its 2024 growth forecast to a lacklustre 1.2 percent from the 1.5 percent it predicted in April, in part because households are setting aside more money to pay debts and have less to spend on discretionary items.\n\nThe Canadian dollar weakened further after the rate cut announcement, with the loonie trading down 0.06 percent to 1.3794 against the US dollar, or 72.5 US cents.\n\nMoney markets are seeing a 52 percent chance of a cut in the Bank's next monetary policy decision announcement on September 4, and factoring in just one more 25 basis point cut this year, which would bring the policy rate down to 4.25 percent.\n\n\"We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much,\" said Macklem. The downside risks to inflation were taking on increased weight in monetary policy deliberations, he said.\n\nInflation is facing two opposing forces - a weak economy pulling it down and persistently high prices of shelter and services keeping it up.\n\n\"The risk that inflation comes in higher than expected has to be increasingly balanced against the risk that the economy and inflation could be weaker than expected,\" said Macklem.\n\nConsumer prices in June slackened to 2.7 percent with the bank's closely tracked core measures of inflation also easing marginally. But this data followed a surprise jump in May.\n\nIn its quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) released on Wednesday, the bank projected overall inflation would be 2.6 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year.\n\nFirst quarter annualised growth was just 1.7 percent, way below the bank's April forecast of 2.8 percent.\n\nThe Bank said growth would increase in the second half, led by stronger exports and a recovery in household spending as borrowing costs ease.\n\n\"With the economy strengthening, excess supply will be absorbed next year and into 2026,\" Macklem said.\n\nThe Bank said it expected growth to be 2.1 percent in 2025, revised from 2.2 percent in April, and 2.6 percent in 2026.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loonie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loonie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2021-10-07T174033Z_427158869_RC255Q98AC22_RTRMADP_3_CANADA-CENBANK-1717598197.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1288}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Core inflation fell to 2.9%. The full-year inflation forecast remains at 2.5-3.5%. This marks a 16.5% rise in inflation from June 2020 to June 2024, partly due to GST hikes.\n\nSingapore's headline and core inflation rates have slowed more than expected in June, marking the lowest level in three years, according to data released by the Department of Statistics on Tuesday (23 July).\n\nThe headline inflation rate in June was recorded at 2.4 per cent, down significantly from 3.1 per cent in May and below the median forecast of 2.7 per cent by private-sector economists polled by Bloomberg. This is the lowest rate since August 2021, when it also stood at 2.4 per cent. The decline is attributed primarily to a reduction in private transport costs and a decrease in core inflation.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes accommodation and private transport, was 2.9 per cent in June, a slight decrease from 3.1 per cent in May and lower than the median estimate of 3 per cent by economists.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the overall consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.2 per cent in June, while the core CPI remained unchanged.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced in a separate release that the official full-year forecast range for headline inflation is under review and will be updated in MAS's next monetary policy statement, expected by 31 July.\n\nFor now, both MAS and MTI have maintained their full-year inflation forecasts, predicting that both headline and core inflation will average between 2.5 and 3.5 per cent. Excluding the transitory effects of the goods and services tax (GST) hike, both headline and core inflation are expected to be between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent.\n\nIn June, most broad CPI categories experienced lower inflation or remained flat. Private transport costs fell by 0.7 per cent due to declining prices of cars and motorcycles, along with a slower rise in petrol prices.\n\nAmong core inflation components, retail and other goods saw the most significant easing, dropping to 0.5 per cent from 1.5 per cent previously. Services inflation also moderated to 3.4 per cent from 3.6 per cent, primarily due to a slower increase in hospital services and holiday expenses costs. Food costs remained unchanged at 2.8 per cent, indicating stable food services inflation. Electricity and gas inflation stayed flat at 6.9 per cent, with both electricity and gas prices rising at a steady pace.\n\nDespite the recent dip in June, inflation has increased by 16.5 per cent from June 2020 (CPI 99.818) to June 2024 (CPI 116.3).

A recent easing of inflationary pressures and the central bank's inflation forecast prompted the decision.\n\nThe central bank said \"CPI inflation moderated to 2.7% in June after increasing in May. Broad inflationary pressures are easing. The Bank's preferred measures of core inflation have been below 3% for several months and the breadth of price increases across components of the CPI is now near its historical norm.\"\n\n\"With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations,\" BOC Governor Tiff Macklem said in prepared remarks.\n\nMacklem reiterated that it's \"reasonable\" to expect further interest rate cuts, and that the bank will be taking its decisions \"one at a time,\" pushing back on expectations that the bank is on a predetermined cutting path.\n\nThe Bank's preferred measures of core inflation are expected to slow to about 2\u00bd% in the second half of 2024 and ease gradually through 2025. The Bank expects CPI inflation to come down below core inflation in the second half of this year, largely because of base year effects on gasoline prices. As those effects wear off, CPI inflation may edge up again before settling around the 2% target next year.\"\n\nBOC officials say they've continued to make progress on bringing price pressures to heel, and that a return to the 2% inflation target is \"in sight.\" The June consumer price index, which showed inflation decelerated to a 2.7% yearly pace, also pointed to slowing underlying price pressures, the bank said.\n\nOverall, Bloomberg summarizes, officials seems more convinced that price pressures are under control, and are increasingly focused on preserving a soft landing for the economy. The dovish suite of communications suggest that governing council has shifted their attention to ensuring inflation does not substantially undershoot the 2% target.\n\nThe bank said wage growth, while elevated, is moderating as the labor market loosens. Corporate pricing behavior has \"largely normalized\", and inflation expectations have come down. In June, the final paragraph of the bank's policy statement had focused on those concerns, but the July statement was largely rewritten to focus on \"ongoing excess supply\" and \"opposing forces\" on inflation -- the bank sees shelter and services holding up progress.\n\nThere was no mention of the recent reacceleration of the 3-month moving average of the bank's preferred core measures, which accelerated to 2.91% in June. Instead, policymakers highlighted progress on the yearly change of median and trim CPI -- which is expected to decelerate to 2.5%, according to newly added projections.\n\nIt's a marked shift in the bank's attitude toward inflation. A summary of deliberations from the officials' June meeting showed policymakers had debated whether more disinflation proof was needed before easing. Now they're more convinced they have enough evidence. The balance of risks is changing too. Officials listed weaker-than-expected household spending as a main downside risk, pointing to upcoming mortgage renewals as a risk to consumption growth. In its statement, the bank said it's seeing more \"signs of slack\" in the labor market, and said job-seekers are taking longer to find work.\n\nAs noted above, last month the Bank of Canada became the first Group of Seven central bank to cut interest rates. Since then, the ECB has also started easing, with the Fed expected to join the party, potentially as soon as July.\n\nUSDCAD rose 0.1% after the decision, rising to 1.38, the highest level in 3 months, while Canada's 2y yield fell about 2bp.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-07/BOC%20rate.jpg?h=2ece01b0&itok=s9Grb5n6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The bank reiterated that inflation should return sustainably to its 2% target in the second half of 2025.\n\nThe bank trimmed its 2024 growth forecast to a lackluster 1.2% from the 1.5% it predicted in April, in part because households are setting aside more money to pay debts and have less to spend on discretionary items.\n\nThe Canadian dollar weakened further after the rate cut announcement, with the loonie trading down 0.06% to 1.3794 against the U.S. dollar, or 72.5 U.S. cents.\n\nMoney markets are seeing a 52% chance of a cut in the BoC's next monetary policy decision announcement on Sept. 4, and factoring in just one more 25 basis point cut this year, which would bring the policy rate down to 4.25%.\n\n\"We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much,\" said Macklem. The downside risks to inflation were taking on increased weight in monetary policy deliberations, he said.\n\nInflation is facing two opposing forces - a weak economy pulling it down and persistently high prices of shelter and services keeping it up.\n\n\"The risk that inflation comes in higher that expected has to be increasingly balanced against the risk that the economy and inflation could be weaker than expected,\" said Macklem.\n\nConsumer prices in June slackened to 2.7% with the bank's closely tracked core measures of inflation also easing marginally. But this data followed a surprise jump in May.\n\nIn its quarterly Monetary Policy Report (MPR) released on Wednesday, the bank projected overall inflation would be 2.6% this year and 2.4% next year.\n\nFirst quarter annualized growth was just 1.7%, way below the bank's April forecast of 2.8%.\n\nThe bank said growth would increase in the second half, led by stronger exports and a recovery in household spending as borrowing costs ease.\n\n\"With the economy strengthening, excess supply will be absorbed next year and into 2026,\" Macklem said.\n\nThe bank said it expected growth to be 2.1% in 2025, revised from 2.2% in April, and 2.6% in 2026.

slowing inflation.\n\nCanada had held its benchmark rate steady for almost a year at 5.0 percent, the highest level in two decades, before initiating a cut in early June.\n\nThat reduction to 4.75 percent made it the first among the Group of Seven leading economies to ease monetary policy in the current cycle.\n\n\"With broad price pressures continuing to ease and inflation expected to move closer to 2 percent, Governing Council decided to reduce the policy interest rate by a further 25 basis points,\" the Bank of Canada said in a statement.\n\nAfter an unexpected upturn in May, Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to 2.7 percent year-on-year in June, the bank said, paving the way for Wednesday's rate cut.\n\nAlthough the modest cuts will not make borrowing significantly cheaper for Canadians, the end of the monetary policy tightening cycle is expected to breathe confidence into the economy.\n\nMore from this section US female fighter pilot scores historical first CDC Warns of

to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate,\" Macklem said.\n\nClaire Fan, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Canada, said she expected \"two additional rate cuts this year -- one at each meeting

Its most recent forecasts are badly out of date, as they did not take account of budget measures on electricity, transport and rent subsidies plus the fact the economy is weaker than it was assuming.\n\nTaking account of those issues will see the revised RBA inflation forecasts materially lower, more in line with the market forecasts and at levels consistent with the target.\n\nThe 'inflation back in target range' story will be confirmed in the months ahead with the monthly inflation data and then, ultimately, with the September quarter data released on October 30.\n\nIn addition to being a critical factor in the resolution of the recent cost-of-living crisis, low inflation means that the RBA can look to start an interest rate-cutting cycle, the timing and magnitude of which is currently open to debate.\n\nThe so-called 'double-whammy' of lower inflation and the accompanying interest rate cuts will further improve the financial position of mortgage holders and small and medium businesses with loans and overdrafts. These parts of the economy have been severely impacted by the 425 basis points of interest rate hikes from the RBA in the current monetary policy cycle.\n\nLow inflation is good news for many reasons - an easing in cost-of-living pressures and it sets the scene for lower interest rates.\n\nTo be sure, the inflation data next week are important.\n\nBut it is the inflation momentum beyond that that is now in the middle of the RBA's radar and, as such, will spark a serious and well-founded discussion on the start of an interest rate-cutting cycle.", "source": {"uri": "au.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo7 Finance"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_koukoulas@au.finance.yahoo.com", "name": "Stephen Koukoulas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westpac", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westpac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richter magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pEqWnHRxnINOCFmjk5YcJA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/dd72c030-4885-11ef-affa-25d9ae645bb0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 381, "textEnd": 388}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1801, "textEnd": 1809}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 2367, "textEnd": 2377}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

However, it warned that inflation is expected to rise temporarily in July due to adjustments in administered prices, taxes, and supply-side factors in unprocessed food prices.\n\nThe bank emphasized that while the rise in underlying inflation is expected to be relatively limited, inflationary pressures remain significant. \"The committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged but reiterated its high attention to inflation risks,\" it stated.\n\nThe bank pledged to maintain a tight monetary stance until a significant and sustained decline in the underlying trend of monthly inflation is observed, and inflation expectations converge to the projected forecast range.\n\nTurkey has been grappling with soaring inflation, which reached an annual rate of 71.6% in June. This is a slight improvement from May's 75.45%, marking the first decline in eight months. However, critics cast doubt on this calculation, with some alleging that the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) manipulated the inflation rate to allow the government to keep raises for public employee salaries and pensions lower. TurkStat has long been criticized for allegedly manipulating data, especially for inflation and unemployment.\n\nThe government and the Central Bank have been under pressure to address the cost of living crisis, with critics arguing that earlier low interest rate policies contributed to the economic instability.\n\nSince last year, following the re-election of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and the forming of his new cabinet, the Central Bank has aggressively raised interest rates from 8.5% to 50% as part of a shift towards more orthodox economic policies. This move came after a period of keeping rates low despite rising inflation, which drew criticism from economic experts and opposition parties.\n\nEconomists and analysts remain cautious about the future. A Reuters poll indicated that no significant rate cuts are expected until the next quarter, with a gradual reduction anticipated by the end of 2024.

Similarly, more hawkish members can also justifiably argue that rates need to be left on hold for just a little bit longer.\n\nSo what will factor in the decision for rate-setters?\n\nInflation\n\nThe headline rate of inflation fell to the two per cent target in May for the first time since July 2021, having peaked at over 11 per cent in the autumn of 2022.\n\nThe relatively rapid progress on inflation was enabled by falling energy prices and much lower food inflation as global energy markets normalised in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe Bank of England expects the headline rate of inflation to pick up slightly before the end of the year, but it won't come anywhere near the peaks of last year. With inflation likely to remain at or near the target, markets expect an interest rate cut in the near future.\n\nServices inflation\n\nAlthough inflation has come back down to target, services inflation remains worryingly persistent and does not yet show signs of normalising. The latest figures showed it remained stuck at 5.7 per cent in June.\n\nRate-setters view services inflation as a good gauge of domestic inflationary pressures because it includes many of the sectors which are most important for domestic consumers, such as spending on recreation and holidays.\n\nBack in May, the Bank of England forecast that services inflation would have fallen to 5.3 per cent, meaning it is running comfortably ahead of rate-setters' expectations. This is a cause for concern.\n\nWage growth\n\nAnother headache for the Bank is stubborn wage growth. Like services inflation, the latest figures put annual pay growth at 5.7 per cent.\n\nWhile this is down from nearer eight per cent last summer, it is still nearly double the level consistent with inflation remaining sustainably at two per cent.\n\nStrong wage growth is likely to contribute to sticky price pressures in the services sector and so MPC members might be wary of cutting rates while pay pressures remain so strong.\n\nGDP\n\nThe economy has comfortably outperformed expectations this year, growing at 0.7 per cent in the first quarter. A number of economists have bumped up their forecasts for the remainder of the year on the back of this strong performance.\n\nHowever, stronger than expected growth may tilt the balance towards a hold in August as the economy appears to be growing at or near its potential output. This could put some upward pressure on prices.\n\nThere is also less urgency to cut interest rates when the economy is growing at its fastest pace in nearly two years.\n\nUnemployment\n\nUnemployment has increased for four consecutive months, rising from 3.8 per cent at the end of 2023 to 4.4 per cent, meaning an extra 190,000 people are out of a job.\n\nSooner or later, rising unemployment should filter through into weaker wage growth, because there's more competition for jobs. There's some indications that this might be happening.\n\nA Bank of England survey also showed that firms expect wage growth to slow in the year ahead. Expected wage growth edged lower to 4.0 per cent, down from 4.1 per cent and the lowest level since the question was asked back in May 2022.\n\nServices producer prices\n\nForward looking indicators also suggest that services inflation could fall in the months ahead. An ONS survey of how much firms in the service sector are passing on higher costs fell from 3.7 per cent in the first quarter to 3.1 per cent in the second, suggesting firms are absorbing higher costs.\n\n\"If the usual correlation holds then you would expect CPI services to come down in the coming months as well,\" Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS said.\n\nSo while services inflation and wage growth are both running too hot for comfort, there's good reason to think they will fall soon.

Officials see below-potential growth continuing to cool inflation, and said they're spending more time discussing economic headwinds.\n\n\"With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations,\" Macklem said in prepared remarks.\n\nMacklem reiterated that it's \"reasonable\" to expect further interest rate cuts, and that the bank will be taking its decisions \"one at a time,\" pushing back on expectations that the bank is on a predetermined cutting path.\n\nOfficials say they've continued to make progress on bringing price pressures to heel, and that a return to the two per cent inflation target is \"in sight.\" The June consumer price index, which showed inflation decelerated to a 2.7 per cent yearly pace, also pointed to slowing underlying price pressures, the bank said.\n\nOverall, officials seems more convinced that price pressures are under control, and are increasingly focused on preserving a soft landing for the economy. The dovish suite of communications suggest that governing council has shifted their attention to ensuring inflation does not substantially undershoot the two per cent target.\n\nIt's a marked shift in the bank's attitude toward inflation. A summary of deliberations from the officials' June meeting showed policymakers had debated whether more disinflation proof was needed before easing. Now they're more convinced they have enough evidence.\n\nThe balance of risks is changing too. Officials listed weaker-than-expected household spending as a main downside risk, pointing to upcoming mortgage renewals as a risk to consumption growth. In its statement, the bank said it's seeing more \"signs of slack\" in the labour market, and said job-seekers are taking longer to find work.\n\nIn June, the Bank of Canada became the first Group of Seven central bank to cut interest rates. Since then, the European Central Bank has also started easing. Importantly, markets and economists are increasingly convinced the U.S. Federal Reserve will also start cutting.\n\nIn the accompanying monetary policy report, the bank kept its economic forecasts roughly the same -- growth is expected to remain in excess supply over the forecast horizon. Inflation is expected to rise 2.6 per cent this year, steadily decelerating to reach two per cent by the end of 2025.\n\nA sharp rise in housing prices is no longer listed as a main upside risk, and officials cut the contribution of housing to the economy in 2024.\n\nIn the accompanying sees growth reaccelerating to a 2.8 per cent annualized pace in the third quarter, driven partly by higher exports from the expanded Trans Mountain pipeline. The economy is expect to expand 1.2 per cent in 2024, revised down from 1.5 per cent previously.\n\nThe bank said wage growth, while elevated, is moderating as the labour market loosens. Corporate pricing behavior has \"largely normalized\", and inflation expectations have come down.\n\nIn June, the final paragraph of the bank's policy statement had focused on those concerns, but the July statement was largely rewritten to focus on \"ongoing excess supply\" and \"opposing forces\" on inflation -- the bank sees shelter and services holding up progress.\n\nThere was no mention of the recent reacceleration of the 3-month moving average of the bank's preferred core measures, which accelerated to 2.91 per cent in June. Instead, policymakers highlighted progress on the yearly change of median and trim CPI -- which is expected to decelerate to 2.5 per cent, according to newly added projections.\n\nMoving more swiftly would allow policymakers to get ahead of coming mortgage renewals, reducing the payment shock for homebuyers who signed on at rock-bottom rates during the pandemic. But cutting too fast has the potential to reignite cost pressures or the country's supply-squeezed housing market.\n\nMacklem and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers will take questions from reporters at 10:30 a.m. Ottawa time.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overnight rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_forecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic forecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/resizer/v2/TGVXXS7BSJLD42EXNHY3JH5SBI.jpg?smart=true&auth=6b42c8633a55496779b973ef046ca7f7407927ba4705e695896f56ccc8101948&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Under the framework that was first introduced in 2016, RBI targets headline inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI).\n\n\"Higher food prices are, more often, not demand-induced but supply-induced,\" the survey said. \"Short-run monetary policy tools are meant to counteract price pressures arising out of excess aggregate demand growth.\"\n\nFood inflation has remained a concern for the RBI and governor Shaktikanta Das said on 7 June that the monetary policy committee \"remains vigilant to any upside risks to inflation, particularly from food inflation, which could possibly derail the path of disinflation.\"\n\nThe concern is borne out by data. In June, headline inflation was at 5.1%, but food inflation was at 9.4%. However, core inflation - headline inflation stripped off food and fuel -- stood at 3.1% in the same period.\n\nAccording to the survey, food makes up a very high portion of the consumer price index in developing countries and when central banks in developing countries target headline inflation, they effectively target food prices.\n\nFood is currently assigned a 46% weightage in the headline CPI basket.\n\n\"So, when food prices rise, inflation targets come under threat. Therefore, the central bank appeals to the government to bring down the increase in the prices of food products,\" the survey said.\n\n\"...The central bank is unlikely to see merit in this. Sustained rise in food inflation tends to influence inflationary expectations, which has kept policymakers cautious for (a) good part of this year and FY24,\" said Radhika Rao, executive director and senior economist, DBS Bank", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shayan_ghosh@livemint.com", "name": "Shayan Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaktikanta_Das", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaktikanta Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aggregate demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/07/22/600x338/veg-kTXD--621x414LiveMint_1721659691455_1721659691637.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 883, "textEnd": 889}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

However, he warned that the risks to the inflation outlook remained including geopolitical tensions, and rising house prices.\n\n\"If we lower our policy interest rate too quickly, we could jeopardize the progress we've made,\" Macklem said at the time. \"Further progress in bringing down inflation is likely uneven and risks remain.\"\n\nSince that decision, inflation has come down to 2.7 per cent after it increased to 2.9 per cent in May. The economy is also showing signs of slowdown with job creation slower today than it was six months ago, unemployment is ticking up and economists say there are signs of overall consumer stress, including deteriorating credit quality.\n\nGuatieri says that since the meeting in June, everything has moved in the direction of warranting another rate cut.\n\n\"The key core measures of inflation are tucked under 3 per cent, and most importantly for the Bank of Canada, there is every reason to believe inflation will just keep on falling,\" he said.\n\nThe Bank of Canada was the first central bank to cut rates ahead of its peers at the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the United States Federal Reserve. The vice-president at the Conference Board of Canada, Michael Burt, says that how quickly rates come down from here on out will depend, at least in part, on what those banks do.\n\n\"If the fed in the United States is not cutting rates, it's really going to slow down how quickly the Bank of Canada is cutting rates because they don't want to have too much divergence from what is happening in the United States and the rest of the world,\" Burt said.\n\nThe Bank of Canada makes eight interest rate decisions every year and many economists predict at least one or two more cuts will be announced by year's end. The next rate decision is scheduled for September 4.\n\n\"We are looking at measured declines rather than bigger drops because it would signal that there is a lot more concerns if they went for a larger increase,\" Burt said. \"There is still a long way to go as we think neutral would be about 2.75 per cent, so you are still looking at 200 basis points for interest rates to fall over the next 12-18 months.\"\n\nAn MNP Consumer Debt Index survey conducted and released by Ipsos Monday found that two-thirds of respondents said they desperately needed interest rates to go down, with more than half saying they are concerned rates may not fall fast enough to help them out financially.\n\nIf the central bank cuts rates tomorrow as expected, the cost of borrowing will get cheaper and individuals with variable or adjustable rate mortgages will feel the impact almost immediately.\n\n\"It's good news across the board for borrowers but the impact will be slow and steady on the way down,\" said Ratehub.ca's mortgage expert Penelope Graham.\n\nGraham says she will be looking closely at what kind of long-term outlook Macklem provides and what insight or language he uses to describe how soon the central bank intends to cut rates again. The language there, she says, could impact the bond market and ultimately fixed rate mortgages.\n\n\"If the bank seems very dovish, if they are giving us more hints to when we could potentially see more cuts, the frequency, how many more, that could get the bond market moving a little lower,\" she said. \"That could set the stage for lower fixed rate mortgages.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overnight rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adjustable-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/7/23/bank-of-canada-1-6974807-1721770778535.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 2798, "textEnd": 2809}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 392, "textEnd": 399}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem speaks during a news conference on the Bank of Canada's rate announcement, in Ottawa, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin TangOTTAWA - The Bank of Canada is set to announce its interest rate decision this morning as economists widely expect a rate cut. Forecasters say slowing inflation and a weak economy justify a second consecutive cut by the central bank. After a historic run-up, the central bank lowered its policy rate for the first time in June, bringing it down from five per cent to 4.75 per cent. Governor Tiff Macklem signalled at the time that if inflation continues to ease, it would be reasonable to expect more rate cuts. Last week, Statistics Canada reported the annual inflation rate ticked back down to 2.7 per cent in June after flaring up again in May. Weak economic conditions have also slowed activity in the job market, bringing the unemployment rate up to 6.4 per cent last month.

Informally adopted in January 2014 and officially in 2016, the framework has been the subject of considerable debate over the last few years.\n\nThere really are two branches to India's inflation targeting debate: the numerical target -- 4% in a band of 2-6%, and the measure of inflation itself, which is headline inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI). The Economic Survey for 2023-24 has waded into this discussion, calling for a re-examination of the framework to see whether the target can be spelt out in terms of inflation excluding food.\n\nThe Survey makes a fairly compelling argument: food prices can't really be countered by tools at the disposal of the monetary policy authority. Instead, it is the government that acts and helps cool these prices, which in turn \"prevents farmers from benefiting from the rise in terms of trade in their favour\".\n\nThe Survey instead suggests that RBI focus on controlling inflation excluding food, leaving the government to take care of the hit to the pockets of the poor and low-income households from rising food prices through direct benefit transfers or even food coupons.\n\nGiven a choice, RBI would probably jump at the opportunity to not have to worry about food prices. Consider the last 10 months, which have seen CPI inflation average 5.1% and stay firmly within RBI's target band of 2-6%.\n\nAt the same time, Consumer Food Price Inflation has averaged 8.4%, with the June print at a six-month high of 9.36%. No wonder RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) is focused on food prices and has left interest rates unchanged for eight meetings in a row.\n\nThere is, however, a problem in targeting non-food inflation. Had RBI been targeting this narrower measure of inflation, as suggested by the Economic Survey, its monetary policy actions would have looked very different from what we have seen.\n\nAs per the law, the central bank is deemed to have failed when average CPI inflation is outside the 2-6% band for three quarters in a row. This occurred in 2022, when headline retail inflation averaged 6.3% in the January-March period, 7.3% in April-June, and 7.0% in July-September.\n\nOnce it started becoming clear that RBI was likely going to fail in its mandate, the MPC tightened the screws and began raising the policy repo rate starting in May 2022. The repo rate ended 2022-23 at 6.50%, 250 basis points higher than the pandemic-low of 4.00%.\n\nIf RBI was targeting non-food inflation, the central bank would have failed to meet its mandate in 2021 itself, with CPI inflation excluding food averaging 6.6% in April-June 2021, 6.7% in July-September, and 6.8% in October-December.\n\nThe central bank would have been forced to start its rate hike cycle a year earlier than it actually did, and economic growth may not have been as strong as it is now. Low food inflation of 3.1% in 2021, down from 9.6% in 2020, helped drag down the headline rate to a level that allowed India's rate-setters to support growth amid the raging covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTo be sure, this is a hypothetical exercise. Further, headline inflation may not necessarily be the best target, with Ashima Goyal, one of the three external members on the MPC, having talked up the usefulness of core inflation -- or inflation excluding food and fuel -- as a policy anchor. However, even Goyal thinks \"equity and consumer welfare considerations support targeting headline CPI\".\n\nNonetheless, the intervention by the Economic Survey comes at a rather opportune time. The current inflation target of 4% in a band of 2-6% is valid until March 2026. Coincidentally, it is expected that the ministry of statistics and programme implementation will release the new CPI inflation series, based on the latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, in early 2026.\n\nThe new inflation series should result in the weight of the 'food and beverages' group of the CPI reducing significantly from 45.86% at present; the same should hold true for the Consumer Food Price Index, which accounts for 39.06% of the CPI currently. This in itself should weaken the influence food prices exert over the headline inflation rate, making RBI's job that much easier.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Repurchase agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/07/22/600x338/food_prices_1721662801766_1721662801919.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-01-", "textStart": 192, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

longer.\n\nThe RBA has been fighting to get price rises back into its 2 to 3 per cent band since a stimulus-fuelled explosion in 2021 started to shred wages as the cost of living soared.\n\nBut Deutsche Bank has warned households are starting to lose trust that the target will be achieved any time soon.\n\nOnly 15 per cent of respondents to a regular Melbourne Institute survey believe inflation will hit the band in the year ahead -- though the numbers have been slowly improving since the post-COVID price spike.\n\n\"(Trust) in the RBA's inflation target has never been this low for this long,\" the report, authored by Deutsche Bank economist Phil Odonaghoe, said.\n\n\"Not only that, the longest prior stretch was about half as long as the current episode.\"\n\nThe RBA reckons inflation will be back under 3 per cent at the end of 2025.\n\nThe target has been crucial to keeping inflation low since its introduction in the early 1990s.\n\nWhen workers and businesses start to expect higher inflation, they ask for higher prices in wage deals and contracts -- pushing up costs and potentially sparking a vicious cycle.\n\nThe news will be a worry for the central bank, which has consistently warned that higher expected inflation will mean interest rates need to go up and stay up to slow rising prices.\n\nDeutsche Bank already believes the RBA will lift the nation's benchmark borrowing rate by 25 points in August as inflation runs above market forecasts.\n\nThe latest data on expected inflation would \"only add to the case for tighter policy\", the bank said.\n\n\"(The) Bank has repeatedly made clear it is alert to the risk that inflation expectations could decouple from the inflation target,\" the report said.\n\nBut late on Monday, markets were 75

This spike was largely fuelled by surge in food inflation at 9.4 per cent on the back of sharp rise in prices of vegetables.\n\nUnder the inflation targeting framework currently adopted in India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) targets CPI-based inflation.\n\nThe central bank is mandated to keep retail inflation at 4 per cent with a tolerance band of 2 percentage points on either side. Food accounts for nearly 50 percentage weightage in the CPI, leaving the central bank often in a fix as food inflation continues to remain volatile. Food inflation has remained above 8 per cent on a sustained basis in the recent months.\n\nNoting that higher food prices are, more often, not demand-induced but supply-induced, the Survey pointed out that short-run monetary policy tools are meant to counteract price pressures arising out of excess aggregate demand growth.\n\n\"Deploying them (short-run monetary tools) to deal with inflation caused by supply constraints may be counterproductive. Therefore, it is worth exploring whether India's inflation targeting framework should target the inflation rate excluding food,\" the Survey noted.\n\nThe Survey said that hardships caused by higher food prices for poor and low-income consumers can be handled through direct benefit transfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durations, it added.\n\nThe Economic Survey noted that food constitutes a very high portion of the CPI in developing countries. That is par for the course, it added. Hence, when central banks in developing countries target headline inflation, they effectively target food prices. So, when food prices rise, inflation targets come under threat. \"Therefore, the central bank appeals to the government to bring down the increase in the prices of food products. That prevents farmers from benefiting from the rise in terms of trade in their favour,\" the Survey added.\n\nCommenting on the Survey suggestion on re-think on Inflation targeting framework sans food items, Radhika Rao, Executive Director and Senior Economist, DBS Bank, said that the RBI is unlikely to see merit in any inflation targeting framework excluding food. Sustained rise in food inflation tends to influence inflationary expectations, which has kept policymakers cautious for a good part of this year and 2023-24, she added.\n\nCPI base year change\n\nMeanwhile, the Statistics Ministry has begun working towards the updation of base year of CPI to 2024 from 2012, the Survey has indicated.\n\n\"The ongoing efforts to construct the producer price index for goods and services may be expedited to have a greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation,\" the Survey said.\n\nFurther, considering that the results of the household consumer expenditure survey, 2022-23 of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation are available, it may be appropriate to expeditiously revise the CPI with fresh weights and item baskets, it added.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on July 22, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aggregate demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost-push_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost-push inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Producer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terms of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBS_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DBS Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/3lttvb/article68433516.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/INFLATION%20STANDALONE_16_07_6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The overall inflation rate continues to slowly revert to the midpoint of the inflation target band of 3%-6%.\"\n\nVan der Linde points out that South Africa's inflation rate averaged 5.3% in the first half of 2024 and they forecast overall inflation to trend lower in the second half, averaging around 4.4%. \"Overall, headline inflation should average lower at 4.9% this year compared to 5.9% in 2023.\"\n\nALSO READ: Food inflation lowest in 45 months\n\nHe says domestic inflation expectations have improved recently, while core inflation should remain steady near the midpoint of the Sarb's target band over the coming months. \"After the Sarb's split decision to keep rates unchanged at 8.25% during the July meeting, we believe interest rate cuts will happen in at least one of the final two meetings of 2024.\n\n\"Regardless, the September Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting will make for a tight call on the repo rate, with US Federal Reserve actions also likely to be an important factor in this regard.\"\n\nInflation expected to continue relative stability\n\nKoketso Mano, senior economist at FNB, says inflation was slightly lower than their 5.2% prediction but aligned with the consensus expectation. \"Headline inflation should continue its relative stability in July despite monthly pressures lifting strongly on utility cost increases and intensifying food price pressures.\"\n\nNevertheless, he says, fuel deflation, after the R1 per litre reduction in petrol prices, should once again mitigate these pressures.\n\nALSO READ: Inflation still high but could there be a repo rate cut up ahead?\n\nIn addition, he says headline inflation forecasts for 2024 and 2025 are being scaled down, as seen in the latest Sarb forecast as well, reflecting slowing global inflation, stable oil prices, a less depreciated rand and subdued domestic demand.\n\n\"However, upside risks are material as heightened geopolitical tensions affect logistics and the trade of goods. Furthermore, adverse weather conditions should support the premium on soft commodity prices. Therefore, while the IMF predicts that global inflation will slow to 4.4% in 2025, from 5.9% this year, the emphasis is that the road ahead should be bumpy.\"\n\nSome economists expect inflation to remain sticky around 5%\n\nJohannes (Matimba) Khosa and Nicky Weimar, economists at the Nedbank Group Economic Unit, say they expect inflation to be sticky around 5% until the end of the third quarter before decelerating to the Sarb's target during the fourth quarter, ending the year at 4.5% and stabilising around the midpoint throughout 2025.\n\n\"The downward pressure will come from muted global price pressures and subdued domestic demand, but base considerations, volatile international oil prices and high administrative price hikes will partly counter these. The outlook for food inflation also improved, with indications that the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern has passed and the La Ni\u00f1a pattern is forming, which could bring above-average rain next summer, potentially boosting domestic and global food production. These will contain crop prices and ultimately filter through to other food prices.\"\n\nThey assess the risks to their forecasts to be relatively balanced. \"The rand remains a worry given its sensitivity to shifts in global risk appetites, which will likely remain volatile until US disinflation gathers compelling downward traction and the Fed starts its rate-cutting cycle.\"\n\nKhosa and Weimar warn that any relapse in global growth or signs of a hard landing in the US could also trigger another bout of risk-off sentiment. \"In addition, the geopolitical landscape remains fraught with conflicts and tensions, which could again disrupt oil production and global supply chains.\n\n\"South Africa's complex structural challenges against the backdrop of the changing political landscape also continue to pose upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"\n\nThey point out that the Sarb's July MPC statement showed improvement in the inflation outlook, with CPI forecast to fall within the Sarb's target range in the fourth quarter compared to the second quarter of 2025 previously.\n\n\"At the same time, the economy continues to struggle and the US Fed is expected to start cutting interest rates in September. As a result, we believe that the Sarb will also begin its easing cycle in September, cutting by 25 basis points, followed by another reduction of the same magnitude in November, taking the repo rate to 7.75% and the prime lending rate at 11.25% by the end of 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ina_opperman@citizen.co.za", "name": "Ina Opperman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Repurchase agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u20132023_inflation_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u20132023 inflation surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Reserve_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South African Reserve Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South African rand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headline_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headline inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/inflation-repo-rate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The surge appears to be driven by non-core inflation, which accelerated to 10.64 per cent year-on-year.\n\nPrice increases were observed in fruits and vegetables (6.15 per cent), agricultural products (3.49 per cent), and energy (1.59 per cent).\n\nThis higher-than-anticipated inflation data raises uncertainty for investors who may have been anticipating a rate cut in August.\n\nThe central bank will likely reassess the situation based on this new information and its impact on future inflation projections.\n\nAttribution: Bloomberg and The National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) data", "source": {"uri": "en.amwalalghad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amwal Al Ghad"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yomna_yasser@en.amwalalghad.com", "name": "Yomna Yasser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Mexico", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u20132023_inflation_surge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021\u20132023 inflation surge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Statistics_and_Geography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institute of Statistics and Geography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://en.amwalalghad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mexicos-Inflation.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Most macroeconomic indicators show the Canadian economy in a slump and point to a further easing of price pressures.\n\nAlongside its rate decision, the Bank of Canada will publish a new inflation and economic growth forecast in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report.\n\nHaving raised interest rates 10 times in 2022 and 2023, the central bank is now reversing course.

The rate-setters at this point look set to again stick with the 50% benchmark.\n\nIn June 2023, following the post-election appointment of Turkey's new economic team led by finance minister and ex-Wall Street banker Mehmet Simsek, the Erdogan regime U-turned on monetary policy and launched a tightening process that is ongoing.\n\nFor June, TUIK also posted official inflation of 2% month on month after releasing 3% m/m figures for the three previous consecutive months.\n\nThe MPC's comments in its latest rate decision suggests that monthly inflation for July will again be released in the 3%s.\n\nBeyond July, TUIK is set to deliver further outcomes in the 2-3%s for the official monthly headline indicator.\n\nTUIK's inflation series reached its peak at 75.45% in May.

The Committee decided to keep the policy interest rate, which is the one-week repo auction interest rate, at a level of 50 percent.\n\nThe announcement regarding interest rates stated the following: \"The main trend of monthly inflation has shown a significant weakening in June. Leading indicators suggest that monthly inflation will temporarily increase in July due to non-monetary price and tax adjustments and supply-oriented developments in raw food prices, which are outside the scope of monetary policy. However, it is expected that the rise in the main trend will remain relatively limited. Indicators for the near term confirm that domestic demand, although still at an inflationary level, continues to slow down. The high level and rigidity in service inflation, inflation expectations, geopolitical risks, and food prices keep inflationary pressures alive. The Committee closely monitors the alignment of inflation expectations and pricing behavior with projections.\n\nThe effects of monetary tightening on loans and domestic demand are closely monitored. While the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, taking into account the delayed effects of monetary tightening, it reiterated its cautious stance towards upward risks on inflation. The tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until a significant and permanent decrease in the main trend of monthly inflation is achieved and inflation expectations approach the targeted range. In the event of a significant and permanent deterioration in inflation, the monetary policy stance will be tightened. The steadfastness in monetary policy will reduce the main trend of monthly inflation and strengthen the disinflation process through the balancing of domestic demand, real appreciation of the Turkish lira, and improvement in inflation expectations.\n\nAdditional measures have been taken regarding foreign currency loans to support macro-financial stability and the monetary transmission mechanism, taking into account credit growth and composition. If there are developments in credit and deposit markets that are different from the expected, the monetary transmission mechanism will continue to be supported with additional macro-prudential steps. Liquidity conditions are closely monitored considering possible developments. Sterilization tools will be effectively used by diversifying them when necessary.\n\nThe Committee will determine the monetary and financial conditions that will reduce the main trend of inflation and achieve the inflation target of 5 percent in the medium term, taking into account the delayed effects of monetary tightening.

The move comes as inflation in Canada decreased to 2.7% in June, down from May levels.\n\nCentral bankers in both Canada and the U.S. have been watching closely to see signs that inflation was moving lower. However, Canadian officials are now raising worries that their inflation may fall too fast as a result of weakening economic conditions.\n\n\"With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations. We need growth to pick up so inflation does not fall too much, even as we work to get inflation down to the 2% target,\" Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said today.\n\nSome U.S. economists echoed those messages this week. Some argue the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) shouldn't wait until its September meeting to cut, and should instead take action at its meeting next week.\n\nCanada's rate cuts have come as the country faces economic conditions that are unwinding faster than in the U.S. Canadian economists are particularly worried about employment levels and the health of consumer spending.\n\n\"Household spending, including both consumer purchases and housing, has been weak. There are signs of slack in the labor market. The unemployment rate has risen to 6.4%, with employment continuing to grow more slowly than the labor force and job seekers taking longer to find work,\" the Bank of Canada said in a statement accompanying the decision.\n\nEconomists following the U.S. have seen similar economic trends, with some believing the Federal Reserve already has enough evidence to act on interest rates. Recent employment reports show that job growth has been slowing in the U.S., with the unemployment rate ticking up.\n\nFormer New York Fed President Bill Dudley joined that group Wednesday when he warned in a Bloomberg column that the labor market in the U.S. could also rapidly decline, which he argued is an impetus for the Fed to act at its upcoming meeting at the end of July.\n\n\"Although it might already be too late to fend off a recession by cutting rates, dawdling now unnecessarily increases the risk,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiff_Macklem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiff Macklem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Unclaimed_Money", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Unclaimed Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/aLx3Ea8bZiOgOEcd2mNOV0nk62E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-2162672822-61289bb732814f3882cea778a52513fd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Although still hovering near the top of the BoC's target range of 1%-3%, inflation has held below 3% this year.\n\nThe bank will announce its monetary policy decision at 9:45 a.m. ET (1345 GMT). It will also release its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, which will include fresh forecasts on 2024 economic growth and inflation.\n\nCanada's economic growth has been lackluster this year, and some fear that high interest rates and rising unemployment could trigger a recession, even as some concerns persist that rapid rate cuts could stoke renewed inflation.\n\n\"Weak economic growth is giving the Bank of Canada confidence that inflation is heading lower,\" said Brooke Thackray, research analyst with Global X, a fund management company.\n\nThackray cautioned that a cut of more than 25 basis points however, could trigger inflation.\n\nHome prices and mortgage costs remain elevated in Canada, and some economists fear faster cuts could spur a rush of demand in Canada's rate-sensitive housing market, stoking inflation.

Despite these successes, there have been calls to modify the IT framework, particularly by targeting core inflation instead of the CPI headline, which includes volatile food prices. Proponents argue that monetary policy struggles to control supply-driven food inflation and that core inflation is a more stable target. In September, India will complete 8 years since it implemented inflation targeting (IT). Consistent with the experience of other countries, here, too, IT has been credited with improved outcomes: gentler and less volatile headline inflation, anchored inflationary expectations, improved communication and transparency, enhanced transmission of monetary policy, greater independence of the central bank, better coordination with fiscal authorities, and smooth conduct of exchange rate and reserve management policies in response to external shocks.\n\nRBI has remained as committed to a 'multiple indicators' approach as it was before IT's formal adoption. A text analysis of its statements shows that the monetary policy committee considers a range of factors before arriving at a decision, such as drivers of inflation, dynamics of food and core inflation, liquidity situation, global economic environment and risk appetite, output gap, capacity utilisation, inflationary expectations, exchange rate, employment. and fiscal deficit.\n\nDespite this apparent successful run, there are periodic calls to make changes in the IT framework. One such proposal is that instead of CPI headline, which includes demand-induced volatile food prices, core inflation or WPI inflation should be targeted. In the most direct official statement to this effect, the latest Economic Survey has proposed that 'India's inflation targeting framework should consider targeting core inflation, excluding food'.\n\nArguments in favour include:\n\nSince September 2016, RBI has changed the key policy rate 17 times, majority of them during two turbulent years. The first time in 2019-20 when policy rate was eased five times by a cumulative 185 bps to respond to a sharp growth slowdown. And again in 2022-23 when the policy rate was increased six times by a cumulative 210 bps in response to accelerated inflation emanating from global shocks. During the remaining six years, policy rate was changed only six times, about once every year.\n\nBut what if food prices become even more volatile during the coming years, due to climate change-induced heatwave conditions and erratic rain patterns?\n\nThe answer lies in updating the CPI headline basket. The current basket accords a weight of 45.8% to food. The basket was calculated in 2011-12 and has not been revised since then, even though per-capita incomes have nearly doubled meanwhile. To project the correct weight of food in India's consumption basket, we estimated the relationship between the share of food and per-capita income across countries, and a similar relationship for Indian states. The estimates robustly confirm that the share of food in consumption declines as income levels increase. While a Bangladeshi spends 45% on food, a Vietnamese spends 33%, a Brazilian 24%, and a South Korean only 14%. Similar dispersion is seen across Indian states (as of 2011-12).\n\nThe estimated weight of food for India at today's per-capita income would be less than 40%, instead of the current 45.8%. And it would decline to below 30% in a decade from now. This correction itself should ameliorate the concerns on account of food inflation being a part of the inflation target.\n\nDoes it mean that India needs no review or revision of its IT framework at all? Not really. In fact, it would be useful to conduct an independent review around issues such as:", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesale_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wholesale price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_gap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Output gap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government budget balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111996355,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-266141,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 2036, "textEnd": 2050}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Household spending, including both consumer purchases and housing, has been weak. There are signs of lack in the labour market. The unemployment rate has risen to 6.4%, with employment continuing to grow more slowly than the labour force and job seekers taking longer to find work.\"\n\nOn inflation, the Bank painted a less dovish picture than what was communicated in their June decision. However, it still noted that headline inflation moderated last month, preferred core measures remained below 3%, and that the breadth of price increases in the CPI is near its historical norm.\n\nThe accompanying Monetary Policy Report (MPR) showed a downgrade to annual average real GDP growth in 2024 (1.2% vs 1.5%), reflecting a weaker-than-expected first quarter performance. However, growth in 2024Q3 is seen as accelerating to 2.8% annualized. For 2025, the Bank's GDP growth forecast is relatively unchanged at 2.1%. Despite the dovish overall tone in the statement, we're still below the Bank in terms of expected GDP growth next year. This reflects our relatively more cautious view around consumption (and housing) that will continue to feel the pinch of elevated rates. In 2026, the Bank now sees growth at 2.4% versus 1.9% in the April MPR.\n\nThe Bank upgraded its 2024 forecast for overall inflation (2.4% on a Q4/Q4 basis, versus 2.2% in April). In 2024Q3, inflation is expected at 2.3%. Meanwhile, it's 2025 and 2026 forecasts were downgraded a touch (2.0% in both years versus forecasts of 2.1%). Meanwhile, core inflation (expressed as the average of the Bank's preferred measures) is seen at 2.4% this year, before easing to 2% in 2025 and 2026. For the latter two years, inflation is expected to remain well behaved, even with economic growth forecast to exceed potential, as slack built up this year is absorbed.\n\nKey Implications\n\nAnd just like that, Canadians were treated to a bit more rate relief today. With job market slack rapidly building, the economy in excess supply, inflation expectations continuing to normalize and U.S. policymakers now openly musing about lowing their own policy rate, the Bank of Canada was comfortable enough to trim its policy rate. The BoC doesn't appear overly concerned about the recent regression in core inflation trends. We should note that even with today's move, a 4.50% policy rate that's well north of inflation is still quite restrictive and as such, the economy will still its pressure.\n\nWhere do we go from here?

It is above all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists, whose median estimate was a 5.38% reading in the first half of July.\n\nINEGI reported that consumer prices increased 0.71% in the first 15 days of the month compared to the second half of June.\n\nThe closely-watched annual core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, fell to 4.02% from 4.13% across June. The rate was on par with the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe annual core rate has declined every month since February 2023.\n\nINEGI data shows that fruit and vegetables were 25.69% more expensive in the first half of July than in the same period of last year. It was the highest annual inflation rate for those products since the first half of August 2017. The steepest annual price increases were for chayotes, tomatoes, green tomatoes and onions.\n\nOverall inflation for fruit and vegetables across June was a slightly less painful 19.73%.\n\nAnnual inflation for the agricultural products category was 14.33% in the first half of the month, tempered by a 4.82% year-over-year increase in the cost of meat.\n\nAndr\u00e9s Abad\u00eda, chief Latin America economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that adverse climatic conditions and \"external factors\" are the main drivers of inflation in Mexico this year.\n\nEnergy prices, including those for electricity and gasoline, increased 7.30% in annual terms in the first 15 days of July, while services were 5.17% more expensive.\n\nPrices for processed food, beverages and tobacco increased 4.03% annually, while non-food goods were 1.94% more expensive.\n\nWith headline inflation continuing to rise, it appears less likely that Mexico's central bank will cut its benchmark interest rate after its board's next monetary policy meeting on Aug. 8.\n\nHowever, two economists quoted in a Bloomberg report believe that the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) -- which targets 3% headline inflation -- will make a cut to its 11% rate on the second Thursday in August.\n\n\"My feeling is central bankers will prioritize the improvement we see in core measures, which came in line with estimates, and cut,\" said Jessica Rold\u00e1n, chief economist at Casa de Bolsa Finamex and a former Banxico official.\n\nHowever, she acknowledged that \"it's tricky to lower rates when this print should increase the bank's inflation estimates.\"\n\nKimberley Sperrfechter, an emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note that \"our base case remains that Banxico will resume its easing cycle next month.\"\n\nThe central bank cut its key rate from a record high 11.25% to 11% in March, making its first reduction to borrowing costs in over three years.\n\nDespite predicting a cut next month, Sperrfechter recognized that the probability of that occurring is diminishing \"somewhat\" due to the data showing that headline inflation reached its highest level in 14 months in the first half of July.\n\nGabriela Siller, director of economic analysis at Mexico's Banco Base, wrote on X on Wednesday morning that the Bank of Mexico \"should wait longer to continue with interest rate cuts.\"\n\nJonathan Heath, one of the central bank's board members, said on X earlier this month that he agreed with the assessment of Jerome Powell, chair of the United States Federal Reserve, that \"more benign inflation data\" is needed before interest rates can be cut.\n\n\"He said it for the Federal Reserve, but it applies equally to the case of Mexico,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri":

That brought it down to 4.5%, and the two said more cuts were likely if inflation continued to cool in line with forecasts.\n\nMACKLEM ON EXCESS SUPPLY\n\n\"The economy is in excess supply. There is slack in the labour market and that is acting to pull inflation down. Our assessment is there's enough excess supply in the economy. The ingredients increasingly are in place to bring inflation back to the 2% target. We don't need more excess supply. We need growth to start picking up, we need job creation to start picking up, to absorb the excess supply in the economy and get inflation sustainably back to target.\"\n\nROGERS ON BALANCE SHEET\n\n\"We don't think we're at a normalized state on our balance sheet yet. We think there's more room to go on settlement balances, but as we do get closer to what we think is a normal state, we'll be paying very, very close attention. We're talking to market participants on a regular basis. So we'll be keeping an eye on this.\"\n\nMACKLEM ON RATE CUT DECISION\n\n\"In terms of the decision, there was a clear consensus to cut by 25 basis points. There was clear consensus that the expected path of the policy rate is lower. But we're not on a predetermined path. We're going to take it one meeting at a time. That was really the main outcome of the meeting.\"\n\nMACKLEM ON MONETARY POLICY\n\n\"Our assessment is monetary policy is still restrictive ... Inflation is still 2.7%, core inflation is about the same. We still need to get inflation down. So we still need monetary policy to be somewhat restrictive. We don't need to be as restrictive as it's been. We've made a lot of progress. We're confident that the ingredients are in place to get us back to target. It doesn't need to be as restrictive as it's been and that's why we've cut our policy rate at the last two meetings.\"\n\nMACKLEM ON NOT WANTING TO WEAKEN ECONOMY TOO MUCH\n\n\"We want to balance the risks on both sides. We are determined to get inflation back to 2% but we also don't want to weaken the economy too much and have inflation go below our 2% target. So those are all the things we're going to be weighing going forward. We're going to take it one meeting at a time.\"\n\nMACKLEM ON POLICY DIVERGENCE\n\n\"There are limits to how far Canadian and U.S. rates diverge. We are still not close to that limit and with inflation showing more signs of easing in the United States, my sense is that divergence is not going to be particularly serious.\"\n\n(Reporting by Fergal Smith, Anna Mehler Paperny and Ismail Shakil; Compiled by Fergal Smith)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Data shows that India's inflation rate is relatively lower compared to major global economies. For instance, Argentina's inflation rate is around 60 times higher than that of India. Did you know that Argentina tops the list of countries most affected by inflation, with a rate of 272 percent? Recently, the World of Statistics published a list on the social media platform X, highlighting the inflation rates of various countries. It is a relief to know that India is not in the top 10 nations. The top ten countries on this list are Argentina, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Venezuela, Nigeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Russia.\n\nSyria holds the second position on this list, with an inflation rate of 140 percent. Turkey is third, with an inflation rate of 71.6 percent. Following Turkey, Lebanon has an inflation rate of 51.6 percent, Venezuela 51.4 percent, Nigeria 34.19 percent, Egypt 27.5 percent, Pakistan 12.6 percent, Bangladesh 9.72 percent, and Russia 8.6 percent. India ranks 13th on this list, with an inflation rate of 5.08 percent. To put Argentina's inflation in perspective, it's approximately 60 times higher than India's. Notably, India's neighbouring countries, Pakistan and Bangladesh, are among the top 10 countries with the highest inflation. Pakistan's inflation rate is roughly two and a half times greater than India.\n\nInflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, causing purchasing power to fall. In other words, when inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did before. This economic concept is typically measured annually and is expressed as a percentage. Inflation can be caused by various factors, including increased demand for goods and services, rising production costs, and changes in the supply of money.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

The Eurozone inflation rate witnessed a 2.5% year-on-year growth in June 2024.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently warned that inflation in major economies has been declining slower than anticipated, complicating monetary policy normalization.

Falling gas prices are expected to push down the overall reading while moderating housing and medical services prices contribute to a softer core reading.\n\nAnalysts say several consecutive months of encouraging inflation data are helping bolster the Federal Reserve's confidence that inflation is under control, which investors hope will pave the way for at least one interest rate cut this year.\n\nEconomists forecast the overall PCE Price Index to rise 0.08% on a monthly basis and 2.5% on an annual basis in June, according to FactSet's consensus estimates. The index was flat on a monthly basis in May. Economists expect the core measure of PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, to rise 0.10% on a monthly basis and 2.5% on an annual basis.\n\nMuch of the source data for the June PCE report will be drawn from the Consumer and Producer Price Index reports released earlier this month, so economists already have a detailed window into the likely path of the data. While the CPI report makes headlines because of its earlier release, the PCE report is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. The central bank targets 2% PCE inflation as part of its mandate -- a milestone analysts say could be around the corner.\n\n\"This is going to be a benign reading,\" says Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide Mutual. That's good news for the Fed. Several consecutive months of cooler inflation readings \"puts the flareup we saw in the first quarter squarely in the rearview mirror,\" she says. \"We're likely on course for continued disinflation and good readings for the coming months.\" Bostjancic expects no change in the headline monthly rate for June -- slightly below the consensus estimate -- and a 0.1% uptick in the core index.\n\nWhile falling gasoline prices will depress the overall inflation rate, Bostjancic says the Fed will pay more attention to the core reading. She expects continued disinflation in the goods category, along with more progress on shelter inflation that will mirror the CPI data released earlier this month. \"There are encouraging signs in the CPI reading that rental inflation and housing price pressures overall are easing,\" she says. Sticky housing inflation has been one of the biggest contributors to elevated inflation over the past year. While some data on rent inflation has pointed to a moderation of that trend, a cooling in the shelter category of the CPI and PCE index had failed to materialize until recently.\n\nData from the last few months \"suggests that we're starting to see the actual rental inflation component in the CPI and PCE [indexes] catch up with what we've been seeing in the new lease data for months,\" Bostjancic explains.\n\nOther components of the PCE index may have ticked up in June, but analysts aren't all that worried about reinflation risk. Bostjancic points to asset management fees, which could rise on a strong equity market. \"That's really a reflection of the equity market doing well,\" rather than a true inflationary reading, she explains.\n\nAnd while producer price data came in stronger than expected in June, analysts from Bank of America point out that the components of the index used to calculate PCE inflation were relatively soft. Prices for medical and hospital services fell in June, for example. Overall, Bank of America's analysts expect June's PCE report to show inflation in line with the Fed's 2% target. \"In sum, disinflation has gotten back on track over the last two months,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Fed is almost universally expected to leave interest rates steady at its upcoming July meeting, but investors are already looking ahead to rate cuts in September or December -- or both. As of Wednesday, bond futures markets were pricing in a roughly 90% chance of a 0.25% rate cut in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nCentral bank officials have repeatedly said they are looking for more confidence that PCE inflation is moving toward their 2% target before they will cut rates. June PCE readings in line with expectations will \"surely increase and boost that confidence,\" Bostjancic says. Barring any adverse inflation readings between now and September, she says the Fed is \"poised to cut rates.\"", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_hansen@morningstar.com", "name": "Sarah Hansen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Producer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Futures exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Mercantile Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/2yYJL2ZtTHs89lowUlwagqupcKk=/4801x2701/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/XF7WENSYN5BFBFLPPFH7BJYUHE.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

It said that hardships caused to low-income citizens by food price rise could be \"handled through direct benefit transfers or coupons for specified purchases valid for appropriate durations\".\n\nThe Economic Survey, tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament a day ahead of the Union Budget for 2024-'25, details the state of the country's economy.\n\nIndia's retail inflation increased to 5.08% in June, the highest in four months. The price rise indicator stood at 4.80% in May, 4.83% in April and 4.85% in March.\n\nHowever, demand-driven core inflation that leaves out food and fuel prices was around 3% in June, The Economic Times reported.\n\nFood inflation, which accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket, rose to 9.36% in June from 8.69% in May at the national level. The price rise in food items was higher in urban areas (9.55%) than in rural areas (9.15%).\n\nThe highest inflation was in vegetables at 29.32%, followed by \"pulses and products\" at 16.07%.\n\nJune was the eighth consecutive month when food inflation was above 8%.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terms of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economic_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economic Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitharaman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Prepared", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Prepared", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/174245-jrslexphbs-1652279579.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

It is no different for the economy. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, says Labour has been handed the worst economy of any incoming government since 1945, when Britain was loaded with wartime debt and its cities pockmarked with craters.\n\nMuch of the gloom is warranted. Britain's productivity record since the financial crisis has been feeble. Parts of the last government's agenda, especially around Brexit, contributed to the sense of stagnation. The public finances are stretched thin. Hence Labour's emphasis on growth: central to its election campaign was a promise to get Britain's economy growing faster than that of any other country. Muddying the picture somewhat, however, is the fact that a version of this milestone may already have been passed -- under the Tories.\n\nBritain has resoundingly bounced back from its brief recession in late 2023, and at a speedier pace than most forecasters expected. The economy grew by around 1.1% over the first half of 2024. That compares with 0.8% or so for America and Canada over the same period, and 0.3% to 0.5% for France, Germany and Italy. Throw in Japan's lacklustre numbers and on an annualised basis Britain is likely to have outpaced the rest of the 7 over the final months of Rishi Sunak's premiership (see chart). This expansion was almost entirely services-driven, and was probably helped along by a strong rebound in household borrowing after a painful adjustment to higher interest rates.\n\nThat is not the only way in which the picture now looks sunnier. Annual headline inflation is back at the Bank of England's target of 2%. The main gauges of underlying inflation tracked by the wonks in Threadneedle Street are also falling, if bumpily (see chart). One particular fixation for central bankers is services inflation, thought to better reflect how entrenched inflation has become by peeling away all goods prices, not just those of volatile commodities like food and energy. That should tee up a first cut to interest rates, perhaps as soon as the next meeting of the Bank of England's monetary-policy committee on August 1st. Financial markets expect two quarter-of-a-percentage-point cuts before the end of 2024.\n\nSterling has also crept back to its pre-Brexit level against a basket of foreign currencies, though it remains weaker against the dollar. The 100 share index has risen by 5.8% this year, more than in the four prior years combined (if still behind its European and American equivalents).\n\nCaution is in order. A few good months, however welcome, cannot undo years of underperformance. At best, it might persuade the Office for Budget Responsibility, a fiscal watchdog, not to nudge down its optimistic productivity-growth numbers, which would make Ms Reeves's spending choices, already tough, even more constrained. But it is still in everyone's interests that this growth spurt is maintained. Can it be?\n\nLabour is trying to keep the momentum going with an early blitz of policy announcements. But they will take a while to have a big impact. Take Labour's aspiration to build more houses and infrastructure. Boosters say that the ensuing construction activity will instantly raise growth. But Britain already has a high employment rate and limited appetite for more migration. An investment boom would mean redirecting workers from other (admittedly less productive) projects, dampening the uplift to aggregate growth. What matters more would be the boost to the supply side of the economy if and when all those homes, pylons and wind farms get built. Those gains would raise the growth numbers later and gradually.\n\nSo the question is whether this recovery can carry on under its own steam. One risk is that inflation hasn't quite been shaken off. Persistent inflation would force the Bank of England to keep interest rates elevated, weighing on asset prices and the economy. Pessimists point to the fact that core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) has come down but is still running at a 3.6% annual rate, well above target. Services inflation is even higher, at 5.7%. Overall headline inflation has been flattered by big declines in energy and durable goods prices, but those are probably one-off drops.\n\nWages, which feed into inflation, are rising at 5.2% annually, a rate far too high to be consistent with the bank's target inflation rate. Wage growth on new job contracts, a more forward-looking measure, is still around its peak of 7%, according to a tracker from Indeed, a jobs site; normal would be more like 3-4%, which is where America and the euro zone stand on this gauge. Ms Reeves is currently deciding whether to accept a 5.5% pay rise for some public-sector workers that has been proposed by independent pay bodies (the Treasury had previously budgeted for 3%).\n\nThe other big risk is that growth falters because consumers pull back or because of changes in the labour market. Recently released retail sales figures for June were well below forecasters' expectations. More significantly, much of Britain's labour-market loosening since June 2022 has been due to falling vacancies but the unemployment rate has also started to rise and is now at 4.4%. Historically, quick rises in this rate have often presaged recessions. An American economist, Claudia Sahm, formalised this pattern into the \"Sahm Rule\", a real-time recession indicator that is met whenever the three-month average of the unemployment rate rises by at least 0.5 percentage points within a year. Britain has now triggered this threshold (though the rule was designed for America and has misfired in Britain before.)\n\nIf Labour gets lucky, these two risks might offset each other. A softening labour market could pull down inflation and make space for looser monetary policy to buffer growth. But they could easily knock things off course. A persistent-inflation scenario would be especially troubling. The Bank of England's credibility has been tarnished but not shattered by the inflation surge that Britain has experienced in recent years -- another jolt could do real damage.\n\nReal as these risks are, the economy seems to be doing fine for now. The stronger showing complicates Labour's insistence that its inheritance has been uniquely dire. But listen at the door of Number 11 Downing Street and you may hear sighs of relief. Labour needs the economy to grow faster if living standards and public services are to improve. Just don't expect it to admit an upswing was already under way. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One is through an increase in the production cost of goods or services, generally referred to as cost-push inflation; the other happens through an increase in the demand for goods and services due to increased supply of money in the market, which is referred to as demand-pull inflation.\n\nWhen more jobs and higher wages increase people's income level, it leads to a rise in consumer spending. The overall effect is an increase in aggregate demand, which gives firms the opportunity to increase the prices of their goods and services. As soon as this happens on a large enough scale, it leads to an increase in demand-pull inflation.\n\nThe current inflation in Bangladesh has not been driven by an increase in the money supply in the market. Rather, a large portion of the active labour force is unemployed or underpaid due to the impact of post-Covid global factors and the war in Ukraine.\n\nA low unemployment rate is unquestionably good in general, but it can cause inflation because zero or near-zero unemployment means people have higher disposable income. The unemployment rate in Bangladesh was 4.38 percent in 2019, which climbed to 5.21 percent in 2020 due to the pandemic's affects. The unemployment rate dropped to a low of 4.7 percent in 2022. The Ukraine war that started in February 2022 halted the post-pandemic recovery process -- and employment generation could not gain much momentum. So, it is evident that low unemployment (or an economy with full employment), which is a cause for demand-pull inflation, is not applicable in the Bangladesh context.\n\nThe inflation rate as of May 2024 was 9.89 percent, whereas it was 5.57 percent in January 2020. So, what we have in Bangladesh is cost-push inflation. The devaluation of our currency has led to an increase in the import cost of raw materials, leading to an increase in the overall price level. The official exchange rate of the US dollar against the taka was 84.86 in 2021. It was Tk 103.02 and 109.75 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Finally, it stood at Tk 117.00 after the introduction of a crawling peg exchange rate.\n\nThe value of a country's currency and its exchange rate significantly influences the level of inflation. If a country's currency depreciates, the cost of imported goods affects domestic pricing. Thus, a weaker currency triggers inflation.\n\nTo control inflation, the standard response of a central bank would be to raise official interest rates. When the central bank increases interest rates, borrowing for commercial banks becomes more expensive. Both consumers and businesses might think twice about taking loans for major purchases or investments. This slows down spending, typically lowering overall demand, which leads to reduced inflation.\n\nThis monetary instrument to curb inflation is best suited for inflation triggered by an excessive supply of money. But in the case of inflation in Bangladesh, it is triggered by a rise in the cost of production, especially due to an excessive rise in the dollar price. In August 2021, Bangladesh Bank had $48.1 billion in foreign currency reserves, which came down to $24.2 billion in May 2024.\n\nHere, it is evident that the higher inflation rate prevailing in Bangladesh is not due to demand-pull inflation; it is due to a shortage of Forex reserves and an increase in the dollar price. So, contractionary monetary policy will not function here as expected.\n\nIncreased policy rate and the introduction of a specific margin plus Six-Month Moving Average Rate of Treasury Bill (SMART) as a lending rate will make the economy grow. It will limit the earning capacity of consumers and affect producers, leading them to lower production. Thus, a vicious cycle will take over the economy, pulling the growth rate down or even push it towards negative growth.\n\nSince the current inflation in Bangladesh cannot be most effectively addressed with a contractionary monetary policy, an alternative financial regulatory intervention through the repatriation of overdue export proceeds and curbing money laundering is needed.\n\nIn 2022-23, the mismatch between the actual realisation reported by Bangladesh Bank and the shipment figure provided by the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) was $12.08 billion. EPB data showed that goods and services exports stood at $63.05 billion in FY23, whereas the central bank reported that Bangladesh received $50.97 billion in the same year. There may be some differences between the export data of the Bangladesh Bank and the EPB due to disagreements and the time lag effect. But such a huge gap must be investigated meticulously to find any unrepatriated export amount.\n\nAccording to Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Tk 26,400 crore or $3.1 billion is illegally siphoned out of Bangladesh every year. Reportedly, hundi, over-invoicing, under-invoicing, and trade mis-invoicing are the primary ways of money laundering.\n\nCorruption has a negative impact on the economic growth of any country, as it reduces investment and consequently lowers the growth rate of industrial output. Undoubtedly, corruption is a big hindrance to sustainable development. But it's not the biggest hindrance for an economy. When money acquired through corruption circulates within the economy, it still generates employment and thus contributes to increasing GDP. The biggest hindrance to sustainable development is the money getting laundered abroad. Money, whether earned legally or illegally, once laundered out of the country, is most likely lost forever and will not make any contribution to its economic activities.

With food accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, addressing food inflation is not merely an economic necessity but a socio-political imperative. The recent spike in food inflation, driven by escalating prices of vegetables, cereals, and fruits, underscores the urgency for comprehensive and sustained interventions. Historical data reveals that India's most sustained period of low inflation, between 2000 and 2006, was characterised by stable food prices.\n\nDuring this period, headline CPI averaged 3.9 per cent and food inflation was at a modest 2.5 per cent. However, this stability has been increasingly elusive in recent years. In June 2024, food inflation surged to a six-month high of 9.4 per cent, exacerbated by extreme heat waves that devastated vegetable yields. This trend is particularly concerning as it highlights the vulnerability of the Indian economy to climatic variations and supply chain disruptions. The Covid19 pandemic has further complicated the inflation landscape, with food inflation averaging 6.4 per cent between 2020-21 and 2023-24, outpacing the overall CPI inflation of 5.9 per cent. Projections that retail inflation would stabilise below 5 per cent have been upended by recent data, indicating that the fight against inflation is far from over.\n\nThis persistent high inflation, especially in the food sector, demands urgent and strategic responses. One of the most pressing issues is the impact of weather conditions on agricultural productivity. The heat wave this year serves as a stark reminder of the need for climate-resilient agricultural practices. Investments in advanced technologies such as precision farming and drip irrigation can significantly enhance crop yields and reduce dependence on erratic monsoon patterns. Educating farmers on modern agricultural techniques is equally crucial in mitigating the effects of adverse weather conditions. Improving supply chain efficiency is another critical area.\n\nEnhancements in cold storage facilities and transportation networks can drastically reduce post-harvest losses, ensuring that food reaches consumers in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, promoting crop diversification and supporting allied sectors like dairy and poultry can provide farmers with alternative income sources, thereby reducing the impact of single crop failures on overall food prices. Market reforms that streamline regulations and promote digital marketplaces are essential for ensuring fair prices for both farmers and consumers.\n\nEnabling farmers to sell directly to consumers through digital platforms can reduce intermediary costs and enhance price transparency. Strengthening subsidised food programmes like the Public Distribution System (PDS) and implementing stricter measures to prevent hoarding can protect vulnerable populations from the adverse effects of inflation. The budget today presents a critical opportunity for the government to address the immediate issue of rising food prices and establish long-term measures for inflation stability. Policymakers must tailor solutions to the specific needs of different demographic segments.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_diversification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural diversification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precision agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_irrigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drip irrigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/retail-inflation-iStock.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Economists had forecast it to reach 5.27%.\n\nMexico's central bank targets inflation at 3%, plus or minus one percentage point, and its deputy governor has warned that headline inflation should show a clear downward trend before it lowers its benchmark rate.\n\nBanxico delivered a 25-basis-point cut in March but voted to hold the rate at 11.00% in May and June due to persistent inflation.\n\nDespite the latest negative headline reading, market participants believe an Aug. 8 rate cut is still on the table due to reduced core price pressures.\n\n\"Our base case remains that Banxico will resume its easing cycle next month, but with inflation now at a 14-month high, the chances of that cut have diminished somewhat,\" Capital Economics emerging markets economist Kimberley Sperrfechter said.\n\nThe closely watched core price index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.18% in early July, with annual core inflation reaching 4.02%. Both were in line with market forecasts.\n\nPantheon Macroeconomics' chief economist for Latin America, Andres Abadia, said the controlled core inflation, a stabilizing Mexican peso and slowing domestic demand give Banxico room for maneuver despite the \"ugly\" headline figure.\n\n\"In the immediate term, the core numbers suggest that Banxico will be able to cut the main interest rate by 25 basis points,\" he said.

It is anticipated that there will be easy money across all customer segments and most sectors,\" it said.\n\n\"Credit institutions expect to ease credit standards due to the favourable macroeconomic outlook and the positive effects of government policies, sectoral development guidance, and credit management directives from the government and the SBV.\"\n\nHowever, potential negative factors affecting credit demand in the near future include adverse developments in the real estate market, customers' ability to utilise alternative financial resources, and decreased consumer confidence, indicated the survey results.\n\nMSB is actively supporting clients in seizing opportunities and advancing agricultural production and business with promotional programmes offering interest rates starting at just 7 per cent per annum, catering to diverse needs from production and business to consumer spending.\n\nNotably, loan limits can reach up to over $366,000, financing up to 95 per cent of capital utilisation plans for asset investment and working capital needs, with no prepayment penalties.\n\nVIB is also aligning with the anticipated demand in the real estate market for the last six months of the year, targeting high-quality customer segments.\n\nIt has launched a home loan package with a total limit of $1.25 billion and competitive interest rates starting from 5.9 per cent per annum. Customers transferring from other banks to VIB will receive an additional 0.4 per cent interest rate reduction.\n\nLe Ngoc Lam, CEO of BIDV, said that this bank will continue to implement measures to boost credit growth in the last six months of the year; organise meetings, dialogues, and connections between businesses and banks to identify and address difficulties; and continue to deploy credit packages and reduce interest rates to support credit growth according to SBV programmes and directives.\n\nRegarding inflation in the last six months of the year, BIDV's report indicates that inflationary pressure in Q2 is rising, with the consumer price index (CPI) averaging a 4.4 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, the highest since Q4 of 2022.\n\nSpecific increases include 7.63 per cent in medical care, driven by new medical service pricing, 8.15 per cent in education due to rising tuition fees, and a strong 9 per cent increase in household electricity prices due to higher demand and adjustments in electricity pricing by Vietnam Electricity.\n\n\"When inflation rises, the increasing prices of goods and services reduce the value of money, prompting individuals and businesses to spend more to avoid losing value. This heightened demand for money leads to higher interest rates to balance the money supply and demand,\" said economist Dr. Nguyen Tri Hieu.\n\nAs interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers also increases, which reduces the purchasing power in the economy and subsequently lowers consumption and production demand, Hieu added. \"When consumption and production demand decline, the prices of goods and services also decrease, helping to curb inflation,\" he said.\n\nAdditionally, food and beverage prices increased by 4.48 per cent, due to high prices of foodstuffs compared to last year (15 per cent increase) and a rise in pork prices in Q2.\n\nDr. Can Van Luc, chief economist of BIDV, said inflationary pressure in the last six months is expected to be higher than in the same period of 2023 due to cost-push factors.\n\n\"Particularly, high energy prices, raw material costs, logistics expenses, and adjustments in state-managed prices such as electricity, tuition fees, and minimum wages from July 1 will contribute to this trend. Additionally, the increase in money supply is expected to be higher along with economic recovery,\" he predicted.\n\nThe inflation target for this year is set between 4.5 and 5 per cent, while the CPI has already risen by 4.3 per cent by the end of Q2, raising the need to adjust inflation rates to support the economy as inflation and interest rates are closely linked.\n\nNguyen Ba Hung, principal country economist from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Vietnam, told VIR that policymakers will need to balance objectives between controlling inflation and promoting economic growth.\n\n\"For the first half, although the inflation rate is 4.3 per cent, examining monthly inflation contributions shows that the rise is mainly from the end of 2023, with only 1.24 per cent of the 4.3 per cent total coming from the first half of this year,\" Hung said. \"These figures suggest that while inflation seems higher compared to last year, with current growth conditions, monthly price increases will not be excessively volatile, making a significant inflation surge unlikely.\"", "source": {"uri": "vir.com.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vietnam Investment Review -

That brought it down to 4.5%, and the two said more cuts were likely if inflation continued to cool in line with forecasts.\n\nMACKLEM ON EXCESS SUPPLY\n\n\"The economy is in excess supply. There is slack in the labour market and that is acting to pull inflation down. Our assessment is there's enough excess supply in the economy. The ingredients increasingly are in place to bring inflation back to the 2% target. We don't need more excess supply. We need growth to start picking up, we need job creation to start picking up, to absorb the excess supply in the economy and get inflation sustainably back to target.\"\n\nROGERS ON BALANCE SHEET\n\n\"We don't think we're at a normalized state on our balance sheet yet. We think there's more room to go on settlement balances, but as we do get closer to what we think is a normal state, we'll be paying very, very close attention. We're talking to market participants on a regular basis. So we'll be keeping an eye on this.\"\n\nMACKLEM ON RATE CUT DECISION\n\n\"In terms of the decision, there was a clear consensus to cut by 25 basis points. There was clear consensus that the expected path of the policy rate is lower. But we're not on a predetermined path. We're going to take it one meeting at a time. That was really the main outcome of the meeting.\"\n\nMACKLEM ON MONETARY POLICY\n\n\"Our assessment is monetary policy is still restrictive ... Inflation is still 2.7%, core inflation is about the same. We still need to get inflation down. So we still need monetary policy to be somewhat restrictive. We don't need to be as restrictive as it's been. We've made a lot of progress. We're confident that the ingredients are in place to get us back to target. It doesn't need to be as restrictive as it's been and that's why we've cut our policy rate at the last two meetings.\"\n\n(Reporting by Fergal Smith, Anna Mehler Paperny and Ismail Shakil; compiled by Fergal Smith)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Undoubtedly, inflation remains the top enemy of discretionary retailers, consumers, and just about everybody. With Canada's inflation number falling to 2.7% for the month of June, it certainly seems like those endless price increases are about to become a heck of a lot less noticeable.\n\nAs inflation inches ever so closer to that desired 2% level, with certain goods experiencing deflationary pressures (negative inflation), perhaps it's not too far-fetched to think another two interest rate cuts will be in for 2024. Of course, some hawks believe we won't get another rate reduction until next year. However, if inflation keeps playing ball (and it has of late), I'd argue there's a good chance that rates could fall like a rock from here.\n\nThe big question, however, is whether we're going to witness those early pandemic levels of rates. Indeed, the stock market (especially small- and mid-cap names, which have heated up in recent trading sessions) may add to its robust rally.\n\nWith the TSX Index recently surging to hit new all-time highs, investors who are on the sidelines may wish to get into some of the less-loved discretionary retail plays while they're still cheap because they may not stay cheap forever, especially as rates and inflation feel gravity for a change. Indeed, lower rates and inflation could be a double shot in the arm of the consumer.\n\nOn the one hand, consumers will feel less burdened by their outstanding debts. That shores up more cash for those nice-to-have kinds of goods. Additionally, borrowing more to buy certain big-ticket discretionaries makes more sense in a lower-rate climate.\n\nFurther, lower inflation (and perhaps a bit of deflation on certain items) could feed the appetite for bargains again. Indeed, discount retailers and off-price stores have been faring incredibly well in recent years as shoppers look to go to great lengths to avoid those awful price increases.\n\nFinally, lower rates and inflation are good news for the economy and investor sentiment as a whole. With early signs suggesting a resilient consumer, perhaps discretionary plays like Canadian Tire (TSX:CTC.A) are worth stashing in your shopping cart this July.\n\nCanadian Tire is a mid-cap ($8.1 billion market cap) retailer that's been hurting since peaking way back in 2021. The stock is down around 33% from those heights, with a dividend yield of 5.1%. Undoubtedly, management noted the challenges facing consumers. But these challenges, I believe, could fade fast as rates and inflation keep falling.\n\nThe big question is whether 2% (or maybe a bit lower) inflation and markedly lower rates could spark a spending spree for those discretionary goods consumers have held off on buying over these past few inflationary years. Canadian Tire could be a massive beneficiary of pent-up demand for various big-ticket goods once rates and inflation become a thing of the past.", "source": {"uri": "fool.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_frenette@fool.ca", "name": "Joey Frenette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discount store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tire", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_yield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dividend yield"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1330234595.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

But there's a lot more rate cutting ahead", "body": "The Bank of Canada did the expected (and the right thing) by trimming the policy rate for the second meeting in a row to 4.5% from 4.75%. More relief will be coming.\n\nYet again, the BoC stressed that the economy is operating with excess slack.\n\nThe Bank sees real GDP growth of +1.2% this year which is roughly 100 basis points below the economy's long-term potential, and the projection of a +2.1% pickup in 2025 and +2.4% in 2026 must imply in the forecast that rates are coming down much further because there is no such re-acceleration absent more policy stimulus. Even then, the BoC acknowledges that this growth pickup will only \"gradually absorb excess supply through 2025 and 2026.\"\n\nSo, while the press statement did mention that shelter and select service-sector inflation remains stubbornly high, there is nothing in theory or practice that posits higher inflation in an economy running with spare capacity.\n\nWhen you model out where the overnight rate should be in such a period of economic slack, it should be closer to 2% than 4.5%. Even under an economy in perfect balance with no excess supply, the neutral rate is an appropriate benchmark and that resides at 2.75%. So there is no question that the BoC has a long row to hoe.\n\nWe have a situation where the CPIX inflation rate (that eliminates the noise from the eight most volatile components) is at +1.9%, just about where it was in early 2020 before the pandemic hit. Strip out the mortgage interest nonsense, which is not a price anyone really pays at the shopping mall, inflation is also running at +1.9%. The unemployment rate, at 6.4%, is almost a full percentage point above where it was in early 2020 and up +160 basis points from the cycle low -- a Sahm Rule recession has already been triggered. The job vacancy rate, at 3.2%, also is pretty well back to where it was pre-COVID. Where was the BoC policy rate back then -- keeping in mind that there was no \"excess supply\" in early 2020? Try 1.75%. So when I say the Bank has a long row to hoe... it is a very long row, indeed.\n\nIn fact, while the Bank is telling us that policy decisions will be made meeting by meeting, it let the cat out of the bag with this little ditty: \"The breadth of price increases across components of the CPI is now near its historical norm.\" Well, guess what the \"historical norm\" is for the overnight rate? Try 1.6%, which is the \"norm\" of the past ten years. Again, the row to hoe is a very long one here.\n\nIn the accompanying opening statement to the Monetary Policy Report's press conference, Governor Macklem served this up for us to chew on:\n\n\"If inflation continues to ease broadly in line with our forecast, it is reasonable to expect further cuts in our policy interest rate. With the target in sight and more excess supply in the economy, the downside risks are taking on increased weight in our monetary policy deliberations.\"\n\nThe Bank could not be clearer that a definitive easing bias is in place. In other words, this was an unmistakable \"dovish cut.\"\n\nWhen you think about it, all the Bank of Canada has done with these two successive rate cuts is offset the policy mistake it made a year ago when it hiked 50 basis points just as the economy entered the \"excess supply\" environment that the central bank is currently emphasizing. In fact, the Bank really should have begun cutting rates last April when it first uttered those \"excess supply\" words in its press statement -- but apparently concerns over the early-year uptick in U.S. inflation held Tiff & Company at bay.\n\nThere are two developments worth considering as to why the Bank is justified in cutting rates with the Fed dragging its heels. For one, there is no fiscal stimulus in Canada, but there is still a ton of it lingering stateside. Second, there are no 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in Canada -- the economy here resets to higher interest rates much faster than is the case in the United States. There was nothing like the US$2 trillion stimulus checks handed out in 2021 as was the case under Bidenomics -- a gift that has kept on giving to the U.S. energizer bunny consumer. And the proof of the pudding is in the eating, with the year-over-year trend in Canadian real GDP running at +0.5% compared to nearly +3.0% south of the border. And in contrast to the BoC, I doubt anyone at the Fed would be characterizing the U.S. economy as being in \"excess supply.\" That is an enormous difference that justifies the Bank's go-it-alone stance. But don't worry -- the Fed will be following this global trend towards policy rate cuts in September, once Jay Powell sets the table the month before at the Jackson Hole Symposium.\n\nCanadian household debt relative to disposable income is off the peak, but at 163%, it is far higher than the U.S. (93%). It is more than 30 percentage points above where the U.S. was in the mid-late 2000s, which was the biggest credit bubble America had ever seen. Ergo, fully 15% of after-tax income in Canada is now being siphoned into servicing the massive debt load (where it has been in the past just ahead of recessions), compared to less than 10% in the U.S.\n\nTack on the facts that Canada is in excess supply well ahead of the U.S., that the fiscal deficit ratio is one-quarter the size north of the border, that YoY real GDP growth, at +1%, is fully 2 percentage points below the U.S. trend, and, finally, that all measures of core inflation are already in the Bank's target zone, and the case for the BoC to keep easing is strong. Don't be surprised if we see the policy rate spread become as negative as -200 basis points and the Canadian dollar breaking below 70 cents in the months ahead.\n\nBottom line: The Bank of Canada is hardly done -- this is the early stage of what will prove to be more than just a partial unwind of the most severe tightening cycle since the John Crow era of the late 1980s. Bullish for the front and mid-part of the GoC curve and bearish for the Canadian dollar because the local economy is in a far weaker state than is the case south of the border, and the Bank is simply going to have to do far more than the Fed.\n\nDavid Rosenberg is founder of Rosenberg Research", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Excess supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoe_(tool)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoe (tool)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overnight rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shopping mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/5DXKY3K2GNHUDPLQBKSGGULL44.JPG?auth=ada9e0232095f409cd6653d1e6677f278ae5251bfbabfa37cf3d2f2a4a4138d4&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

That's why when you are investing for the long term, it's important to invest in assets that hedge against the effects of inflation.\n\n\"Inflation presents a complicated set of interacting factors,\" said Ben Leiser, a risk and regulatory consultant and co-author of a new Society of Actuaries report. \"A range of assets can be considered during periods of inflation that include equities, bonds and TIPs, which vary in their purpose and levels of inflation protection.\"\n\nHere's a look at why you should have these assets -- plus real estate -- in your investment portfolio to build wealth as inflation remains high.\n\nEquities, aka stocks, are historically one of the most effective long-term inflation hedges.\n\n\"The underlying companies often have the ability to increase prices for their goods and services, thereby maintaining revenue streams that can outpace inflation,\" the Society of Actuaries report stated. \"Additionally, companies may possess the flexibility to adjust their operations in response to changing economic conditions.\"\n\nEquities can be volatile over the short term, but if you are investing for the long term in a retirement fund, their returns typically outpace inflation.\n\nBonds are not typically thought of as an effective hedge against inflation, but they can be with the right strategy.\n\n\"If someone intentionally employed a strategy of purchasing short-term bonds with the expectation that interest rates would increase in response to inflation, thereby increasing the yield of the bonds,\" that could hedge against inflation, the report stated.\n\nAs the name suggests, TIPS are designed to provide protection from inflation.

See here, here, and here. We can't help it.\n\nAfter all, rents and owner equivalent rents -- a dubiously imputed measure designed to capture the cost of shelter for owner-occupiers, calculated using existing and new rents, phew! -- are helping to keep US inflation above target, providing fodder for the hawks.\n\nFTAV has also ranted about lags in various components of the inflation basket. Right now, America's sticky CPI inflation holdouts include rents, OER and car insurance.\n\nThe chart below shows how price pressures are working their way through the car insurance 'supply chain'.\n\nThe point? Can interest rates really make any difference to lagged costs just passing down the \"supply-chain\"? MainFT covered this in May.\n\nRental (and hence OER) components are still high because they partly reflect the lack of construction during the pandemic era. (New rents are falling, but since many are on long-term contracts, overall rent costs remain high.) Low housing supply remains a problem. Dearer car insurance now is also a product of past cost pressures for vehicle components.\n\nThese are supply matters, which rates can do little about. High rates could even exacerbate housing shortages by disincentivising construction.\n\nResearch by the San Francisco Fed suggests supply-driven inflation is now a more significant contributor to inflation than demand.\n\nSo, we have a situation where interest rates stay higher to target components that interest rates have little impact on, thereby squeezing down harder than necessary on rate sensitive components. That seems like a less than ideal way to conduct monetary policy.\n\nIndeed, the \"keep rates high until something breaks\" approach is common through historic cycles.\n\nA provisional July 2024 paper, entitled How should monetary policy respond to housing inflation? and written by Javier Bianchi, Alisdair McKay and Neil Malhotra at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, concurs:\n\nOur findings suggest a reappraisal of the measure of inflation targeted by central banks. The standard analysis in the New Keynesian literature finds that monetary policy should place more weight on the inflation in sectors with stickier prices because these sectors have more potential for misallocation. From our perspective, because the market for housing services is largely supply-determined, changes in prices are disconnected from the consumption of housing and are therefore less relevant for welfare.\n\nBut the logic extends beyond shelter to other sticky or lagged components. The below is from a May 2022 paper in Econometrica by Jennifer La'O and Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi:\n\nOptimal [monetary] policy stabilizes a price index with greater weights assigned to larger, stickier, and more upstream industries, as well as industries with less sticky upstream suppliers but stickier downstream customers. In a calibrated version of the model, we find that implementing the optimal policy can result in quantitatively meaningful welfare gains.\n\nThere are a few upshots:\n\n-- A rigid focus on a 2 per cent inflation target can be problematic, when the spread, direction and nature of price pressures matter as much as the total level. Central bankers need to be able to articulate that.\n\n-- At some point in every rate-tightening cycle, monetary policy can switch from being useful in tackling inflation to being potentially harmful for the economy. Other policy levers such as fiscal policy and supply-side measures (eg housebuilding) may then need to pick up the slack.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FT_Alphaville", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FT Alphaville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_San_Francisco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Econometrica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Minneapolis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Keynesian economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252F1c90ca36-df22-41a6-991c-b83146e50cc7.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

Policy Research Institute stressed on the importance of multiple measures to reduce inflation in a more tangible manner.\n\nIncreasing interest rates and encouraging the culture of savings among the population will help to siphon in money into the banks is one of the measures vital to curb inflation, the scholar noted.\n\nSelling government treasury bonds as a means of drawing out money from the economy is another alternative to reduce inflation along with increasing interest rates curb the circulation of unnecessary money, he added.\n\nThe government is taking a number of alternative measures to resolve the skyrocketing of inflation with tangible results, Brehanu further noted based on some statistical evidences.\n\nThe scholar explained that compared to the pervious year, this year's inflation on food and non-food commodities have slightly been reduced from 23 percent in May to 19.9 per cent at the current period.\n\nHe added that the efforts made in the 'Bounty of the Basket' development initiative along with other measures being taken in to enhance agricultural productivity have helped to reduce the gap between supply and demand contributing to the reduction of inflation in the food market.\n\nThe 'Bounty of the Basket' is a development program initiated by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to increase the productivity of milk, poultry and meat production.\n\nThe efforts made by consumer cooperatives in the country in supplying food items with more reasonable prices was also instrumental in helping to reduce inflation in the sector, the scholar further remarked.\n\nMinister of Trade and Regional Integration, Kassahun Goffe for his part stated that efforts made in the country to further increase production and productivity has made commendable contributions in reducing inflation.Dry season irrigations schemes for wheat production launched by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed along with various development endeavors including the 'Bounty of the Basket' has been instrumental in bringing the desired results in reducing inflation.\n\nThe minister further affirmed the commitment of the government to curb the economic challenges of inflation to a lower level.\n\nLocal consumer associations have been contributing a lot to reduce the exiting inflation by supplying agricultural and industrial products to the consumers.", "source": {"uri":

The main reasons for this are that prices (and thus price changes) differ from place to place and that households do not all buy the same products. Households adjust their purchases over time, but not enough to offset these differences.\n\nThe differences between households in terms of their exposure to inflation have gained a lot of attention, especially since the recent jump in the cost of living. Their different inflation experiences feed into different inflation perceptions and expectations (D'Acunto et al. 2021; Weber et al. 2022). In turn, this can mean that households seemingly react differently to aggregate inflation. Moreover, systematic inflation differences among households can have distributional effects. For example, because poorer households spend a larger share of their income on food, an increase in food prices reduces their purchasing power relatively more.\n\nThis article describes the nature and sources of inflation differences for purchases of supermarket goods across a large panel of French and German households. It documents a large and persistent dispersion of inflation rates across households. \"Inflation\" is the aggregate outcome of many price changes in the same direction. The inflation dispersion stems primarily from two sources. First, the price changes of a given product differ across regions and, second, individual households choose different products within a product category.\n\nEven when households buy the same product, typically the time and place of their purchases differ and potentially also their use of rebate offers. As a result, in any given quarter households may pay very different prices for the same product and thus experience different price changes relative to earlier quarters. To examine how these differences in purchasing behaviour translate into inflation differences, we calculate household-level inflation rates. We do so using both household-specific prices and prices averaged across households residing in a given region. Averaging prices over larger and larger regions removes first the effect of household-specific price differences and subsequently also the effect of local price differences.\n\nChart 1 shows the distribution of household-level inflation rates based on (actual) household-level prices and (counterfactual) regional prices. In both France and Germany, the dispersion of household-level inflation rates based on average prices of products in smaller regions (three-digit and two-digit postal areas plotted as orange and yellow lines respectively) is very close to the dispersion based on household-level prices (red lines). In other words, differences in prices paid by specific households, which capture, among other things, use of money-saving coupons, efforts made to search out cheaper prices, and personalised offers (all for a given product), play a largely negligible role in explaining differences in inflation.\n\nAveraging prices within larger regions results in a small compression of the distribution (blue lines). It is only when averaging for the whole country that there is a large reduction in the inflation dispersion (grey lines). The chart illustrates that differences in prices paid for the same product within a country play an important role for inflation differences. However, these price differences are mostly due to differences between larger regional units (e.g. Greater Paris vs. rural regions) rather than between individual households within a given region.\n\nChart 2, which provides a breakdown of the inflation variation across households, illustrates this. The contribution to the total variance made by the household-specific component amounts to only about 3% in France and 7% in Germany, while the regional component contributes almost 40% in both countries.\n\nIn the short run households cannot easily switch regions to evade regional inflation differences. The main way they can adjust the inflation they experience is by their product choices. These choices differ considerably across households: the choice of which product to buy within a given brand and the choice between brands with a given quality level explain about 50% of the inflation dispersion in France and about 30% in Germany. The differences in the allocation of consumption across product categories (e.g. food vs. energy) are an important driver only in Germany, where they account for more than 20% of the total inflation variance. In the United States, by comparison, the price differences across both households and regions appear to play a more central role in the inflation dispersion than in our sample (Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl, 2017).\n\nCan the differences in household-level inflation rates be traced to differences in households' behaviour or in their demographics? More than 80% of the overall variance of household-level inflation rates is due to changes over time within the households themselves, most of which are not captured by the observed household characteristics. Indeed, observed time-varying household characteristics explain less than 5% of the variation across households. Among these, the behavioural variables (such as brand choice, shopping channels, and time and effort invested in shopping) explain more than two-thirds of this systematic variation in household-level inflation rates, while demographic variables (such as household size and income) explain only a little. Income differences, for example, are not in themselves a first-order determinant of inflation differences. Nevertheless, the correlation between household income and behaviour results in significant and time-varying inflation differences between income groups.\n\nHouseholds can offset some of the price inflation of products they normally purchase by switching to products that experience a relatively lower inflation rate. While they do indeed do so on average, they often switch to products that show a relatively higher inflation rate, i.e. products that are getting relatively more expensive. This counterintuitive pattern is not only seen for inflation rates calculated with household-level prices, but also for rates calculated with prices averaged at the product level.\n\nMost commonly used inflation indices track the price of a fixed shopping basket, that is, of a set of goods that is held constant over short horizons. Such cost of goods indices do not take account of the ability of households to continuously switch between products. An alternative approach measures the change in expenditure required to maintain a constant level of utility. Measuring inflation by a cost of living index with constant preferences (blue line in Chart 3) instead of a cost of goods index with a fixed basket of goods (red line in Chart 3) returns very similar inflation dispersion estimates. Specifically, the effect of switching to products that are getting relatively cheaper and the effect of differing preferences largely offset each other. Allowing for changes in preferences over time, however, increases the estimated difference between households in the 25th versus the 75th percentile by more than 40% (dark green line in Chart 3). At the household level, differing preferences across goods and over time are thus separate components of inflation differences.\n\nOverall, the substitution of one product for another is strongly driven by household behaviour and has little to do with relative price changes, therefore, it barely reduces the dispersion of inflation rates.\n\nDuring the recent inflation spike, inflation rates differed widely between socioeconomic groups, especially with respect to energy and other non-food inflation components (Soldani et al. 2023). Large inflation rate differences are not only seen in times of high inflation, however, and abound even within food inflation components. Households differ widely in terms of their shopping behaviour, product choice and consumption basket and therefore end up experiencing very different inflation rates for supermarket goods - even within seemingly narrowly defined social groups, such as a given low-income group. Assumptions such as common real interest rates or common inflation expectations might thus be rather imperfect descriptions of reality.\n\nD'Acunto, F., Malmendier, U., Ospina, J. and Weber, M.

The inflation was increasing sharply, started stagnation now and it is expected to start falling. When I said falling it is not significant. From 34.19 to about 32 percent towards the end of the year to about 28 percent.\n\n\"One of the major stocking factors is logistic cost. It is a good thing that Alhaji Aliko Dangote has come to the rescue. Another thing, now it is a law, N70,000 is the new Minimum wage.\n\n\"What does all of this mean to the ordinary man?\n\n\"What we are seeing is that prices of food commodities will drop or are expected to drop if nobody corners it. Rice for example, the current price is N82,000 and will come down to N70,000 by September, Wheat from N59,000 to N50,000, and Beans from N150,000 to N110,000.\n\n\"Food import duty waiver will tamper inflation. Dangote Refinery Fuel product will come on August 15th, it will guarantee supply not price.\n\n\"The new Minimum wage will impact inflation only marginally. High interest rates will help increase savings. The Naira will recover from N1,700 per dollar to N1500 in September\", he said.\n\nRecall that the CBN on Tuesday hiked inflation by 50 basis points to 26.75 percent amid efforts to tackle rising core inflation and food inflation which stood at 34.19 percent and 40.87 percent in June 2024.\n\nThis development comes after President Bola Ahmed Tinubu government announced plans to suspend import duty on foods for 150 days.", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ogaga_ariemu@dailypost.ng", "name": "Ogaga Ariemu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_Refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dangote Refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliko_Dangote", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliko Dangote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bodija-market.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1683, "textEnd": 1694}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"The best way to boost the economy and give people stuck with sky-high mortgage rates some relief is for the Bank of Canada to cut interest rates again tomorrow. They need to get this done,\" the premier said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFord's latest intervention comes as the Bank of Canada is widely expected to lower its key overnight lending rate for the second consecutive time Wednesday as the economy appears to be slowing.\n\nAnalysts believe the central bank will cut the rate to 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per cent.\n\nBut the premier, who has been publicly lobbying Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem for months to slash the cost of borrowing, said rates must be even lower to jump-start housing construction.\n\n\"I can't help myself with this but the Bank of Canada, they need to continue cutting these rates,\" Ford told reporters Monday in Kitchener.\n\nBlasting the bank as an \"antiquated group ... living back in the 1970s,\" the premier said drastic action must be taken.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Folks, you want to build homes? We get the Bank of Canada to knock the interest rate down to about three per cent, you'll see them pop up like mushrooms everywhere,\" he said.\n\nThat would lead to developers borrowing additional money to build homes and more buyers getting mortgages to afford them, said Ford.\n\nPrior to last month's cut, the Bank of Canada raised rates 10 times -- from 0.25 per cent in March 2022 to five per cent in July 2023.\n\n\"I encourage the governor of the Bank of Canada (to) get his act together and start lowering interest rates at a lot faster pace -- just like you did when you raised the interest rates 10 times (at a) record speed,\" the premier said.\n\n\"It's easy to raise things but we need to start moving on that,\" he said.\n\nThe bank's rationale for increasing rates was to slow the economy to reduce inflation -- because making it more expensive to borrow leads to less spending, driving down prices.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation skyrocketed to 8.1 per cent in June 2022, well above the central bank's target of two per cent.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, inflation was at 2.7 per cent last month, down from 2.9 per cent in April.\n\nBecause Ford is pondering an early election next spring -- one year ahead of the scheduled June 2026 vote -- he is under pressure to demonstrate some success in tackling Ontario's housing crisis.\n\nBut his goal to build 1.5-million new homes by 2031 appears to be falling short with annual housing starts far below the average levels needed to achieve that.\n\nThe $8.28-billion Greenbelt land swap scandal, which is now under investigation by the RCMP, has also hindered the province's efforts to get more homes built.", "source": {"uri":

The pressure on households is also dependent on the SARB and its policy moves on interest rates.\n\nThe latest inflation data for June, published by Stats SA on Wednesday (24 July), shows that inflation is still taking its time in easing, only declining by a paltry 0.1 percentage points to 5.1% in the month (from 5.2%) before\n\nMore positively, interest rates are now expected to start coming down in September. This will provide some relief to consumers, and more disposable income in their pockets.\n\nAt its latest meeting, the SARB's Monetary Policy Committee was more bullish on the wider economy, with two members of the MPC voting to cut rates by 25 basis points in July.\n\nHowever, Reserve Bank governor Lesetja Kganyago warned that the fight against inflation was far from over, with the prevailing headline rate still not at the mid-point of the bank's target range (4.5%), which he only expects to achieve by mid-2025.\n\nHouseholds feeling the pinch\n\nAccording to consultancy group PwC, it currently has one of the more bearish views on salaries, projecting a 0.4% decline in real terms for 2024 and a marginal 0.1% boost in 2025.\n\nCommenting on its latest Voice of the Consumer Survey 2024, the group flagged inflation, low economic growth and unemployment as the three biggest potential threats to consumers and the country, according to respondents.\n\nLullu Krugel, PwC South Africa Chief Economist, noted that concerns about the cost of living are frequently identified by South Africans as something that keeps them up at night.\n\n\"The combination of elevated inflation and accompanying high interest rates at present is placing pressure on household budgets,\" she said.\n\nThe survey asked South Africans about their spending intentions in the coming six months and how they expect their expenditure on specific product categories to change.\n\nA key finding was that, on average, 60% of respondents expect to spend more on essentials, while only 42% expect to spend more on comfort and/or luxury goods.\n\nEssential goods include groceries, clothing and footwear - items which represent the most basic of human requirements.\n\nAccording to PwC, households in South Africa spend a combined 20% of their money on food, non alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear.\n\nHowever, this number ranges from almost 60% in households with the lowest income levels (up to R20,000 per annum) and just over 13% in the highest income households (more than R300,000 per annum).", "source": {"uri": "businesstech.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessTech"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_versus_nominal_value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real versus nominal value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disposable and discretionary income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargaining_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bargaining power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Reserve_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South African Reserve Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BankservAfrica", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BankservAfrica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PwC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PwC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholic drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Household"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwear", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Footwear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luxury goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesetja_Kganyago", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lesetja Kganyago"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Broke-money-poor-middle-class-pain-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754183", "eventUri": "eng-9754183", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 2050, "textEnd": 2057}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

For the past two years, TurkStat has not disclosed the individual prices of items used to calculate inflation, defying court rulings that mandated such disclosures. Critics argue that the institution underreports inflation figures to enable the government to minimize pension and wage adjustments, which are indexed to these figures.\n\nIn June, TurkStat reported a six-month inflation rate of 24.75%, which set the basis for mid-year pension adjustments. Opposition parties, including the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Peoples' Democracy and Equality (DEM) Party, have filed separate criminal complaints against TurkStat, accusing it of deliberately underreporting inflation to facilitate lower wage increases.\n\nBoth parties have pressed the charge of \"concealing data and abusing public duty\" against the statistical authority. In its petition to the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, DEM Party stated, \"The rates of increases in civil servant and pensioner salaries are determined based on the inflation rates announced by TurkStat. With the inflation data released in June, both the rate of rent increases and the six-month inflation difference reflected in the salaries of civil servants and pensioners were determined accordingly.\n\n\"TurkStat's data negatively impacts the lives of millions of people who live by their labor. By publishing data that causes millions of people to become poorer under inflation conditions, in order not to trouble the political power, TurkStat is clearly committing a crime.\n\n\"The unpublished item-level prices and misleadingly determined so-called inflation figures also constitute the crime of openly spreading misleading information to the public. The institution's president and executives are abusing their duties and committing a crime by openly spreading misleading information to the public.\"\n\nWhile TurkStat has been accused of manipulating data, particularly of inflation and unemployment, this latest controversy was ignited by a leak of the concealed data to the press in early July. The 2023 figures published by Alaattin Akta\u015f, a columnist for the Ekonomim news portal, revealed that the prices TurkStat used in its calculations were significantly lower than market prices.\n\nFor example, the average price for an egg was calculated as 2 Turkish liras last year, and the average fee for a doctor's appointment was 34 liras, much lower than actual prices. In another peculiarity, the statistical agency reported that the price of olive oil was lower than the price of olives, despite multiple kilograms of olives being required to produce one liter of olive oil.\n\nFollowing the backlash caused by the leak, TurkStat President Erhan \u00c7etinkaya held a lengthy press conference on July 9 to defend the institution's practices. According to him, the reason for not disclosing individual items' prices was that it would delay the announcement of the inflation rate by one day, which has not been found convincing by the public.\n\n\u00c7etinkaya further emphasized that the inflation calculations follow international standards and that perceived inflation often differs from official figures, a common phenomenon worldwide.\n\nDespite these defenses, public trust in TurkStat remains low. According to a 2022 survey by MetroPoll, 61.7% of the public believe TurkStat underreports inflation. This skepticism is further fueled by discrepancies between TurkStat's figures and those of independent groups like the Inflation Research Group (ENAG), which reported much higher inflation rates.

For inflation, those data are practically in line with our projections. However, there was some worsening in the data for economic growth, owing mainly to the political uncertainty following the European and French elections. That said, we decided to keep interest rates unchanged because we will have more information in September, and especially new macroeconomic projections, so we will be able to better reassess the monetary policy stance. Data-wise, September is a much more convenient month for taking decisions than July was.\n\nWhen you talk about increasing confidence, aren't you at the same time saying that you are not yet confident?\n\nThe current level of uncertainty is huge, so we have to be prudent when taking decisions. When we say that we want to have more confidence, we mean more confidence that at the end of 2025 inflation will be at our definition of price stability, which is an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term. That's the key question.\n\nIn the meantime, we will continue to receive new data, such as wage developments, which we look at particularly closely owing to their potential impact on services inflation. Services inflation is at 4.1%, and it is currently the component of inflation that is proving more difficult to bring down. But most of all, we will have new macroeconomic projections in September, and it will be crucial to see in those projections that inflation is steadily converging towards 2% over the medium term.\n\nDo you need all the data, and especially wage data, to be moving in the right direction to gain that confidence?\n\nWage data are important, but we receive them with a time lag. In September we will have another two months of data on inflation and underlying inflation, but the new macroeconomic projections will be the most important. They are produced on the basis of the previous projections and include data such as the price of oil, exchange rate developments and changes in financing conditions. All of these data are added to the pot every three months to update our projections, which are obviously a crucial part of our future decisions.\n\nAlthough the inflation rate in June was 0.1 percentage points lower than in May, services inflation and the underlying rate have stayed at more or less the same levels for months.\n\nAs we have already said, inflation will be around current levels until the end of the year. At the same time, all measures of underlying inflation are coming down, therefore the disinflation process will continue from the start of next year. We are already seeing that wages are starting to slow down. Our surveys show that firms expect wage increases to moderate, especially as of 2025, because the current rise in wages is closely related to regaining purchasing power as a result of past inflation. And if wage increases moderate, services inflation - which is most sensitive to wage developments - will moderate too, and that will enable us to reach our 2% inflation target at the end of next year.\n\nThe latest bank lending survey showed that demand for mortgages increased for the first time since 2022. What does that mean?\n\nFinancing conditions in the second quarter were broadly unchanged compared with the first quarter, although there are some specific changes. For example, we are starting to see an increase in demand for consumer credit and an improvement in demand for mortgages. But they are still very small changes.\n\nWhat's most important is that we have had several quarters during which financing conditions and loan demand have not deteriorated further. Our previous reports showed continued tightening throughout 2022 and much of 2023, coinciding with the rise in interest rates, then we saw some stabilisation at the end of 2023 which has continued this year. The tightening of financing conditions peaked almost three quarters ago, and banks are now expecting financing conditions to ease.\n\nHow might the complex geopolitical environment affect your decisions?\n\nPolitical uncertainty in Europe has risen in the aftermath of the European elections. The European Parliament has now re-elected Ursula von der Leyen, which in my view is a confidence indicator as regards stability. But we will have to see what the composition of the new European Commission is.\n\nIn France, the outcome of the elections was a parliament with no majority, which may make it difficult to form a government. This has created additional uncertainty and has affected the French economy, which is the second largest in the euro area.\n\nOverall, the uncertainty leads to much more cautious and prudent decision-making, because everything is much less clear. And when you're in a dark room and can't see, you try to move more slowly so that you don't break anything.\n\nIn the case of France, with its fiscal situation, is there concern about the stance of the new Government?\n\nWithout getting into the specific situation of any one country, what is important is that the new fiscal rules are applied. In September countries have to present their medium-term multi-annual plans, and in October they will have to present their budget plans for 2025. It's very important that all countries respect and implement the fiscal framework we have given ourselves in Europe. It would be very bad if the fiscal rules were not respected, which were only approved six months ago. I hope it will be the case that all countries respect the new fiscal framework.\n\nThe Spanish Government has revised its forecasts upwards. How does the situation look to you?\n\nThe Spanish economy is experiencing above-average growth. It is expected to grow by around 2.5% [of GDP] this year, well above the projection for the euro area as a whole. This growth is driven by a boost in public consumption and a significant population increase. The population has grown by more than one million people in the last two years. And these people have entered the labour market, driving this economic growth.\n\nHowever, with regard to future growth, it's very important that competitiveness remains the foundation of growth in the economy. For this to happen, it's crucial that productivity improves and that wage growth remains consistent with productivity so Spanish firms can continue to compete internationally. And this is what has been happening since Spain first achieved a surplus in the current account of the balance of payments more than ten years ago. Likewise, to ensure the economy remains on a competitive path it's crucial that companies are not burdened with additional costs or uncertainty.\n\nAnd the situation of Spanish banks...\n\nSpain has a sound financial system that is able to provide credit in a resilient way. This is another pillar of the Spanish economy.\n\nAre they prepared for a change in monetary policy and ready to compete for deposits when the ECB is withdrawing liquidity?\n\nThe improvement in the profitability of European and Spanish banks has reached a ceiling. We will see how it begins to decrease because the favourable factors, like rate increases, will fall away.\n\nThe lack of remuneration on deposits in Spain has mainly been caused by excess liquidity in the banking system, liquidity which the ECB is now gradually withdrawing. Previously the banks didn't need to compete for liquidity, but this withdrawal means they will increasingly have to compete to attract deposits. At the same time, on the assets side we have indeed seen greater competition between banks in the area of mortgage and consumer loan offerings.\n\nWhen will the ECB take a decision on BBVA's takeover of Sabadell?\n\nWe have around two months since the takeover bid is communicated to the ECB, so it won't take much longer. The decision will be based on solvency and prudential criteria and will be communicated to the entity.\n\nWhy are there no cross-border transactions?\n\nWe would like to see more cross-border transactions because we want to have a single banking market, and for that we need banks that operate across the entire euro area. The lack of cross-border transactions is fundamentally linked to the fact that the banking union is incomplete, even if there is a single supervisor. We don't have a common deposit insurance scheme, for example. And it is also linked to differences in regulation and in national legislation, which make cross-border transactions much more complex than national transactions.\n\nAre you confident that the new European Commission will make progress towards the banking union? What can you do? Are you optimistic?\n\nFor the ECB, completing the banking union is a top priority. The ECB is not the EU legislator, so what we can do is give our clear opinion about completing the banking union and the capital markets union, and also about the need for an agreement to create a single fiscal capacity in Europe. These three elements are necessary to complete the governance of Economic and Monetary Union.\n\nIs the situation at Banco de Espa\u00f1a being discussed within the ECB?\n\nThe Deputy Governor of the Banco de Espa\u00f1a, Margarita Delgado, attended last Thursday's meeting and actively contributed to the discussions as any other member of the Governing Council. But not having an officially appointed Governor is unusual, so we hope an appointment will be made by 10 September. Our general recommendation is that appointees should have experience in monetary or banking matters.\n\nIs it an issue if someone moves from being a minister to being Governor of the central bank?\n\nIn Spain, appointing the central bank Governor is the prerogative of the Government. There is an implicit agreement that the party in power appoints the Governor and the main opposition party nominates the Deputy Governor. Personally, I think it's important to respect such agreements as they are part of a country's institutional architecture.\n\nI was a minister and then became Vice-President of the ECB as part of the Executive Board. But the situation wasn't the same, because the process for appointing members of the Executive Board and its functions are different. The Spanish Government nominated me as a candidate, but the decision was taken by the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, after consulting the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the ECB. So there were different bodies that took the decision. And by definition, the functions of the Executive Board concern the entire euro area. However, many central banks fulfil tasks at the national level. For example, the Banco de Espa\u00f1a has to advise the Government and produce appropriate reports and research on the economic situation and the economic policy of the Government with independence of

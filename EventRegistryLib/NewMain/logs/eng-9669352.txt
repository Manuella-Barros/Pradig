Certainly it seems that the federal government doesn't care what Surrey thinks, likely seeing us as a small fish in a big pond full of voters. The 'rule of law' banner hoisted above Canada on the world stage seems to have been set aside in our policing situation.\n\nThe NDP government's decision to force the SPS on the citizens of Surrey is disrespectful to everyone involved: to the voters who are expected to pay for it, to their duly-elected mayor, to the RCMP, and even to the SPS, who are told they will soon be the POJ in Surrey, a decision not based on merit, and when there are indications that they are simply not wanted. They are seen by some people as being puppets in a political figure's self-important scheme to make a name for himself.\n\nThe resentment towards the NDP festering in many people in Surrey could have been avoided by letting the voters have their say through a binding referendum on the matter right from the start.

Any transition should have a thorough feasibility study at the beginning stages. Surrey did none of that, he noted.\n\n\"It's an example of what not to do,\" said Mr. Sauv\u00e9.\n\nLast week, Surrey Mayor Brenda Locke indicated in a statement she read out that council would end its battle with the province to keep the RCMP as the force for the city of just over half a million people.\n\nSurrey's transition to a new municipal police force began under former mayor Doug McCallum, but Ms. Locke unseated him in the 2022 election while running on a platform to keep the RCMP. Ms. Locke has long argued the switch would be too costly to municipal taxpayers. The provincial government stepped in last year to order the change, prompting a lawsuit from Surrey, which the city lost.\n\n\"I accept the decision and we are moving forward with what the city needs to do to make sure our residents are prioritized,\" Ms. Locke said.\n\nMr. Sauv\u00e9 said his union has accepted that the fight is over, but now it's time to figure out the best process for completing the transition to the municipal service\n\nHow it all gets paid for is still unclear.\n\nMs. Locke told council she believes \"this NDP-imposed transition\" will not serve Surrey taxpayers, noting once again that public reports have estimated the new force could cost between $32-million and $75-million a year more than the cost of the RCMP.\n\nThe B.C. government pledged to provide $150-million over five years to cover increased costs and included an assurance that if Surrey Police Service officers were more expensive than RCMP officers in 2029, the province would cover the difference until 2034 up to $20-million. Surrey rejected the offer, but the province has said it would use the $150-million to support the transition anyway.\n\nBut the city's 2024 budget limits any new money to the Surrey Police Service to only the officers and staff who had been hired up to last fall. There was no provision in that budget, passed in late April, to provide additional money to hire the additional hundreds of officers and staff still needed to bring the force up to the full 734 officers authorized for the city.\n\nMs. Locke said the city manager has created a team of experts to monitor the progress being made and to request that the province provide clarity on what the actual additional costs will be.\n\nSurrey Police Board administrator Mike Serr, the former Abbotsford police chief who was appointed by the province last September to temporarily replace the board, had put forward a budget of $141.5-million for 2024. But Surrey council passed a budget that provided for only $48.8-million for the force, something that Mr. Serr has asked the province's director of policing services to review.\n\nBecause of the city's budget decision, the province has been paying directly for new hires, who, for the moment, cannot be included in the human-resources system the city has in place for the rest of its police officers, both RCMP and SPS.\n\nCurt Griffiths, a Simon Fraser University professor who is a policing expert and consultant to the province, said the B.C. government may have to step in to redo the city's budget.\n\nHe said Ms. Locke \"needs to carry out the role of mayor, get out of the way and stop being obstructive. Her delaying tactics have been very costly.\"\n\nThe SPS and Solicitor-General Mike Farnworth have been circumspect with their statements since Ms. Locke spoke to council last week as all sides make tentative arrangements to figure out a new process.\n\nMr. Sauv\u00e9 said that process will need to be clear before Nov. 29, the date the SPS officially takes over.\n\nHe said RCMP officers who have been waiting, some of them up to two years, to plan their move out of Surrey need to know when those transfers might finally come through.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Locke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_McCallum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug McCallum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Locke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brenda Locke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Police (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surrey, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Farnworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Farnworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_for_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General for England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Serbia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Party of Serbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Fraser_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simon Fraser University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrey Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbotsford,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbotsford, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abbotsford, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Urban_Transport", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Urban Transport", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/M4F6BGNA5JPD7DPE446VEC2FVE.JPG?auth=1ac2da7e76fe46aed8e95427b308d60dcda8a9fdddca23e6323c234c2df4a5ec&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669352", "eventUri": "eng-9669352", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-29", "textStart": 4015, "textEnd": 4022}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Not happening,\" she's quoted in a news release sent Thursday, June 20.\n\nHepner was a single-term mayor of Surrey from 2014 to 2018, when she left civic politics.\n\nShe'll be among what the Conversatives promise to be \"a full slate\" of 93 candidates when B.C. votes go to the polls in October.\n\n\"John Rustad and his Conversative team have been relentless in their opposition to Eby's radical policies,\" Hepner charged.\n\n\"Conservatives are the opposition. The Conversatives have put together a strong team to defeat Eby's NDP, including business leaders, lawyers, addictions doctors and small business owners. I'm proud to be joining the only alternative to the NDP, to fight for Surrey.\"\n\nCovering parts of Fleetwood and Cloverdale, the new Surrey- Serpentine River riding was created under the 2021 B.C. electoral redistribution.

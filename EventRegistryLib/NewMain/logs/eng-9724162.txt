Officials talk to vulnerable people, install air conditioning units early and essentially figure out what to do when things get nasty and practice at it. The Miami-Dade government and the local National Weather Service office team up to treat heat like something more scary, but often less deadly.\n\nWhen Jane Gilbert took over three years ago as the county's heat officer, one of the first in an increasingly warmer nation, she said Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told her \"I want you to prepare our people on the level that we do our hurricane season.\"\n\nBecause Miami averages a hurricane landfall nearby every six years or so, according to the National Hurricane Center, getting ready for storm season is a big and quite public deal with media, stores and government all talking about preparations.\n\nWhen it comes to heat, the county first determined who was vulnerable and where they were, Gilbert said.\n\n\"We looked at emergency department visits and hospitalizations by zip code and there are some zip codes that have four or five times the rates of others,\" Gilbert said. Because of the urban heat island effect, poverty rates, amount of asphalt and greenery, some places can be more than 10 degrees hotter than measured temperatures, she said. Those zip codes tend have higher percentages of families with children.\n\nWhile Miami has a high rate of air conditioning in homes, it's expensive and many poor people can't afford it or have inefficient units so they don't use them as often as needed, Gilbert said. Before last year's heat season started, the county installed 1,700 efficient air conditioning units \"to make sure everyone under the county's care had access to efficient cooling,\" she said.\n\nWith the designation of a heat season starting May 31, officials now prepare for three different weather hazards from May to October: heat, hurricanes and floods.\n\n\"We're calling them trifecta trainings,\" Gilbert said. Volunteers go to homeless encampments, summer camps, health care clinics and vulnerable neighborhoods to talk with people, organizers, doctors and others about what to do when the high heat kicks in, what danger signs to look for. This year, Miami has 14 different trainings in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole.\n\nThe county provides cooling towels to homeless, helps coordinate water donations, hands out maps of where cooling sites are and even offers transportation when the heat gets really bad.\n\nAlso, the county and the local weather service office changed the thresholds for when heat advisories and warnings kick in and communication to the public ramps up, said National Weather Service meteorologist Sammy Hadi. Before last year, the feels-like heat index, which combines temperature and humidity, had to reach 113 degrees to be a heat warning that activates more county resources and action. That had never happened in Miami before, he said.\n\nLast year, due to community wishes and scientific data, the weather service dropped that heat warning threshold to 110 degrees. Miami-Dade got its first heat warning. In fact, the county had a heat warning on seven days last year, Hadi said.\n\nThe lower heat advisory used to be only triggered at 108 degrees, but now gets declared at 105 degrees. Last year, Miami-Dade had a record 38 days under that heat advisory.\n\nThe experiment in lower heat thresholds in Miami worked so well that neighboring suburban Broward County joined Dade, Hadi said. So far this year, South Florida has had 13 days of heat advisories, he said.\n\nPeople in vulnerable communities should know what to do, because the county has targeted those zip codes with digital ads at gas stations, grocery stores, bus shelters and billboards, Gilbert said.\n\nWhile Maricopa County in Arizona had at least 645 deaths where heat was a factor in 2023 and Texas had 450 and Nevada had 226, the official heat-related death count for Miami-Dade was so low -- 10 or fewer -- that it didn't register with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts say heat deaths are widely underreported because it is a factor that triggers other more direct causes and often doctors and medical examiners don't think to see if temperature played a role.\n\nGilbert is quick to say it's unfair to compare Phoenix's high death count to South Florida's minimal one because the Arizona city has made it a priority to make sure heat-related deaths are recorded that way, where other cities, including Miami, don't. The way Miami tracks heat deaths is not nearly as comprehensive, she said. Also, Phoenix has more homeless who are more vulnerable because they don't escape the heat indoors, she said.\n\nAnd it was hot.\n\n\"Completely unprecedented. It was like an entirely different climate regime,\" said University of Miami tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy who was tracking the warmth daily. \"The number of records we broke and the margins we broke them by was unimaginable... In the four months from mid-June to mid-October, the heat index record was broken 40% of the days.\"\n\nThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity, hit 105 degrees or above on 40 days from June 1 to September 1 last year with the city sweltering for 108 hours of that level of \"particularly oppressive\" conditions, according to the National Weather Service. The summer warm season was the hottest on record.\n\nBut heat has become a political issue.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis in April signed a bill that bars county and city governments from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers. It was a direct response to Miami-Dade County's effort to require shade and water for construction, farm and other outdoor workers.\n\nStill, several experts -- doctors, public health officials and meteorologists -- point to Miami, along with Phoenix and Houston, as model cities for dealing with worsening heat waves and higher death tolls triggered by human-caused climate change.\n\n\"Miami's kind of a poster child because they have a chief heat officer to begin with, so they're already ahead of the curve,\" said Morgan Zabow, community heath and health coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Jane Gilbert with Miami-Dade County is just a rock star to begin with. And there, she's implementing so many different things across the county.\"\n\n___\n\nTerry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Mary Katherine Wildeman in Hartford, Conn. contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Last year, Miami-Dade had a record 38 days under that heat advisory.\n\nThe experiment in lower heat thresholds in Miami worked so well that neighboring suburban Broward County joined Dade, Hadi said. So far this year, South Florida has had 13 days of heat advisories, he said.\n\nPeople in vulnerable communities should know what to do, because the county has targeted those zip codes with digital ads at gas stations, grocery stores, bus shelters and billboards, Gilbert said.\n\n\"Getting the word out is half the battle,\" Hadi said.\n\nIt seems to work.\n\nWhile Maricopa County in Arizona had at least 645 deaths where heat was a factor in 2023 and Texas had 450 and Nevada had 226, the official heat-related death count for Miami-Dade was so low -- 10 or fewer -- that it didn't register with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts say heat deaths are widely underreported because it is a factor that triggers other more direct causes and often doctors and medical examiners don't think to see if temperature played a role.\n\nGilbert is quick to say it's unfair to compare Phoenix's high death count to South Florida's minimal one because the Arizona city has made it a priority to make sure heat-related deaths are recorded that way, where other cities, including Miami, don't. The way Miami tracks heat deaths is not nearly as comprehensive, she said. Also, Phoenix has more homeless who are more vulnerable because they don't escape the heat indoors, she said.\n\nAnd it was hot.\n\n\"Completely unprecedented. It was like an entirely different climate regime,\" said University of Miami tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy who was tracking the warmth daily. \"The number of records we broke and the margins we broke them by was unimaginable... In the four months from mid-June to mid-October, the heat index record was broken 40% of the days.\"\n\nThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity, hit 105 degrees or above on 40 days from June 1 to September 1 last year with the city sweltering for 108 hours of that level of \"particularly oppressive\" conditions, according to the National Weather Service. The summer warm season was the hottest on record.\n\nBut heat has become a political issue.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis in April signed a bill that bars county and city governments from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers. It was a direct response to Miami-Dade County's effort to require shade and water for construction, farm and other outdoor workers.\n\nStill, several experts -- doctors, public health officials and meteorologists -- point to Miami, along with Phoenix and Houston, as model cities for dealing with worsening heat waves and higher death tolls triggered by human-caused climate change.\n\n\"Miami's kind of a poster child because they have a chief heat officer to begin with, so they're already ahead of the curve,\" said Morgan Zabow, community heath and health coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Jane Gilbert with Miami-Dade County is just a rock star to begin with. And there, she's implementing so many different things across the county.\"\n\nTerry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Mary Katherine Wildeman in Hartford, Conn. contributed to this report.\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on X at @borenbears\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

High temperatures will reach into the high 80s, with the heat index expected to reach the 90s. The current City of Boston heat advisory threshold is 3 days or more of 90 degrees heat index, sustained for 2 or more hours per day.\n\n\"City staff are working to ensure Boston has an enjoyable and safe summer, and we're asking residents to do their part to protect themselves from hot and humid weather,\" said Mayor Michelle Wu. \"While this is not a heat emergency, we are advising people to take the necessary precautions such as taking breaks when working outside, staying hydrated, and checking on each other in the heat.\"\n\n\"The Office of Emergency Management is coordinating closely with the National Weather Service (NWS) and Boston Public Health Commission on the weather and its impacts to our constituents. We are in communication with our partners, particularly those that work directly with vulnerable populations, to ensure they have what they need and will be available to support any resource or coordination needs that may arise,\" said Chief of Emergency Preparedness Adrian Jordan. \"We want to remind residents that extreme heat can be dangerous. Sustained periods of high heat increases the risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses, especially for children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions.\"\n\nThe City of Boston is taking critical immediate action to provide heat relief, including short-term, actionable steps toward relief during heat waves. The City of Boston has been engaging in a variety of projects to support extreme heat mitigation and improved health for residents. Anyone, regardless of their medical conditions, can feel the impacts of extreme heat. During a heat wave, Boston Emergency Medical Services typically experience an 10-15% increase in calls to 9-1-1 for people of all ages.\n\nSplash pads will be open at parks and playgrounds throughout the City. Several city pools are open for people to cool off and operating hours can be found at boston.gov/pools. Memberships to all City pools are free. Learn more about how to create a membership and register for a swim session at Boston.gov/BCYF-registration. Because of a collaboration between Boston Public Schools, Boston Centers for Youth & Families, the Public Facilities Department, and the Property Management Department, investments of City funding, and improved facilities assessment, the City is on track to have more pools open this year than in previous summers. The BCYF Mildred pool opens tomorrow and the BCYF Perkins pool opened just yesterday.\n\nBoston Public Library locations are also available for residents to seek relief from the heat. Patrons are always welcome to participate in BPL's summer programming for kids, teens, and adults.\n\nInformation on heat safety tips can be found online at boston.gov/heat and by following @CityofBoston on Twitter. Residents can sign up for AlertBoston, the City's emergency notification system, to receive emergency alerts by phone, email, or text. Sign up online here. Residents are also encouraged to call 311 with any questions about available City services.\n\nThe Mayor issued the following heat safety tips:\n\n* Children and pets should never be left alone in vehicles, even for short periods of time.\n\n* Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids regardless of activity level. Avoid alcoholic beverages and liquids high in sugar or caffeine.\n\n* Keep cool with frequent cool showers, shade, and air conditioning or fans.\n\n* Limit outdoor activity to morning and evening hours. Rest often in shady areas and be extra cautious from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., when the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation is strongest.\n\n* Know the signs of heat exhaustion. Heavy sweating, cool and clammy skin, dizziness, nausea, and muscle aches could all be signs of heat exhaustion. If symptoms persist, call 9-1-1 immediately. Do not delay care. Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S. and can exacerbate underlying illnesses.\n\n* Adults and children should use sunscreen containing an SPF-30 or higher and wear protective, loose-fitting clothing including long sleeve shirts and hats.\n\n* If you have a child in your home, use child window guards in addition to screens on any open window on the second story or above. Falls are the leading cause of injury for children under the age of six.\n\n* Secure all window air conditioner units according to the manufacturer's specifications.\n\n* If you are heading to a beach, lake, or pool to beat the heat, swim where lifeguards are present. Always watch children near the water and make sure they're wearing a U.S. Coast Guard approved life jacket.\n\n* Please call or check on neighbors, especially older adults and people with disabilities.\n\n* Please keep pets indoors, hydrated, and cool as asphalt and ground conditions are significantly hotter and unsafe during heat.\n\nHelping Individuals Experiencing Homelessness:\n\n* If you see individuals out in the heat who appear immobile or disoriented, please ask them if they need assistance and call 9-1-1 immediately.\n\n* The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) operates emergency shelters at 112 Southampton St (men's shelter) and 794 Massachusetts Ave (women's shelter). These facilities are air conditioned and open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Amnesty will be called at temperatures of 90 degrees or above, so those with non-violent restrictions can access shelter out of the heat.\n\n* The City of Boston works closely with a network of shelter providers to ensure there is adequate shelter, food, water, and a cool respite from the heat.\n\n* Street outreach teams providing recovery services remain operating as normal during summertime weather. Outreach teams are providing water on outreach routes.\n\nPlayground Safety:\n\n* Shoes should be worn outdoors, including playgrounds and turf athletic fields, as surfaces can become extremely hot and cause burns, even on splash pads and spray decks.\n\nOutdoor Fires and Grilling:\n\n* No outdoor fires are allowed in Boston, including fire pits, chimineas, and bonfires.\n\n* Charcoal grills must be on the ground and away from buildings. Keep in mind the wind and never leave grills unattended. Dispose of the ash in a metal container once completely out.\n\n* Propane tank grills are only allowed on first floor porches with steps to the ground. Do not place propane tank grills near air conditioners or up against a building. Make sure all connections are tight and never carry propane tanks into a home.\n\n* Grills should always be used in a well-ventilated area.\n\nThe City of Boston's work is guided by the Heat Resilience Solutions for Boston framework to prepare for hotter summers and more intense heat events. The Heat Plan presents 26 strategies that will help build a more just, equitable, and resilient Boston. Visit boston.gov/heat regularly to learn more about the latest strategies for staying cool and to access the most up-to-date resources available. Each individual, family, and community's plan may look different: from accessing one of Boston's public pools or parks, or requesting a pop-up cooling kit for use at an outdoor event.

Officials talk to vulnerable people, install air conditioning units early and essentially figure out what to do when things get nasty and practice at it. The Miami-Dade government and the local National Weather Service office team up to treat heat like something more scary, but often less deadly.\n\nWhen Jane Gilbert took over three years ago as the county's heat officer, one of the first in an increasingly warmer nation, she said Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told her \"I want you to prepare our people on the level that we do our hurricane season.\"\n\nBecause Miami averages a hurricane landfall nearby every six years or so, according to the National Hurricane Center, getting ready for storm season is a big and quite public deal with media, stores and government all talking about preparations.\n\nWhen it comes to heat, the county first determined who was vulnerable and where they were, Gilbert said.\n\n\"We looked at emergency department visits and hospitalizations by zip code and there are some zip codes that have four or five times the rates of others,\" Gilbert said. Because of the urban heat island effect, poverty rates, amount of asphalt and greenery, some places can be more than 10 degrees hotter than measured temperatures, she said. Those zip codes tend have higher percentages of families with children.\n\nWhile Miami has a high rate of air conditioning in homes, it's expensive and many poor people can't afford it or have inefficient units so they don't use them as often as needed, Gilbert said. Before last year's heat season started, the county installed 1,700 efficient air conditioning units \"to make sure everyone under the county's care had access to efficient cooling,\" she said.\n\nWith the designation of a heat season starting May 31, officials now prepare for three different weather hazards from May to October: heat, hurricanes and floods.\n\n\"We're calling them trifecta trainings,\" Gilbert said. Volunteers go to homeless encampments, summer camps, health care clinics and vulnerable neighborhoods to talk with people, organizers, doctors and others about what to do when the high heat kicks in, what danger signs to look for. This year, Miami has 14 different trainings in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole.\n\nThe county provides cooling towels to homeless, helps coordinate water donations, hands out maps of where cooling sites are and even offers transportation when the heat gets really bad.\n\nAlso, the county and the local weather service office changed the thresholds for when heat advisories and warnings kick in and communication to the public ramps up, said National Weather Service meteorologist Sammy Hadi. Before last year, the feels-like heat index, which combines temperature and humidity, had to reach 113 degrees to be a heat warning that activates more county resources and action. That had never happened in Miami before, he said.\n\nLast year, due to community wishes and scientific data, the weather service dropped that heat warning threshold to 110 degrees. Miami-Dade got its first heat warning. In fact, the county had a heat warning on seven days last year, Hadi said.\n\nThe lower heat advisory used to be only triggered at 108 degrees, but now gets declared at 105 degrees. Last year, Miami-Dade had a record 38 days under that heat advisory.\n\nThe experiment in lower heat thresholds in Miami worked so well that neighboring suburban Broward County joined Dade, Hadi said. So far this year, South Florida has had 13 days of heat advisories, he said.\n\nPeople in vulnerable communities should know what to do, because the county has targeted those zip codes with digital ads at gas stations, grocery stores, bus shelters and billboards, Gilbert said.\n\nWhile Maricopa County in Arizona had at least 645 deaths where heat was a factor in 2023 and Texas had 450 and Nevada had 226, the official heat-related death count for Miami-Dade was so low -- 10 or fewer -- that it didn't register with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts say heat deaths are widely underreported because it is a factor that triggers other more direct causes and often doctors and medical examiners don't think to see if temperature played a role.\n\nGilbert is quick to say it's unfair to compare Phoenix's high death count to South Florida's minimal one because the Arizona city has made it a priority to make sure heat-related deaths are recorded that way, where other cities, including Miami, don't. The way Miami tracks heat deaths is not nearly as comprehensive, she said. Also, Phoenix has more homeless who are more vulnerable because they don't escape the heat indoors, she said.\n\nAnd it was hot.\n\n\"Completely unprecedented. It was like an entirely different climate regime,\" said University of Miami tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy who was tracking the warmth daily. \"The number of records we broke and the margins we broke them by was unimaginable... In the four months from mid-June to mid-October, the heat index record was broken 40% of the days.\"\n\nThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity, hit 105 degrees or above on 40 days from June 1 to September 1 last year with the city sweltering for 108 hours of that level of \"particularly oppressive\" conditions, according to the National Weather Service. The summer warm season was the hottest on record.\n\nBut heat has become a political issue.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis in April signed a bill that bars county and city governments from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers.

Officials talk to vulnerable people, install air conditioning units early and essentially figure out what to do when things get nasty and practice at it. The Miami-Dade government and the local National Weather Service office team up to treat heat like something more scary, but often less deadly.\n\nWhen Jane Gilbert took over three years ago as the county's heat officer, one of the first in an increasingly warmer nation, she said Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told her \"I want you to prepare our people on the level that we do our hurricane season.\"\n\nBecause Miami averages a hurricane landfall nearby every six years or so, according to the National Hurricane Center, getting ready for storm season is a big and quite public deal with media, stores and government all talking about preparations.\n\nWhen it comes to heat, the county first determined who was vulnerable and where they were, Gilbert said.\n\n\"We looked at emergency department visits and hospitalizations by zip code and there are some zip codes that have four or five times the rates of others,\" Gilbert said. Because of the urban heat island effect, poverty rates, amount of asphalt and greenery, some places can be more than 10 degrees hotter than measured temperatures, she said. Those zip codes tend have higher percentages of families with children.\n\nWhile Miami has a high rate of air conditioning in homes, it's expensive and many poor people can't afford it or have inefficient units so they don't use them as often as needed, Gilbert said. Before last year's heat season started, the county installed 1,700 efficient air conditioning units \"to make sure everyone under the county's care had access to efficient cooling,\" she said.\n\nWith the designation of a heat season starting May 31, officials now prepare for three different weather hazards from May to October: heat, hurricanes and floods.\n\n\"We're calling them trifecta trainings,\" Gilbert said. Volunteers go to homeless encampments, summer camps, health care clinics and vulnerable neighborhoods to talk with people, organizers, doctors and others about what to do when the high heat kicks in, what danger signs to look for. This year, Miami has 14 different trainings in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole.\n\nThe county provides cooling towels to homeless, helps coordinate water donations, hands out maps of where cooling sites are and even offers transportation when the heat gets really bad.\n\nAlso, the county and the local weather service office changed the thresholds for when heat advisories and warnings kick in and communication to the public ramps up, said National Weather Service meteorologist Sammy Hadi. Before last year, the feels-like heat index, which combines temperature and humidity, had to reach 113 degrees to be a heat warning that activates more county resources and action. That had never happened in Miami before, he said.\n\nLast year, due to community wishes and scientific data, the weather service dropped that heat warning threshold to 110 degrees. Miami-Dade got its first heat warning. In fact, the county had a heat warning on seven days last year, Hadi said.\n\nThe lower heat advisory used to be only triggered at 108 degrees, but now gets declared at 105 degrees. Last year, Miami-Dade had a record 38 days under that heat advisory.\n\nThe experiment in lower heat thresholds in Miami worked so well that neighboring suburban Broward County joined Dade, Hadi said. So far this year, South Florida has had 13 days of heat advisories, he said.\n\nPeople in vulnerable communities should know what to do, because the county has targeted those zip codes with digital ads at gas stations, grocery stores, bus shelters and billboards, Gilbert said.\n\nWhile Maricopa County in Arizona had at least 645 deaths where heat was a factor in 2023 and Texas had 450 and Nevada had 226, the official heat-related death count for Miami-Dade was so low -- 10 or fewer -- that it didn't register with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health experts say heat deaths are widely underreported because it is a factor that triggers other more direct causes and often doctors and medical examiners don't think to see if temperature played a role.\n\nGilbert is quick to say it's unfair to compare Phoenix's high death count to South Florida's minimal one because the Arizona city has made it a priority to make sure heat-related deaths are recorded that way, where other cities, including Miami, don't. The way Miami tracks heat deaths is not nearly as comprehensive, she said. Also, Phoenix has more homeless who are more vulnerable because they don't escape the heat indoors, she said.\n\nAnd it was hot.\n\n\"Completely unprecedented. It was like an entirely different climate regime,\" said University of Miami tropical weather expert Brian McNoldy who was tracking the warmth daily. \"The number of records we broke and the margins we broke them by was unimaginable... In the four months from mid-June to mid-October, the heat index record was broken 40% of the days.\"\n\nThe heat index, which combines heat and humidity, hit 105 degrees or above on 40 days from June 1 to September 1 last year with the city sweltering for 108 hours of that level of \"particularly oppressive\" conditions, according to the National Weather Service. The summer warm season was the hottest on record.\n\nBut heat has become a political issue.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis in April signed a bill that bars county and city governments from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers. It was a direct response to Miami-Dade County's effort to require shade and water for construction, farm and other outdoor workers.\n\nStill, several experts -- doctors, public health officials and meteorologists -- point to Miami, along with Phoenix and Houston, as model cities for dealing with worsening heat waves and higher death tolls triggered by human-caused climate change.\n\n\"Miami's kind of a poster child because they have a chief heat officer to begin with, so they're already ahead of the curve,\" said Morgan Zabow, community heath and health coordinator at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"Jane Gilbert with Miami-Dade County is just a rock star to begin with. And there, she's implementing so many different things across the county.\"\n\n___\n\nTerry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Mary Katherine Wildeman in Hartford, Conn. contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nRead more of AP's climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The city declares a heat advisory when three or more days of 90 degrees heat index, sustained for more than two hours per day, are predicted in the forecast.\n\n\"While this is not a heat emergency, we are advising people to take the necessary precautions such as taking breaks when working outside, staying hydrated, and checking on each other in the heat,\" Wu said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe sweltering weather has impacted how people use public transit in the city.\n\n\"Usually I like to walk to and from work -- I work right downtown -- but this week, I've been taking the train to and from and it helps a little bit. Even that two-second walk from Park Street into the office is a little tough, but making the most of it,\" said Zack Schuele.\n\n\"Maybe I'll go take a little dip in the water right there. It's nice,\" he continued, eyeing the fountains on the Rose Kennedy Greenway.\n\nMany people walking the streets of Boston held umbrellas to shield themselves from the blazing sun.\n\nSplash pads and pools are open throughout the city, and residents can also seek relief from the heat inside the various Boston Public Library locations.\n\nThe City of Boston advised residents to stay hydrated and keep cool with frequent cold showers, shade, air conditioning, and fans.

This can prevent the body from cooling down, increasing the risk of heat cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke. Dr. Jesse Bracamonte, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says the extreme heat and high humidity can be a dangerous mix.\n\n\"High heat and high humidity can place one at risk for serious illness if people aren't careful. The heat can affect people's bodies by increasing the core body temperature and ability to sweat, and cause dehydration that can cause further medical problems and ensuing issues, and eventually can lead to heat exhaustion, in some cases, severe heat illness, known as heatstroke,\" says Dr. Bracamonte.\n\nSymptoms of heat-related illnesses\n\nHeat-related illnesses can be serious. They include heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.\n\n\"Illness can be something mild, such as heat cramps, which is usually the first stage consisting of cramping and abdominal pain in some instances. Then it can progress to heat exhaustion, which is nausea, filling inability to cool, increased warmth, cramping, dehydration or mild dehydration,\" he says. \"And that can become severe, and that's known as heatstroke, which can cause disorientation, confusion, the ability to cool yourself, nausea and vomiting.\"\n\nHeat exhaustion happens when the body loses too much water or salt from heavy sweating or dehydration, usually after being active in the heat. Heatstroke is more serious and happens when the body overheats and can't cool down.\n\nWhat to do for heat-related illnesses\n\nSeeking care promptly for heat-related illnesses is crucial. You should try to cool down quickly, drink cool fluids and stay out of the heat until your symptoms get better.\n\n\"If you have symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion, it's important to stay cool,\" says Dr. Bracamonte. Seek a cool, shaded place, go indoors, and drink fluids. Consider sports drinks containing electrolyte-hydrating fluids as well -- just watch for heavy sugar content.\n\nIf you think someone has heat exhaustion, act fast to prevent heatstroke - which can be life-threatening.\n\nMove them to a shady or cool area.Lay them down and elevate their legs.Loosen tight clothing.Give them cool fluids to drink.Cool them with water and a fan.Monitor their condition closely.\n\nSigns of heatstroke include:\n\nHigh body temperature (104 F or higher).Altered mental state (confusion, agitation, slurred speech).Dry or moist skin.Nausea, vomiting.Flushed skin.Rapid breathing.Racing heart rate.Headache.\n\nIf you think someone has heatstroke, call 911 or your local emergency services immediately.\n\nRisk factors for heat-related illness\n\nSome things can make people more sensitive to heat:\n\nCertain medications (like beta blockers and antihistamines)ObesitySudden changes in temperature (like moving to a hotter climate or early heat waves)When the heat index is 91 F (33 C) or higher.\n\nIf you have questions about your medication, speak with your healthcare team.\n\nHeat and humidity can pose health risks, so it's important to take precautions to stay safe. Keep cool, stay hydrated, and stay informed to protect yourself and others when it's hot outside.\n\n\"Be careful with doing new activities that can get you dehydrated quickly, so acclimate to the heat and don't go out during the warmest parts of the day. Try to find the coolest parts of the day to keep yourself healthy and away from heat-related illness,\" says Dr. Bracamonte.\n\nUnderstanding the risks associated with high heat and humidity, recognizing the symptoms of heat-related illnesses, and knowing how to respond can help prevent serious health issues.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Daily Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_cramps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat cramps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cramp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human body temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayo Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdominal pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/azdailysun.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/d6/dd6b69b2-3e43-11ef-993a-6bc9594c805b/6682e41a49bca.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724162", "eventUri": "eng-9724162", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

During these hot summer months, farm workers are always at risk of heat-related illnesses, especially those workers who must wear protective gear during hot conditions. The most serious forms of heat illness are heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Heat illnesses are brought on when our bodies build up more heat than we can handle and our bodies cooling mechanisms become overwhelmed.\n\nHeat exhaustion is caused when the body's cooling systems are overtaxed but have not completely shut down. With heat exhaustion, the surface blood vessels and capillaries that enlarge to cool the body become collapsed due to lack of body fluids. This condition is caused when the body is sweating away more fluids than it has taken in.\n\nSymptoms include the following headache, profuse sweating, intense thirst, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, cool moist skin, weak and rapid pulse, and low to normal blood pressure. To treat heat exhaustion, move the person to the shade or ideally to an air-conditioned building. Lie the person down and slightly elevate their feet. Loosen their clothing and apply cool wet clothes or fan them. Have them drink water or electrolyte drinks. Medical personnel should examine the person. Make sure the person avoids heavy activities for at least 24 hours, and they should continue to drink water during this time period.\n\nHeat stroke is the most serious form of heat illness. This is a life threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. Heat stroke is caused by the body being depleted of water and salt causing the person's temperature to rise to dangerous levels.\n\nThe symptoms of heat stroke include very high body temperature (103\u00b0 or greater), absence of sweating, hot red or flushed dry skin, rapid pulse, difficulty breathing, pinpoint pupils, and any or all of the symptoms of heat exhaustion. More advanced symptoms could include convulsions, collapse, unconsciousness and a body temperature over 108\u00b0. It is important to note that the symptoms of heat stroke are very similar to those of pesticide poisoning.

Summer is for barbecues and beach days, camping and swimming -- a time to enjoy the great outdoors without having to bundle up.\n\nThat is, until the mercury really soars -- which is happening more and more with climate change. \"It's wayyy too hot,\" is already a common refrain this summer, from B.C. to Eastern Canada.\n\nWith that intense heat comes health risks like high humidity, UV exposure and sometimes wildfire smoke.\n\nAs the climate changes, some of those risks are becoming more intense or popping up with more frequency. Human-caused climate change makes heat domes -- like the one in Eastern Canada in June -- more likely, according to a first-of-its-kind analysis by Environment and Climate Change Canada. That heat dome was followed by this week's intense heat across the West, which set 37 records in B.C. and 13 in Alberta as temperatures soared to more than 40 C in several places in B.C.\n\n\"It is the first heat wave [of the season] and so some people may not be acclimatized, which is important in terms of some of the health risks,\" Health Canada spokesperson Peter Berry said during a media briefing.\n\n\"Some people may not be in the habit of protecting themselves from heat, given that this is early in the season. It's still really important to prepare, particularly for people that may require assistance.\"\n\nIn other words, it's time to get serious about heat.\n\nThe federal Environment Department concluded climate change, driven mostly by rising greenhouse gas emissions, is causing more extreme weather events like heat domes and contributing to increasingly frequent and ferocious wildfires.\n\nThree years ago, in June 2021, B.C. experienced a heat dome with temperatures up to 20 C above normal and set the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada: 49.6 C in Lytton on June 29. (The town was destroyed by a wildfire the next day.) The extreme heat killed 619 people, according to the BC Coroners Service, making it the deadliest weather-related event in Canadian history. Most were older people living in the urban Lower Mainland.\n\nAll of this can make summer feel more like a time for fretting than for fun. It also raises questions: how do we measure the health risks that are becoming a feature of Canadian summers? What do tools like the humidex and air quality health indexes tell us? Read on.\n\nPeople in Eastern Canada love to complain about the stickiness of humidity in the summertime. Sure, the West is having a heat wave too, they say -- but it's a dry heat. It's not the same. And while heat is heat, there's also a kernel of truth in there. Humidity can make high temperatures harder for human bodies to handle, causing us to feel even hotter and sometimes leading to health problems.\n\nWhy is humidity during a heat wave a health risk?\n\nHumidity makes it more difficult to cool down. Normally, we do it by sweating. When we perspire, moisture seeps out onto our skin and evaporates, taking with it some of the heat from our bodies. But humidity short-circuits that process: sweat won't evaporate if the air is already too wet, so the heat sticks around too. That raises the risk of health problems related to high temperatures, like heat rashes and heat-stroke. Humidity also plays a role in many of the deaths caused by heat waves.\n\nProlonged heat waves or heat dome events -- when a large area of stagnant, hot air becomes trapped near Earth's surface -- can be even more stressful on the body because the sauna-like conditions can stick around for days a time. If temperatures don't dip below 20 C at night, your body can't get respite from the stress of heat and humidity exposure, which is especially dangerous if you have underlying health conditions, like heart diseases or asthma.\n\nWhat is the goal of the humidex?\n\nExperts have come up with various formulas over the years -- including the U.S. National Weather Service's heat index -- to try to quantify the danger of high moisture in the air. Some meteorologists factor in humidity for the \"feels like\" temperature listed in forecasts, which describes how we experience the weather rather than what the thermometer reads.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada uses a tool called the humidex. Meteorologists began using it in 1965, combining measurements of heat and humidity to get a rough estimate of how hot it really feels outside so we can gauge how much the weather could affect us.\n\nFor example, during the June heat dome that hovered over Eastern Canada, meteorologists forecast temperatures of 30 C to 35 C degrees in Toronto, with a humidex around 40. Although the mercury maxed out at 35 C, it felt about as hot as it would have been if the air were 40 C and dry.\n\nA humidex rating between 20 to 29 means people might experience a bit of discomfort, though everyone responds differently to different weather conditions. At the other end of the spectrum, people should avoid exerting themselves when the humidex hits 40 to 45, according to Environment Canada. Anything above 45 is classified as dangerous, coming with a \"considerable risk\" of heat- stroke. That's when core body temperatures exceed 40 C, affecting the central nervous system and causing symptoms like nausea, seizures, disorientation and confusion -- and sometimes even loss of consciousness or coma.\n\nWhat doesn't the humidex tell us?\n\nThe humidex doesn't account for everything -- if a summer breeze by the water might cool you down, that's not part of the equation. And many other factors, like the clothes you're wearing or your age, might influence what a temperature feels like for you. Even so, experts say the humidex matters because it's a way to warn people about humidity so they can find ways to cope with it and protect themselves.\n\nPeople tend to be more familiar with the humidex in Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec. But once in a while, it will pop up on the forecast in parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan, when a mass of hot, wet air wafts north from the Caribbean or the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe UV index measures the strength of ultraviolet rays from the sun. Scientists working for Environment and Climate Change Canada created it in 1992, and it quickly took off. Within a decade, a revised version of the scale officially became a global standard for weather forecasting, used to warn people to protect their eyes and skin from intense sunlight, which can age skin and cause sunburns, eye cataracts and skin cancer.\n\nHow to read the UV index\n\nThe UV index starts at 0 and doesn't technically have a top limit, though the maximum ever recorded in Canada was a 12 (other places to the south have recorded higher values). Southern Ontario tends to experience the highest UV values in the country, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada. In general, the higher the number, the stronger the UV rays and the more precautions you should take.\n\nExperts generally recommend wearing sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat if you're going to be outside, but the risks become much higher once the UV index hits six or seven. In the eight to 10 range, experts recommend reducing your time in the sun between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. A UV index above 11 is considered extreme, with Environment and Climate Change Canada warning unprotected skin can be burned or damaged within minutes. (The agency's full breakdown of what each rating on the index means can be found here.) Snow, white sand and other white surfaces can also reflect UV rays and increase your exposure, even if the UV index for the day isn't very high.\n\nWhat makes ultraviolet rays stronger or weaker?\n\nThe index calculations are based on a few factors that naturally filter the amount of UV light we receive. First, cloud cover. Second, the angle of the sun: the atmosphere absorbs some UV rays, so the rays tend to be weaker when they take a longer path through the atmosphere, such as when the sun is close to the horizon. On the flipside, UV rays are stronger when the sun is directly overhead, with the rays taking the quickest and most direct path to the ground.\n\nThe third factor is the thickness of the ozone layer in Earth's upper atmosphere. The ozone layer shields the planet from most of the sun's UV rays, but not all. Its thickness can vary depending on atmospheric conditions and where you are. The ozone layer is also recovering from years of industrial pollution: scientists in the 1970s found some industrial chemicals were thinning the ozone layer, to the point where holes had formed. In response, 197 countries agreed to phase out those harmful chemicals.\n\nThe ozone layer is recovering, and a 2022 United Nations assessment found the hole over Antarctica is expected to stop forming around 2066.\n\nWhen ozone forms at ground level, it can irritate the lungs and cause significant negative health effects, including throat and lung irritation, coughing and shortness of breath. Long-term exposure is linked to heart and lung problems.\n\nOzone forms when heat and sunlight combine with nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are found in industrial and vehicle emissions. Lightning strikes and decaying biological matter can also generate ozone. If you've ever noticed the sky looking hazy on a hot day, it's likely to be ozone created by the heat.\n\nHow is air pollution measured?\n\nIn the 1970s, the United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced the Air Quality Index (AQI) to help communicate the severity of air pollution to the public. The index scale runs from zero to more than 500, based on the highest concentration of one of five types of air pollutants: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. (Particulate matter can include smoke, soot, dust, pollen and spores, as well as chemical particles.)\n\nAn air quality index value of zero to 50 is considered \"good,\" with no health concerns. A range of 151 to 200 is when some people may experience negative health effects such as coughing, throat soreness, chest tightness or chest pain when taking a deep breath. People who are especially vulnerable -- including older adults, children and those with chronic conditions -- can experience serious effects such as asthma attacks and bronchitis.\n\nAir quality index values above 300 are considered hazardous for everyone.\n\nWhat is the Air Quality Health Index and what does it measure?\n\nIn 2005, Health Canada and Environment Canada launched the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), designed to help people better understand health risks stemming from air conditions. It was first used in B.C. and is now the preferred scale for communicating air quality in Canada.\n\nThe health index uses a colour-coded scale of zero to 10+, based on concentrations of ozone, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide -- the pollutants found to have the greatest health impacts. A 2021 Health Canada report estimated there were 15,300 premature deaths and 8,100 hospital visits due to air pollution in Canada in 2016.\n\nThe higher the health index score, the greater your risks and the more precautions you may need to take to stay safe and comfortable.\n\nThe health index also recognizes some people are more vulnerable to air pollution than others. People with cardiovascular and lung diseases are more likely to experience negative health effects, such as shortness of breath, at lower health index levels. Seniors and children are also more vulnerable to poor air quality conditions.\n\nAt \"moderate\" health index levels of four to six, most people won't experience any health effects and can continue their regular outdoor activities. Those at higher risk may experience coughing or throat irritation and should consider skipping or rescheduling strenuous outdoor activities like hiking or running.\n\nHigh health index levels range from seven to 10, signalling everyone should consider skipping strenuous outdoor activities. When the health index hits 10+, the risk of negative health effects is very high. (You can check your local health index conditions here.)\n\nThe worst health index reading ever recorded in Canada was in Kamloops during the wildfires of 2017, when the index hit 49.\n\nHotter, drier summers have made wildfires more common across much of Canada during warmer months. In 2023, the country saw the most destructive wildfire season ever recorded, with about 6,550 fires burning more than 184,900 square kilometres in parts of B.C., Alberta, the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThose fires created massive amounts of smoke that drifted across the continent, exposing millions of people to hazardous air quality. Wildfire smoke is a mix of particulate matter, volatile compounds and gases. Particulate matter is the main cause of the darkened skies and poor visibility on smoky days. The more particulates in the air, the hazier it becomes.\n\nAir pollution particles are classified according to size. Coarse particles measure from 2.5 to 10 microns in diameter while fine particulates are less than 2.5 microns in diameter (and typically referred to as PM2.5). There are 10,000 microns in a centimetre -- a human hair is about 70 microns. Fine particulates can travel deeper into the lungs than larger ones, posing greater threats to human health. A 2021 study by researchers at McGill University estimated that 4.2 million premature deaths globally every year, including 5,900 deaths in Canada, are attributable to PM2.5 air pollution that causes strokes, heart disease, lung cancer and other lung diseases.", "source": {"uri": "thenarwhal.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Narwhal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_mcintosh@thenarwhal.ca",

Explained - News18", "body": "A heat dome is created when warm air becomes trapped beneath a stagnant patch of high-pressure air in the atmosphere, according to the Royal Meteorological Society\n\nAn oppressive heat wave has engulfed western US that has killed at least seven people, according to authorities. The city of Las Vegas surpassed recorded fifth consecutive day of temperatures at 46.1 Celsius.\n\nEven by desert standards, the prolonged baking that Nevada's largest city is experiencing is nearly unprecedented, with forecasters calling it \"the most extreme heat wave\" since the National Weather Service began keeping records in Las Vegas in 1937, according to the Associated Press.\n\nLas Vegas area has been under an excessive heat warning on three separate occasions this summer, totaling about 12 days of dangerous heat with little relief even after the sun goes down, meteorologist Morgan Stessman.\n\nIn California, at least a dozen cities broke all-time high-temperature records. Between July 5 and July 6, the mercury soared 48.33 degree Celsius and 47.22 degree Celsius in Redding, a city in Northern California, and Ukiah, north of San Francisco, respectively. Palm Springs, in Southern California, touched a record-breaking high of 51.11 degree Celsius.\n\nThe scorching temperatures are being driven by a heat dome.\n\nA heat dome is created when warm air becomes trapped beneath a stagnant patch of high-pressure air in the atmosphere, according to the Royal Meteorological Society. Heat domes can block weather from passing through, causing extreme heat conditions.\n\nThe phenomenon is associated with unusually warm periods in India, Bangladesh, China and some other Asian countries.\n\nThe high-pressure system allows more sunlight to reach the earth, which results in more warming and drying of soil. This leads to less evaporation and reduces the likelihood of the formation of rain clouds. The longer the heat dome stays in one place, the warmer conditions can get with every passing day. While heat domes cause heatwaves, they can occur without heat domes as well.\n\nA heat dome usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. But it's hard to predict how long a heat dome will persist, because they are linked to the behaviour of the jet stream.\n\nA jet stream is a fast, narrow current of air flowing from west to east that encircles the globe. It has a wave-like pattern that keeps moving from north to south and then north again. When these waves get bigger and elongated, they move slowly and sometimes can become stationary. This is when a high-pressure system gets stuck in place, and leads to the occurrence of a heat dome.\n\nAccording to National Geographic, jet stream speeds usually range from 129 to 225 km per hour (80 to 140 miles per hour), but they can reach more than 443 km per hour (275 miles per hour). They are faster in winter when the temperature differences between tropical, temperate, and polar air currents are greater.\n\nThere are two jet streams: a subtropical jet stream centered at about 30 degrees latitude and a polar-front jet stream whose position varies with the boundary between polar and temperate air. A reverse jet stream blows toward the west in tropical high altitudes during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. It is associated with the heating of the Asian continent and may help bring summer monsoons to the Indian Ocean.\n\nSome 20 million Americans, from California to Texas, were living under a federal excessive heat advisory as of Wednesday, with forecasters issuing alarms about the heat dome in the Western US. Another 11 million people were under heat advisories.\n\nClimate change has led to warmer background temperatures, exacerbating the high-pressure system. Regions that have become drier due to the same, can also create conditions that are beneficial to the formation of heat domes, according to Down to Earth.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study carried out by an international team of 27 climate researchers, who were part of the World Weather Attribution, searing temperatures recorded during the heat dome in Canada, which occurred in June that year, \"would have been virtually impossible without the influence of human-caused climate change\".\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Nature 2023, showed that the intensity of heat domes is outpacing the rate of global warming -- which means that climate change is fuelling their intensity.\n\n* Never leave people or pets in a closed car on a warm day.\n\n* If air conditioning is not available in your home go to a cooling centre.\n\n* Take cool showers or baths, wear loose, lightweight, light-colored clothing.\n\n* Use your oven less to help reduce the temperature in your home.\n\n* If you're outside, find shade. Wear a hat wide enough to protect your face.\n\n* Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\n\n* Avoid high-energy activities or work outdoors, during midday heat, if possible.\n\n* Watch for heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\n* Consider pet safety. If they are outside, make sure they have plenty of cool water and access to comfortable shade.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

South Florida on track for another scorching summer", "body": "This summer in South Florida is shaping up to be as sticky and swamp as usual, but not quite as record-breaking as last year -- yet.\n\nThe National Weather Service has been steadily pumping out heat warnings, now issued when the heat index (the \"feels like\" combination of heat and humidity) is expected to be above 105 degrees Fahrenheit. And governments have been working to keep anyone outside cool and safe as temperatures climb.\n\n\"Sometimes people don't fully take seriously the risk that this is,\" said Jane Gilbert, Miami-Dade's chief heat officer. \"It can be quite serious if they're overexposed.\"\n\nLast year, Miami-Dade partnered with the NWS's Miami office to lower the threshold for issuing heat advisories and heat warnings. The pilot project continued this year, and starting in July, Broward County joined the experiment.\n\n\"Overall lowering the threshold causes us to have more heat advisories than we used to have,\" said Barry Baxter, a meteorologist for NWS in Miami.\n\nREAD MORE: When is it too hot to be outside? A new online tool will help you plan your week\n\nFor June of 2023, the first year NWS lowered the threshold, there were five heat warnings for the month. This June, there were three days.\n\nSo far this July, there have been seven heat warnings. Baxter said we are on track for a similar July as last year, which had 26 heat warnings, but he isn't seeing any trends stick out yet.\n\nIt's too early to guarantee if the rest of the summer will approach last year's record-breaking temperatures, Baxter said. However, ocean temperatures are hotter than usual earlier in the season, and nighttime temps have risen over recent decades due to climate change.\n\nThe 30-year average nighttime temperature is 75 degrees, and they've been running in the mid-80s this summer, Baxter said.\n\nCommunicating the heat message\n\nRecently, Miami-Dade began declaring an official \"heat season\" stretching from May to October. It signals a boost in county outreach and funding efforts to help its residents stay safe during the hottest days of the year.\n\n\"Each year our response machine gets a little more well-oiled,\" said Gilbert, the chief heat officer.\n\nThis year, Gilbert said the county has focused on training staffers to approach homeless people living outside and offer them water bottles, electrolytes and cooling towels, as well as encouraging people to take advantage of the county's \"cooling centers\" around the county.\n\nMiami-Dade directs residents to more than 50 of the spots around the county, usually libraries and county parks with indoor, air-conditioned community spaces.\n\nThese locations are helpful for anyone who doesn't have reliable air conditioning in their home, or who can't afford the higher electricity bills that come with summer AC usage in Florida.\n\nMiami-Dade has seen a spike in emergency calls for heat-related issues this summer, Gilbert said, particularly on heat advisory days and on weekends, when more people are out and about.\n\nThat's why the biggest push from the county this year has been communicating the risks of being outside in the heat, she said.\n\nMiami-Dade plastered its heat safety message on busses, bus shelters (hundreds of which have had new shade features installed in recent years), digital ads at gas stations, medical offices and on the radio -- all in English, Spanish and Haitian Creole.\n\nThe county is also making a special push for outdoor workers and pregnant women, who are more at risk of health issues from heat exposure.\n\n\"This year our messaging is in more channels and also more targeted,\" Gilbert said.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors":

Here's how to stay safe", "body": "Temperatures continue to broil across the Western United States as another heat dome settles over Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Dangerous heat remains in the west for the (rest) of this week and is expected to spread eastward over the weekend and early next week,\" the National Weather Service wrote on X on Tuesday. \"The persistent and record-breaking heat is extremely dangerous to those without access to cooling.\"\n\nExtreme temperatures put more than 144 million Americans under heat alerts, per Heat.gov. Roughly 1 in 5 Americans are currently under heat advisory.\n\nJune 2024 was the 13th consecutive month to break global heat records, reported The Associated Press. Global temperatures are 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on average than than pre-industrial times.\n\nExtreme temperatures across the West are crushing records. During the past week, heat records were shattered in these Western cities (per The Washington Post):\n\nThe West was scorched by a heat dome in early June, as the Deseret News previously reported. Excessive temperatures are forecasted to persist in the coming weeks thanks to the arrival of another heat dome, per KSL News.\n\n\"Summer temperatures, on average, will be hotter than normal from New England through the Atlantic Corridor, in Florida and the Deep South, through Texas and the Midwest, and on to California,\" The Farmer's Almanac forecasted for summer 2024.\n\nHeat domes drive up temperatures by trapping hot air beneath a high-pressure atmosphere, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The pressure system can block winds and clouds from forming within the dome, resulting in stagnant heat.\n\n\"The heat dome can stretch over several states and linger for days to weeks, leaving the people, crops and animals below to suffer through stagnant, hot air that can feel like an oven,\" per Scientific American. \"A heat dome can have serious impacts on people, because the stagnant weather pattern that allows it to exist usually results in weak winds and an increase in humidity.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2021, an intense heat dome in the Northwest pushed temperatures into the triple digits. Hundred of people died across the Northwest during the heat dome, many of which were at home without air conditioning, per Oregon Public Broadcasting.\n\nExtreme heat claims more lives than tornados, floods and hurricanes combined, reports Scientific American. July 2023 was the hottest month ever observed on Earth, according to a report from The World Meteorological Organization.\n\nMore than 2,300 people died from excessive heat in 2023 -- the greatest amount in 45 years, according to The Associated Press. Following record-breaking temperatures in June, summer 2024 is stacking up to be even hotter than last year.\n\nAccording to Heat.gov, heat-related illness and death is typically preventable through, \"proper planning, education, and action.\"\n\nHow can you stay safe in excessive heat?

In Las Vegas on Wednesday, the city experienced its fifth day of 115 degree heat, a new all-time record. On the same day, a temperature gauge at Harry Reid International Airportwas measured at 118 degrees, surpassing the previous daily high temperature set in 2021.\n\nIn Needles, California, and Kingman, Arizona, Wednesday's afternoon highs tied previous record temperatures at 122 and 111 degrees, respectively. Several cities in Oregon also reached new record temperatures this week, including Salem and Portland. At least 30 deaths across the West this month are suspected to be related to the extreme heat plaguing the region, according to state officials and media reports.\n\nIn the Northeast the searing heat that pushed \"feels like temperatures\" into the triple digits across Washington D.C. and New York City diminished on Thursday, though dangerous heat is projected to reemerge over the region this weekend and next week.\n\nRemnants of Hurricane Beryl, meanwhile, continue to dump heavy rain over the Northeast, triggering flood warnings across parts of New England as residents in western New York clean up the damage from at least one suspected tornado that damaged buildings, downed power lines and knocked over trees. The Vermont State Police on Thursday said roads across the state were closed due to flooding.\n\nAcross southeast Texas, where the Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a Category 1 storm on Monday, over a million people were still without power as a third day of excessive heat was projected to again drive temperatures into the 90s and heat index levels into triple digits.\n\nIncessant heat linked to at least 30 deaths across the West Coast\n\nAcross the West, heat has been named as the suspected culprit in connection with at least 30 deaths this month. Heat death totals, which are typically underreported, are expected to rise as a heat wave continues to surge temperatures to record breaking levels.\n\nIn California's Santa Clara County, the medical examiner's office is investigating at least 18 suspected heat-related deaths this month, according to KGO-TV. In Death Valley National Park, a group of motorcyclists faced scorching heat Saturday as temperatures soared to 128 degrees, leaving one dead and another in a hospital with \"severe heat illness.\" In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan confirmed an unhoused person died outside from the blistering heat last Tuesday when the city first reached triple-digit temperatures.\n\nThis month at least 10 people died of suspected heat-related illnesses across Oregon, according to the state's medical examiner's office, including at least four suspected deaths in Multnomah County, which encompasses Portland.\n\nIn western Arizona, a 4-month-old toddler died from heat exposure following a boat trip on Friday, when the day's highest temperature reached 120 degrees, multiple outlets reported.\n\nTornadoes cause damage in western N.Y., Syracuse University evacuated\n\nRemnants of Hurricane Beryl sweeping over the Northeast brought powerful thunderstorms to parts of New York State, triggering the evacuation of Syracuse University as officials issued tornado warnings and at least three twisters touched down.\n\nThe weather service said the tornadoes moved across the towns of Arkwright, Eden, Darien and Alexander. The largest twister touched down in Arkwright and had peak winds of 110 mph.\n\nThe dangerous weather put the town of Eden, in Western New York, under a state of emergency and canceled or postponed several events in the Rochester area.\n\nEden saw road closures and a state of emergency as visuals emerged on social media of scattered trees, power lines and roofing material. Several videos of the tornado were posted to X, showing mangled power lines, uprooted trees and damaged buildings.\n\nIn Erie County, which encompasses Buffalo, power to nearly 10,000 homes and businesses was knocked out.\n\nOppressive heat lingers over Texas as outages abound\n\nOver 1 million people in southeast Texas were in store for another day of miserable heat as forecasters say \"feels like temperatures\" will reach 106 degrees on Thursday.\n\n\"Residents without power should be mindful of the heat and take precautions now,\" the weather service said.\n\nMore than 1.3 million homes and businesses remain without power across southeast Texas, according to PowerOutage.us. CenterPoint Energy, the main utility company in Houston and its surrounding areas, reported over 1 million outages as of Thursday morning, down from its peak of 2.26 million on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday night, the company said it had restored power to over 900,000 customers experiencing outages.\n\n\"We take our responsibility of serving our customers and working as safely and as quickly as possible to restore service very seriously,\" Lynnae Wilson, the senior vice president, said in a statement. \"At the same time, we fully understand our customers are hot and growing

In Las Vegas on Wednesday, the city experienced its fifth day of 115 degree heat, a new all-time record. On the same day, a temperature gauge at Harry Reid International Airportwas measured at 118 degrees, surpassing the previous daily high temperature set in 2021.\n\nIn Needles, California, and Kingman, Arizona, Wednesday's afternoon highs tied previous record temperatures at 122 and 111 degrees, respectively. Several cities in Oregon also reached new record temperatures this week, including Salem and Portland. At least 30 deaths across the West this month are suspected to be related to the extreme heat plaguing the region, according to state officials and media reports.\n\nIn the Northeast the searing heat that pushed \"feels like temperatures\" into the triple digits across Washington D.C. and New York City diminished on Thursday, though dangerous heat is projected to reemerge over the region this weekend and next week.\n\nRemnants of Hurricane Beryl, meanwhile, continue to dump heavy rain over the Northeast, triggering flood warnings across parts of New England as residents in western New York clean up the damage from at least one suspected tornado that damaged buildings, downed power lines and knocked over trees. The Vermont State Police on Thursday said roads across the state were closed due to flooding.\n\nAcross southeast Texas, where the Hurricane Beryl made landfall as a Category 1 storm on Monday, over a million people were still without power as a third day of excessive heat was projected to again drive temperatures into the 90s and heat index levels into triple digits.\n\nAcross the West, heat has been named as the suspected culprit in connection with at least 30 deaths this month. Heat death totals, which are typically underreported, are expected to rise as a heat wave continues to surge temperatures to record breaking levels.\n\nIn California's Santa Clara County, the medical examiner's office is investigating at least 18 suspected heat-related deaths this month, according to KGO-TV. In Death Valley National Park, a group of motorcyclists faced scorching heat Saturday as temperatures soared to 128 degrees, leaving one dead and another in a hospital with \"severe heat illness.\" In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan confirmed an unhoused person died outside from the blistering heat last Tuesday when the city first reached triple-digit temperatures.\n\nThis month at least 10 people died of suspected heat-related illnesses across Oregon, according to the state's medical examiner's office, including at least four suspected deaths in Multnomah County, which encompasses Portland.\n\nIn western Arizona, a 4-month-old toddler died from heat exposure following a boat trip on Friday, when the day's highest temperature reached 120 degrees, multiple outlets reported.\n\nRemnants of Hurricane Beryl sweeping over the Northeast brought powerful thunderstorms to parts of New York State, triggering the evacuation of Syracuse University as officials issued tornado warnings and at least three twisters touched down.\n\nThe weather service said the tornadoes moved across the towns of Arkwright, Eden, Darien and Alexander. The largest twister touched down in Arkwright and had peak winds of 110 mph.\n\nThe dangerous weather put the town of Eden, in Western New York, under a state of emergency and canceled or postponed several events in the Rochester area.\n\nEden saw road closures and a state of emergency as visuals emerged on social media of scattered trees, power lines and roofing material. Several videos of the tornado were posted to X, showing mangled power lines, uprooted trees and damaged buildings.\n\nIn Erie County, which encompasses Buffalo, power to nearly 10,000 homes and businesses was knocked out.\n\nOver 1 million people in southeast Texas were in store for another day of miserable heat as forecasters say \"feels like temperatures\" will reach 106 degrees on Thursday.\n\n\"Residents without power should be mindful of the heat and take precautions now,\" the weather service said.\n\nMore than 1.3 million homes and businesses remain without power across southeast Texas, according to PowerOutage.us. CenterPoint Energy, the main utility company in Houston and its surrounding areas, reported over 1 million outages as of Thursday morning, down from its peak of 2.26 million on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday night, the company said it had restored power to over 900,000 customers experiencing outages.\n\n\"We take our responsibility of serving our customers and working as safely and as quickly as possible to restore service very seriously,\" Lynnae Wilson, the senior vice president, said in a statement. \"At the same time, we fully understand our customers are hot and growing more impatient with their outages.\"\n\nContributing: Minnah Arshad, USA TODAY; Emily Barnes, Democrat and Chronicle", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

And recent research suggests that the threshold for surviving heat is far lower than what some scientists once thought, particularly for older people and in dry climates.\n\n\"We can only sweat so much, and older people even less,\" said Jennifer Vanos, an associate professor in the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University.\n\n\"Where we live in the U.S., heat deaths should be 100% percent preventable.

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nThe US Department of Labor has released a proposed rule with the goal of protecting millions of workers from the significant health risks of extreme heat. If finalized, the rule would help protect approximately 36 million workers in indoor and outdoor work settings and substantially reduce heat injuries, illnesses, and deaths in the workplace.\n\nBarriers to enacting this and other federal rules, however, have emerged with a recent US Supreme Court decision. In a 6-3 vote divided along ideological lines, the justices significantly expanded plaintiffs' ability to sue federal regulators. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, writing for the dissenting liberal bloc, warned that the decision could have \"staggering\" implications, particularly in light of the court's previous decision on June 28 eliminating the doctrine of deference to an agency's reasonable interpretation of the laws that it administers.\n\nIn that case, the Supreme Court withdrew a 40-year-old standard for decision making that required federal courts to defer to reasonable agency decisions where federal law is silent or unclear.\n\n\"A government agency must conform to any clear legislative statements when interpreting and applying a law, but courts will give the agency deference in ambiguous situations as long as its interpretation is reasonable.\"\n\nThis \"Chevron deference\" standard is now gone, ushering in a new era where courts will not have to accept agency expertise in their review of challenged regulations. Where does that leave the proposed Biden-Harris administration rule that would protect workers both indoors and outdoors from heat injuries, illnesses, and deaths in the workplace?\n\nFor restaurant workers in the US, the proposed rule is seen as an important opportunity to provide urgent relief to kitchen workers, emphasizing the need to protect against the extreme temperatures workers face every day indoors.\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\nThe extreme heat rule: The Biden-Harris administration has announced a groundbreaking new rule that would protect workers from the dangerous effects of extreme heat, saying that excessive workplace heat can lead to heat stroke and even death. The proposed rule would require employers to develop an injury and illness prevention plan to control heat hazards in workplaces affected by excessive heat. Employers would also be required to provide training, have procedures to respond if a worker is experiencing signs and symptoms of a heat-related illness, and take immediate action to help a worker experiencing signs and symptoms of a heat emergency.\n\nAdditionally, the plan would require employers to evaluate heat risks and -- when heat increases risks to workers -- implement requirements for drinking water, rest breaks, and control of indoor heat. It would also require a plan to protect new or returning workers unaccustomed to working in high heat conditions.\n\nThe agency is also prioritizing programmed inspections in agricultural industries that employ temporary, nonimmigrant H-2A workers for seasonal labor. These workers face unique vulnerabilities, including potential language barriers, less control over their living and working conditions, and possible lack of acclimatization, and are at high risk of hazardous heat exposure.\n\nCommercial kitchens and extreme heat: The proposed rule highlights the growing concern to protect workers from heat-related illnesses, especially in settings such as commercial kitchens where temperatures can reach a scorching 130\u00b0F. Already, restaurants are transitioning away from gas-powered appliances, which raise temperatures in the kitchen, to electric equipment like induction cooktops that more efficiently cook food and do not emit excess heat into the surrounding environment.\n\n\"The heat is uncomfortable. It's almost like disregard for the comfort of workers the way that kitchen life here is just accepted. ... We'd go to the walk-in coolers and freezers and we'd be steaming off of our skin simply because we're so hot.\"\n\nThose are the words of TikTok star chef Jon Kung, who describes the unbearable, sweltering conditions kitchen workers face as they struggle to make ends meet in temperatures that, at times, reach 130\u00b0F heat. To earn a paycheck, many are forced to endure the devastating effects of dehydration, heat exhaustion, and sleep interruptions.\n\nWhat's the answer to extreme heat in commercial kitchens? For restaurants in the US, the proposed rule is an opportunity to provide urgent relief to kitchen workers, emphasizing the need to protect against the extreme temperatures workers face every day indoors. Cooling solutions are available -- many chefs already prefer cooking with electric induction ranges, and restaurants are increasingly opting to go all-electric with efficient induction cooking technology that can keep workers and patrons cooler while also saving on energy costs.\n\nWhy the induction ranges win: Consider this: 90% of the heat from induction cooking goes toward cooking food while 70% of the energy released by gas stoves is displaced into kitchens. 90% of the heat from induction cooking goes toward cooking food while 70% of the energy released by gas stoves is displaced into kitchens. The gas range's \"blue flame\" licks the outside of the pan, releasing heat (and pollutants) into the kitchen. In contrast, induction cooking directly heats the pan and food, dramatically reducing heat loss.\n\nMany chefs already prefer cooking with electric induction ranges, and restaurants are increasingly opting to go all-electric with efficient induction cooking technology that can keep workers and patrons cooler while also saving on energy costs. As a result, electric kitchens are cooler and less reliant on air conditioning -- adding up to greater comfort and big savings on overall energy costs. As co-founder of EcoChef and Forward Dining Solution, chef Chris Galarza is part of the first and only firm in the US to focus exclusively on developing and implementing commercial electric kitchens. In fact, Galarza, who cooks in an electric kitchen, often wears a sweater to work.\n\nAre cool commercial kitchens the only way forward? Not necessarily. A coalition of gas companies and their supporters have partnered with restaurant associations to ensure the right for chefs to cook with gas. The coalition has made headway in several prominent communities and is now planning to confront rules across the western US to limit the installation of gas stoves in new buildings. But the Physicians for Social Responsibility consortium counters:\n\n\"Gas stove pollution is like having a chain-smoking roommate in your kitchen. With each use, it releases harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde, just like constant puffs of smoke filling the air. Just as you wouldn't tolerate a chain-smoker indoors, it's crucial to address gas stove emissions to maintain a healthy living environment.\"\n\nBut who knows best? A coalition of physicians, or an ideologically-driven cohort of judges?\n\nThe Supremes want to be able to control rules like this. Even if courts were to draw upon independent judgment to determine the meaning of federal statutes, they still are not experts in specific fields and should not be relied upon to make such judgments.", "source": {"uri": "cleantechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CleanTechnica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carolyn_fortuna@cleantechnica.com", "name": "Carolyn Fortuna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Induction cooking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clean technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CleanTechnica", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CleanTechnica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

And recent research suggests that the threshold for surviving heat is far lower than what some scientists once thought, particularly for older people and in dry climates.\n\n\"We can only sweat so much, and older people even less,\" said Jennifer Vanos, an associate professor in the School of Sustainability at Arizona State University.\n\n\"Where we live in the U.S., heat deaths should be 100% percent preventable. There should be air conditioning in some location. But, in some parts of the world, that doesn't exist.\"\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nThe human body can't tolerate its temperature reaching 43 degrees C (about 109.4 degrees F).\n\n\"Anyone who reaches that core temperature -- 99.9% would die,\" Vanos said.\n\nThis is the upper limit of survival.

Otherwise, heat won't flow away from your body.\n\nAfter an influential study in 2010, climate researchers often use a wet bulb temperature of 35 degrees C -- roughly equivalent to 95 degrees F at 100% humidity -- as an upper limit for human survival and adaptability without cooling.\n\nBut this maximum doesn't factor things like sun exposure, clothing and movement.\n\nIn a 2020 study, researchers found that extremely humid heat had doubled in frequency since 1979 and that several parts of the world, including coastal India, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Mexico, had neared that wet-bulb threshold. Two locations briefly exceeded it.\n\nDenning said researchers are concerned about a mass mortality event in those regions, as global temperatures continue to rise.\n\n\"In large urban areas in the Arabian sea and the Indian Ocean region, there are hundreds of millions of people who don't have air conditioning.\"\n\nBut new research suggests the upper limits are not realistic.\n\nA 2022 study in the Journal of Applied Physiology, which used data from heat chamber tests, estimated that the threshold for wet-bulb temperatures is probably closer to 30-31 degrees Celsius (86 to 87.8 degrees F) for \"young, healthy\" subjects performing basic life tasks.\n\nVanos said everyone's survival limit will be different and factors like age are critical.\n\nHer research, which was published in Nature Communications last winter, suggests the physiological thresholds for heat stroke are far lower than previously understood, particularly in dry heat.\n\nThe research suggests most older adults, who can't sweat as effectively, are at grave risk if exposed for six hours to temperatures above 115 degrees F, even when the humidity is low and they are shaded.\n\n\"There will never be one threshold to survivability, and thinking that way is dangerous,\" Vanos said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

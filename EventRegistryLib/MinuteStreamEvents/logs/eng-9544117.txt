The celebration will begin at noon local time at Bruce Trent Park.\n\n\"We will have guests from different states of America. Mrs. Elka Rouskov, Honorary Consul of Bulgaria in Washington State and organiser of the tour of the documentary film about Vaklush Tolev (a theologian, public figure and university lecturer. b. 1923, d. 2013 - ed.), will be at the festival together with the film's director Nikolay Vasilev. The film \"Vaklush\" (2023) will be screened a few days after the festival in Vegas.\n\nWe also have another good reason to celebrate - popular singer Yordanka Hristova is on tour in America and will be in Las Vegas on May 15 - we are looking forward to seeing her.\n\nThe festival on the 5th of May has a dynamic and interesting programme. A special guest will be another star of Bulgarian pop music - singer Kichka Bodurova, who has lived in Las Vegas for many years and now divides her time between Bulgaria and the USA.\n\n\"We will also have guests from Chicago - Konstantin Marinov, the leader of the folklore club \"Vereya\" and the organiser of the big three-day folklore festival in Chicago that ended a few days ago. He will come with some of the participants of the festival, for which we are very grateful. The \"Bulgarche\" ensemble from the Romanian town of Vinga in the Banat region will be coming to give a joint performance with our folklore group \"Zharava\". We are looking forward to seeing them all\".\n\nThe programme also features talented children from the gymnastics clubs, the fabulous theatre workshop Dwarves in Drawers and the two Sunday schools in Las Vegas - the First Bulgarian School Vasil Levski and the Children's Academy Rodna Rech. Talented young musicians - Bulgarian and American - from various art schools will perform music from Bulgaria, Maria Samichkova also tells us.\n\n\"This year we have prepared many surprises, games and fun activities for the children. We also have a general sponsor for the event and vendors who will offer lots of delicious food - Bulgarian, but not only. Our celebration coincides with \"Cinco de Mayo\" - one of the most revered holidays in Mexico, so there will be representatives of that country offering delicious Mexican food, and in general it will be very festive, very dynamic - promises Maria Samichkova on behalf of the Bulgarian Association in Nevada, adding: \"I wish all Bulgarians a happy Orthodox Easter!\"\n\nFurther reading:March 3 on the

After the religious rite, President Rumen Radev reviewed the troops of the four armed services.\n\nThe national anthem was played and a 20-gun salute was fired.\n\nNext, service members representing the Land Forces, the Bulgarian Air Force, the Bulgarian Navy and the Special Operations Forces marched past the dignitaries in Sveti Alexander Nevsky Square.\n\nFinally, there was a flypast by three MiG-29 jet fighters over the square.\n\nBits of History\n\nOn January 9, 1880 Prince Alexander I designated April 17 Day of the Military Order for Valour (the first Bulgarian order he instituted on January 1, 1880). The Military Order for Valour Day was marked modestly with a memorial prayer service and a luncheon limited to the officers and soldiers on whom this honour had been conferred.\n\nOn April 10, 1891 Prince Ferdinand I decreed the transfer of the Military Order for Valour Day from April 17 to April 23 (it was moved to May 6 in 1916 when Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian Calendar), merging the observance with the Feast Day of the military's patron saint, St George the Victorious, and extending the festivities to the entire military personnel.\n\nUntil 1919 Bulgaria had two military holidays: the Day of Valour (May 6) and the Day of Combat Glory (November 27, the anniversary of the Bulgarian victory in the Battle of Slivnitsa during the 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War). The latter celebration was abandoned in the 1920s because November 27 was also the date of signature in 1919 of the Treaty of Neuilly that sealed Bulgaria's disastrous defeat in WW I. From then on, May 6 was observed simultaneously as a Day of Valour and of the Bulgarian Army, and this arrangement was formalized by a royal decree in 1931.\n\nThe first solemn torchlight tattoo and roll-call was organized on the eve of St George's Day in 1937. Since then, this sunset retreat ceremony, during which the names of the most prominent dead heroes are called out in remembrance, has been an integral part of each national observance.\n\nA Council of Ministers decree of May 2, 1947 abolished the St George's Day celebration, including the military parades tradition. Until 1953 the Bulgarian People's Army marked its day on September 9, after which September 23 (the anniversary of the outbreak of the Communist-led September 1923 Uprising) replaced that date. After the advent of democracy, the Seventh Grand National Assembly designated August 23 Bulgarian Army Day, marking the anniversary of the decisive Battle of Shipka in 1877 which was won thanks to the heroism of the Bulgarian volunteers. Observances on that date, however, took place only twice, in 1991 and 1992. On January 27, 1993 a Council of Ministers decree reinstated May 6 as a Day of Valour and of the Bulgarian Armed Forces.\n\nMay 6 has been a public holiday (non-working day) since 1998.", "source":

With the permission of Sultan Abdul Hamid II and with the cooperation of the Edirne valia (administrative governor) Reuf Pasha, on April 23, 1880, the foundations of the church of St. George the Victorious were laid. Reuf Pasha granted 400 liras for the Bulgarian church, after providing the Greek municipality with the Holy Trinity church, for which Bulgarians and Greeks argued. Reuf Pasha was a close friend of the Bulgarian bishop Synesius, who made great efforts to restore the Bulgarian congregation as the ruler of the Edirne diocese.\n\nUnfortunately, after the signing of the Sultan's decree on the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchy in 1870, under the pressure of the Holy Synod of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Bulgarian church community in Edirne remained in its diocese. The only possibility for him to join the Exarchate was the \"loophole\" left by the Turkish side - at least two-thirds of the Orthodox Bulgarians in the Edirne diocese to express their desire for it. These plans of Synesius, however, collided with the intrigues of the Catholic Bulgarian municipality in Edirne.\u200e\n\nOn the other hand, the Greek bishops of the diocese also tried in every possible way to thwart his plans. However, the Bulgarian bishop did not give up and toured the villages in Edirne and Aegean Thrace, helping to build churches and Bulgarian schools, consecrating newly built buildings and ordaining priests. And although he did not succeed in this endeavor, the Bulgarian community in Edirne to this day continues to support the two Orthodox churches of St. St. Constantine and Elena and of St. George the Victorious, which remain the only ones in the city. \u200e\n\nThanks to the voluntary efforts of Father Filip Cikirik, a descendant of Bulgarians from Edirne, the church of St. George the Victorious was saved from ruin after it closed its doors in 1951. Father Philip supported it with his own funds together with his son Alexander Cikirik, who managed to organize charity campaigns and initiatives for its restoration. \u200e\n\n20 years ago, the restored church was solemnly opened and consecrated on May 9, 2004 by His Eminence Metropolitan Neophyte of Ruse. Until March 17, 2023, Father Alexander Cikirik developed a real educational activity, but after his death, the diocese was orphaned and remained without a priest:\u200e\n\n\"We will try to continue the work of Father Alexander because it is a worthy deed and must be maintained\", noted Father Angel from Svilengrad on the day of the anniversary of the death of the priest from Edirne. \"Bulgaria and the Bulgarian spirit must be maintained and services in the church should be performed only in the Bulgarian language. This is a Bulgarian temple, built with Bulgarian funds, by Bulgarians, who gave their lives, dedicated their lives, so that these churches are in the state we see them in now. We will try to serve, but this does not depend only on us, but also on the blessing of Metropolitan Amfilochius of Adrianople, who has given his verbal consent that services in this church should be conducted in Bulgarian.\"\u200e\n\nBulgarians in Edirne have the support of the Bulgarian presidential institution, in the person of Vice President Iliana Iotova, who stated that she would make every effort so that church services in the temple are again held in the Bulgarian language, as it was during the time of Father Alexander. \u200e\n\n\"Soon, we will have a church service at least once a month\", assures Archim. Atanasiy Sultanov from the Diocese of Stara Zagora. \"Unfortunately, there is a huge lack of priests in Bulgaria and no one can be permanently sent here. If it becomes necessary to appoint a permanent priest, I guess the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Bulgarian Patriarchate will find an agreement and a priest will be sent. Metropolitan Amfilochius is open to this. After all, he is the Metropolitan of Edirne and we must have his blessing.\"\n\nThere remains the hope that the son of Father Alexander - Georgi will continue the mission of his father and grandfather. May Saint George help him fulfill his dream of serving the Bulgarian community in Edirne!\u200e\n\nWhat was created by priest Alexander Cikirik in Edirne is bearing fruitRemembering Father Alexander:

This was not an easy process, but it shows that there was a significant number of compatriots who disagreed with the governance and the repressions in Bulgaria after September 9, 1944. The vast majority of them were in various European capitals, as in Bulgaria they were declared non-returnees. As political emigrants, some of these Bulgarians united in two groups established in 1948- the Bulgarian National Committee headed by Dr. G.M. Dimitrov and the Bulgarian National Front, which was under the leadership of Ivan Dochev.\n\nThe American diplomacy chose to collaborate with the Bulgarian National Committee and contacted its Chairman, Georgi Mihov Dimitrov. They urged him to start creating national volunteer units, similar to those formed in various European countries by Russian, Czechoslovak, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian emigrants. The status of the participants was regulated by a special law passed by the U.S. Congress on June 30, 1950, allowing foreign citizens to serve in the United States Armed Forces. In 1951, the Congress earmarked USD 100 million for similar formations created by emigrants. In his study on the subject, historian Stoyan Nikolov from the \"Georgi Rakovski\" Military Academy explains:\n\n''In September 1951, the first Bulgarian volunteers arrived at the barracks in the town of Zeilsheim, now a residential district of Frankfurt, and the unit was filled in the space of several months. They moved illegally from France to the barracks in the American occupation zone. All of them were required to fill out a questionnaire issued by the headquarters of the Northern Command of the Central American Army in West Germany to verify their political and military reliability. The Bulgarian National Volunteer Company 4093 was officially formed on October 20, 1951, by Order No. 53 issued by the Headquarters of the U.S. Military Command. It comprised 200 soldiers divided into four platoons of 40 men each and one ''Administration\" platoon''.\n\n15 battalions comprising almost 25,000 people were formed following a decision by President Eisenhower on February 14, 1953. These ''labor companies'' were under the command of the American Armed Forces in Europe. They included nearly 5,000 Eastern Europeans who were tasked with assisting the US military in guard duty and logistics and, after three years of service, they were elegible to legally emigrate to the United States. These units were under the control of the American Armed Forces in Europe and had nothing to do with NATO military structures.\n\nIn April 1953, the unit was relocated from Zeilsheim to the nearby town of Eschborn near Frankfurt for a period of three months. Part of its tasks included patrolling in front of the headquarters of the American Armed Forces' Northern Command and providing nighttime security for the residence of the military governor of the American occupation zone, General Lucius D. Clay. The unit also guarded the US Army's radio transmitter, machines, chemical depots, etc.\n\nThe activities of the company leaders did not go unnoticed by the Bulgarian authorities:\n\n''The commanders of the unit were Stefan Boydev, Borislav Baychev and Dimitar Krastev - explains historian Stoyan Nikolov. - Like any former royal officers, they came under the pressure of the Fatherland Front government in Bulgaria. They were dealt with differently, but they were all thrown out of the army in their prime.''\n\nThe Bulgarian State Security made several unsuccessful attempts to infiltrate its agents into the unit. Until its disbandment in 1964, the US Armed Forces reportedly spent around USD 150 million on the unit.\n\nPublished and translated by Kostadin Atanasov\n\nPhotos: National Museum of Military History; BGNES; Facebook / DRGemeDimitrovGeorgiMihovDimitrov", "source": {"uri": "bnr.bg", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Bulgarie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ioan_kolev@bnr.bg", "name": "Ioan Kolev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Sava_Rakovski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgi Sava Rakovski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Dimitrov", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgi Dimitrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barracks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoyan_Nikolov", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stoyan Nikolov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeilsheim", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zeilsheim"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zeilsheim"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allied-occupied Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Platoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia and montenegro"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lithuania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Estonia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_D._Clay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucius D.

Since Davkova did not win a majority, a second round will be held on 8 May alongside the parliamentary elections. Her winning the ceremonial presidency would have little significance, but her performance could boost the pro-Russian VMRO-DPMNE's chances in the all-important contest for the legislature.\n\nNorth Macedonia's EU membership perspective is at the heart of the parliamentary elections. The country has been a candidate since 2005, in a process that has been slowed down by disputes. Changing its name to North Macedonia in 2019 resolved a 27-year argument with Greece but a dispute with Bulgaria still simmers.\n\nBulgaria has demanded that North Macedonia include its ethnic Bulgarian minority in the constitution as one of the state's founding peoples, alongside Albanians, Bosniaks, Roma, Serbs, and Turks. This is part of a larger dispute over history and identity that has been going on for more than 30 years. This change in the constitution was included into the EU accession process, at Bulgaria's request, to put an end to discrimination against Bulgarians in the country. The constitutional amendment was put to a vote in parliament last year, but it did not get the two-thirds majority required.\n\nA bilateral dispute between an EU member and a candidate state is nothing new, but those cases have historically been solved outside the accession process. This is what happened, for example, in the dispute between Croatia and Slovenia over a sea and land border demarcation in the Adriatic Sea. In the context of the elections, there is some concern in North Macedonia that, even if the constitutional change is made, Bulgaria could raise another requirement in the negotiations and potentially yield a veto. However, Sofia has repeatedly said that it will not demand new requirements and European Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood Oliver Varhelyi confirmed that there will be no change in the process.\n\nBulgaria as an Electoral Issue\n\nBulgaria, Bulgarians, and the constitutional change are more or less the main topic in the parliamentary elections campaign. VMRO-DPMNE has instrumentalized the fear of another Bulgarian veto. According to polls in mid-April, it is set to come in first with more than 23%, followed by the SDSM with around 13%, and the European Front (regrouping Albanian, Roma, and Turkish parties) with 7%. The latter two are in favor of the constitutional change, but it was VMRO-DPMNE's refusal to support it in parliament that led to it not being adopted. The party says that it will continue to block the change and, with it, North Macedonia's EU perspective. VMRO-DPMNE also argues that Bulgaria could impose further requirements. If it forms the next government, it is likely to try to renegotiate the accession conditions and push for having the dispute resolved separately.\n\nBulgaria and the EU see the exclusion of the Bulgarian minority in North Macedonia's constitution as discriminatory. Until they are not recognized like other groups in the constitution, they will remain deprived of rights pertaining to legal protection from discrimination based on their ethnicity, to the use of their language and access to education and media in it, to having a representative in the parliament's Community Relations Committee, and to a guaranteed percentage of employment in the state administration. Cases of aggression against Bulgarian symbols and institutions in North Macedonia have influenced the political rhetoric in Sofia. In 2022, a Bulgarian cultural center was attacked in the city of Ohrid, and, the following year, the authorities refused to register ethnic Bulgarian institutions as official cultural centers. In 2023, a young man who was allegedly attacked because of his Bulgarian identity did not receive any help from the police.\n\nNo Trust, No Friendship\n\nThere is a lack of political trust on both sides. Bulgaria and North Macedonia signed a \"good neighbor\" agreement in 2017, but divisions have deepened since then. In early 2024, President Pendarovski accused Sofia of continuously mistreating the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria, and said that it should also be recognized in the Bulgarian constitution. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said this made North Macedonia's EU membership a more distant prospect.\n\nBulgaria's constitution does not foresee the recognition of different ethnic groups, unlike North Macedonia's. Nor does the country allow the registering of ethnic political parties. Thus, for years, Bulgaria has refused to register the ethnic Macedonian organization OMO-Ilinden as a party. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled on several occasions that this violates the organization's rights of assembly and association, but the court also concluded that there was no violation of its rights when it comes to registration as a political party.\n\nThe recent fall of the coalition government in Bulgaria, meaning that in June the country will go to the polls for the sixth time in three years, adds to the unpredictability regarding the future of its relations with North Macedonia. There is certainly an essential need for a change of narratives in both countries and for rapprochement. Until this happens and the constitutional change is adopted in North Macedonia, the country's progress toward EU accession will continue to stagnate.\n\n...\n\nDimitar Keranov is a program assistant with the Engaging Central Europe program of The German Marshall Fund of the United States in Berlin.

Renowned as the \"Day of Courage of the Bulgarian Army,\" this holiday pays tribute to the valor and bravery exemplified by Saint George, a revered figure in both religious and cultural contexts.\n\nSaint George, recognized as Saint George the Victorious, was a Roman soldier martyred for his Christian faith. Legend has it that he bravely slayed a fearsome serpent near the city of Virit, symbolizing triumph over evil. In Bulgaria, St. George is venerated as a symbol of courage and resilience.\n\nThe association of St. George with bravery led to the designation of May 6th as the \"Day of Courage\" and the official celebration of the Bulgarian Army. Established by Prince (Knyaz) Battenberg in 1880, this holiday honors the gallant feats of soldiers and their unwavering commitment to defending the nation.\n\nOn January 1, 1880, Battenberg established the military order \"For Bravery.\" This distinction was created to recognize and reward acts of gallantry performed by soldiers on the battlefield, cementing courage as a cornerstone of Bulgaria's military ethos.\n\nOver the years, the Day of Courage has evolved into a solemn commemoration, marked by various rituals and ceremonies that honor the sacrifices made by Bulgarian soldiers in defense of their homeland. From memorial services for fallen heroes to military parades showcasing the nation's strength, the day serves as a poignant reminder of Bulgaria's military heritage and the resilience of its armed forces.\n\nDuring both times of peace and conflict, Bulgarian soldiers have exemplified unwavering courage and dedication to duty. Whether defending the nation's borders or contributing to international peacekeeping efforts, they have demonstrated a steadfast commitment to safeguarding Bulgaria's sovereignty and promoting stability in the region.\n\nToday, as Bulgaria navigates the complexities of modern geopolitics, the Day of Courage continues to hold profound significance. It serves as a moment of reflection on the sacrifices of the past and a source of inspiration for the challenges of the future. It is a day to honor the brave men and women who serve in the Bulgarian Army, as well as to reaffirm the nation's commitment to peace, security, and prosperity.\n\nThroughout history, the Day of Courage has been marked by solemn ceremonies, including memorial services for fallen heroes and military parades. It serves as a poignant reminder of Bulgaria's military heritage and the sacrifices made to safeguard its sovereignty. This year, however, there will be no military parade as the day coincides with the second day of Easter.\n\nTraditionally, the celebration of St. George's Day includes rituals and customs that reflect the nation's deep-rooted beliefs.\n\nSt. George's Day is a name day only for people with the names Georgi/George and Gergana and is the fifth most celebrated in Bulgaria, after Palm Sunday, St. John's Day, Archangel's Day and St. Stephen's Day, celebrated by 235,243 people as of 2017, according to NSI\n\nMoreover, this year the holiday coincides with Bright Monday, the second day of Easter, amplifying its significance in the Christian calendar. During this time, Bulgarians engage in religious observances and festivities, rejoicing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of new beginnings.", "source": {"uri": "novinite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Novinite.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_Land_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bulgarian Land Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saint George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bulgaria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint George's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bulgarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knyaz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knyaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ritual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacekeeping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacekeeping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Funeral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Stephen's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saint Stephen's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Sunday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Sunday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Monday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter Monday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archangel"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midsummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resurrection of Jesus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Revolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Revolution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2024-05/photo_verybig_225925.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544117", "eventUri": "eng-9544117", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

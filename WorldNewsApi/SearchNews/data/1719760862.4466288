{"id": 225027544, "title": "California Wants to Change the Law for Thousands of Migrants", "text": "More than 40,000 undocumented students at dozens of California college and university campuses will be provided work authorizations under a new law.On May 22, the California Assembly passed Bill 2586, known as the Opportunity for All Act, providing equal access to employment opportunities for all students, regardless of their immigration status, at the University of California (UC), California State University (CSU), and California Community Colleges (CCC) campuses.Legislation was introduced by State Representative David Alvarez, who said this new legislation will address inequities faced by undocumented students who have more difficulty financially supporting themselves as they complete their education. The bill passed 59-4, with 17 votes not recorded.\"America has always promised that if you work hard, you will have the opportunity to succeed,\" Alvarez said in a post-vote statement. \"These students have fulfilled their obligation and are ready to be our future teachers, scientists, doctors, and public servants. AB 2586 will provide them with the opportunity to work. Creating these pathways to secure employment is essential.\"Newsweek reached out for comment via email to Alvarez, along with all included colleges and universities.The law will affect roughly 45,000 students at the affected colleges and universities, which include 10 UC schools, 23 Cal State universities and 116 community colleges, according to The Orange County Register.They are required to implement the law by January 6, 2025.\"We wouldn't have to do this if the federal government actually did their job and passed immigration reform,\" Alvarez told CalMatters.Approximately 1.9 million immigrants statewide were undocumented in 2021, down from 2.8 million in 2007, according to Pew Research Center estimates published in November 2023. That represented a 28 percent decline compared to 2007, and 18 percent decline compared to 2021\u2014the latter when some 82 percent were either citizens or had some other legal residency status.In 2022, about 54 percent of California immigrants became naturalized citizens, continuing an upward trend since about 31 percent of immigrants were naturalized in 1990, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.AB 2586 prohibits the colleges and universities from disqualifying a student from being hired for an employment position due to their failure to provide proof of federal work authorization, \"except where that proof is required by federal law or where that proof is required as a condition of a grant that funds the particular employment position for which the student has applied.\"Alvarez and others, including those at the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy, have argued that Congress\u2014through federal legislation such as the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)\u2014and even colleges and universities themselves cannot prohibit undocumented students from working because they are part of state and not federal entities.\"In short, when Congress passed IRCA, Congress did not curtail states' historic power to determine the employment qualifications of state employees,\" reads a 2022 memo written by faculty co-directors at UCLA's Center for Immigration Law and PolicyIt continues: \"As a result, IRCA's prohibition on hiring undocumented persons does not bind state government entities. State entities can lawfully hire undocumented students irrespective of employment authorization status under federal law.\"", "summary": "\"Creating these pathways to secure employment is essential,\" said David Alvarez, bill sponsor in the California Assembly.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/migrants-california-colleges-undocumented-campus-1905766", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400524/cal-state.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:14:20", "author": "Nick Mordowanec", "authors": ["Nick Mordowanec"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.125}

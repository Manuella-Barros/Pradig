It hurts him.\"\n\nJelly Roll later told Variety that it \"wasn't just bullying\" that led him to leave social media.\n\n\"It was not only the toxicity of social media, but the addiction of it,\" he told the outlet. \"I was becoming too busy to waste hours of my life scrolling. I can honestly say that I've been off social media for a few months now and I've never felt better or healthier mentally -- never felt more clearheaded.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jelly Roll completes 5K after weight loss: 'Really emotional'", "source": {"uri": "ca.style.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "5K run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Half marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_2_Bears", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The 2 Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sauna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lumberjack", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Jams,_Jellies,_and_Preserves", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Jams, Jellies, and Preserves", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tobacco/Cigarettes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/o5lxeuKzh4GaZAC2cVvkeg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_entertainment_893/ad657f415ea551705d46e758a63b687e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548012", "eventUri": "eng-9548012", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

And showing no signs of slowing down, the hitmaker continues to showcase not just his love for country music, but for his wife, Bunnie Xo. Although a top name in country music, Jelly Roll removed himself from social media due to people jabbing him about his weight. Not putting much stock into what the trolls have to say, the singer recently proved the naysayers wrong when he completed his first 5k with a special surprise from his wife.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nSince January, Jelly Roll documented his commitment to losing weight for his first 5k. On Tuesday, that hard work paid off when he crossed the finish line for the 2 Bears 5K at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California alongside Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura. Even Bunnie Xo participated in the race as she shared videos on her Instagram Stories. But while crossing the finish line was a massive milestone for the singer, the real reward was when his wife decided to jump into a cold plunge tub with Jelly Roll. And to make it even better, Bunnie Xo congratulated him with a good kiss.\n\n[RELATED: Watch Jelly Roll and Bunnie Xo Party Like Rockstars During Nickelback Performance]\n\nJelly Roll Discusses His Weight Loss\n\nBack in April, Jelly Roll discussed training for the event, telling People, \"I've been really kicking ass, man.

From visiting the prison where he spent time to honoring veterans at his shows to inspiring aspiring artists (and the world at large) with his full throttle acceptance speeches, the guy has no doubt put in the work and deserves all of the success that's been flowing his way over the past few years and he's got a drink on me if I ever get the pleasure of meeting him.\n\nBut despite all the headlines and sold out shows, there's one thing Jelly has always struggled with and it finally caught up with him mentally not that long ago.\n\nIt's no secret Jelly is a big guy and the comments about his weight got so bad that he was forced to stop using social media, but instead of having that be a shutdown moment, he decided to let it fuel him and make a change.\n\nJelly Roll made the decision to run a 5k a few months ago at the request of comedians Bert Kreischer and Tom Segura and got to work almost immediately. He met with bio hacker Gary Brecka to develop a plan to lose an astounding 250 pounds in 14 months and kept up with his diet and workout routine to prepare for race day, which was yesterday.\n\nTrue to his word, Jelly Roll finished the 5k and then spoke with Entertainment Tonight about the experience:\n\n\"I couldn't walk a mile when I started trying to do this back in January so the fact that we got 3-point-whatever it was, got it down, I felt really, really good about it... I feel great, I'm a little tired, It was a little bit harder than I thought it was going to be, but it's awesome, man.\"\n\nHats off to Jelly Roll. It's so hard to get in a habit of working out and taking care of yourself if you've never done it and being an artist with a heavy touring schedule only adds to the difficulty, so the fact that he's been able to lose 50lbs and finish a 5k just a few months removed from not being able to walk a mile really needs to be celebrated.\n\nWell, Jelly Roll's wife certainly realized how big of a moment it was and celebrated with him at the end like the proud, supportive spouse she is.\n\nBunnie Xo, who at this point is nearly as big of a star as Jelly himself, (I mean, talk about a power couple) posted a video to Instagram showing Jelly taking a recovery ice bath after the race, and after a big of coaxing, decided to hop in and join her man.\n\n\"What a beautiful day w/ beautiful ppl! So proud of my baby doing the 5k & losing 50 lbs to do it!\"\n\nIf you've never hopped in a cold plunge or ice bath you may not realize just how cold it is; Imagine swimming under the ice in a frozen lake and you'll get the picture. As I said up top, my wife really does support me in a lot of things but there's a less than zero chance she'd hop in an ice bath with me, so it just goes to show how much Bunnie really cares about him.\n\nThings like this always get me fired up and I'm very proud of Jelly for starting his \"fitness journey\" as the influencers say.

I want someone who's not afraid to tell the truth in a graceful way...\n\nSo just someone who has a strong sense of self that listens to their intuition.\"\n\nSounds like a pretty strong endorsement.\n\nOf course the question remained, was Jelly Roll even interested in the job? And the answer is an enthusiastic \"Yes.\"\n\nJelly Roll was recently asked during an interview with KFRG's Kelli & Guy on Audacy about the possibility of joining the lineup on Idol, and it sounds like he'd jump at the chance to replace Katy Perry on the show:\n\n\"Of course, I love American Idol. I've accepted the job and they haven't offered it.\"\n\nOf course Jelly may be a natural choice for the show now that he has experience on Idol.

However, the CMA New Artist of the Year isn't one to rest on his laurels. He's currently gearing up to start the next chapter of his career with some new music. Recently, he took to social media to share a clip of a new track called \"Liar\" with his followers.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\n\"Liar\" seems to see Jelly Roll addressing someone who is throwing dirt on his name. However, he refuses to let their negative intentions keep him down. Instead, he plans to keep climbing higher. It's easy to see where he found inspiration for the song. While he's an award-winning performer and many country fans love him and his music, that love isn't universal. After all, he decided to step away from social media due in part to the toxic comments he received.\n\n[RELATED: Jelly Roll Tests Fiery Unreleased Song at Grand Ole Opry]\n\nThe video caught the attention of -- and garnered praise from -- many of Jelly Roll's fans. His biggest fan and wife, Bunnie Xo, jokingly commented on the video, \"Are you talking about me, sir?\" The comment got hundreds of replies but none of them were from Jelly. This is likely because they both know the answer already.\n\nJelly Roll Prepares for the Next Chapter of His Career\n\nRecently Jelly Roll appeared on the Country Heat Weekly podcast. During his conversation with hosts Amber Anderson and Kelly Sutton, he said that he's ready to release new music. \"I haven't said this publicly, alluded to it at the [CMT Music Awards] but God willing going into the [ACM Awards], we'll begin the new chapter,\" he revealed. \"I think the Whitsitt Chapel era ended at the [CMT Awards],\" he added.\n\n[RELATED: Jelly Roll Says He's Ready for the \"Next Chapter\" of His Career, Discusses New Music]\n\n\"It's the longest chapter I've wrote, ever, maybe in my career,\" he said of the next phase of his journey. \"I wrote a hundred-and-something songs last year. I don't know how many of them I'm actually going to release this year,\" he explained. \"Last year, I did a really tight, small package with Whitsitt Chapel. I told my wife I'm fighting the urge to start getting on TikTok like an artist that never made it and start dropping songs and see what goes,\" he added. \"I have that many songs.\"\n\nIt looks like he lost the fight to that urge.

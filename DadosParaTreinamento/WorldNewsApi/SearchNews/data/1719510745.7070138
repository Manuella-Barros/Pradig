{"id": 223676090, "title": "Five changes to get 'silent killer' high blood pressure down before it's too late", "text": "High blood pressure - often dubbed the 'silent killer' - is a major concern in the UK with approximately half of the population never having their levels checked. It's believed that around four million Brits could be suffering from undiagnosed hypertension, which can lead to deadly heart attacks, kidney disease, and vascular dementia if left untreated. The Times has highlighted five lifestyle adjustments that could help lower your blood pressure within just three months. Earlier this year, the NHS launched the Get Your Blood Pressure Checked campaign, stressing that high blood pressure often shows no obvious symptoms, making regular checks vital. Health Minister Andrea Leadsom said: \"Millions of adults in England unknowingly have high blood pressure, without experiencing any symptoms. As part of our Pharmacy First programme, the NHS has expanded its pharmacy offering to include 2.5 million more blood pressure checks within local pharmacies. \"Knowing if you have a healthy blood pressure is so important and this new drive will help to prevent the potentially fatal consequences of untreated high blood pressure. I urge people to go to their local pharmacy today to get their blood pressure checked. It could be a life-saving trip.\" High blood pressure can be deadly, with a top doctor warning it can increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Dr Oliver Guttmann told The Times: \"High blood pressure can damage arteries in the back of the eye, resulting in blurred vision and sight problems. Over time it can also harm blood vessels so that blood flow to organs such as the kidneys is reduced, potentially causing long-term damage.\", The consultant cardiologist, who works at Barts Health NHS Trust and the HCA Wellington Hospital, explained: \"Although there can be a genetic influence, too many of us eat too much salt and ultra-processed foods, drink too much alcohol or do too little exercise, all of which are risky for our blood pressure.\" And if Brits want to get their blood pressure under control, there are five top tips they can try over a three month period - including doing planks, reports Gloucestershire Live. Some exercises are more beneficial for blood pressure, though all physical activity is advantageous. Isometric holds, such as plank positions, low squats, and wall sits, are particularly effective. Dr Jamie O'Driscoll, an expert in cardiovascular physiology at Canterbury Christ Church University, explained the unique benefits: \"When you release an isometric hold, there is a sudden increase in blood flow as the blood vessels dilate again,\" he noted. \"You don't get the same effect with other forms of exercise.\" Running was ranked second by Dr O'Driscoll, who highlighted its dual benefits: \"improves blood pressure and also your body's ability to utilise oxygen\", crucial for warding off heart disease. Incorporating potassium-rich foods into your diet can also aid in lowering blood pressure. Foods like bananas, lentils, potatoes, avocados, dates, leafy greens, and more are packed with potassium. Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert, author of The Science of Nutrition, emphasized potassium's role: \"Potassium plays a role in blood pressure control. It does this by helping the body to remove salt from the bloodstream.\" Ensuring adequate sleep is another vital step towards maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Less than seven hours of sleep could potentially result in high blood pressure, according to researchers. In a presentation at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session in March, data from over a million people devoid of any hypertension history was examined. The findings associated less than seven hours of regular sleep with a seven per cent rise in blood pressure - and the risk spiked to 11 per cent for those who usually slept for five hours or even less. Alongside planks, wall sits were credited for their effectiveness in combating high blood pressure. As Dr O'Driscoll suggested: \"Don't feel you have to go in with a 90-degree angle at the knees. Better to widen the knee angle and to hold for two minutes at a time than to shorten the duration of the exercise.\" His research hints that an eight-minute workout -- consisting of four sets of two-minute isometric holds interrupted by two minutes of rest - thrice weekly can significantly ward off hypertension. Opting for stretching exercises or dedicating half an hour to yoga also comes highly recommended. Research has indicated that regular stretching can help to reduce blood pressure by decreasing stiffness in blood vessels, thereby reducing resistance to blood flow. A study published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health saw researchers from the University of Saskatchewan in Canada asking individuals with mild hypertension to incorporate either a brisk daily walk or 30 minutes of stretching larger muscles such as the quadriceps and hamstrings into their routine five days a week.", "summary": "It is estimated that around four million people are suffering from hypertension but they don't know it - and there are five changes to make to get your blood pressure down in just three months", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/five-changes-silent-killer-high-32859838", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32712267.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Ensuring-her-vitals-are-nominal-before-the-procedure.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:24:40", "author": "Ben Hurst,Rom Preston-Ellis,Rom-preston-ellis", "authors": ["Ben Hurst", "Rom Preston-Ellis", "Rom-preston-ellis"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.02}

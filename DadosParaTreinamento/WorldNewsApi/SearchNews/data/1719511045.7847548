She wants out of her 'Mucky Mansion' after vandals targeted her property, throwing acid on her car, she said. The 45-year-old, previously known as Jordan, has starred in many TV shows from her home - now it has become a target. She said despite it being \"private property\" there have been \"scumbags\" accessing her land. Katie, who previously said she had had enough of drama round her home, took to Instagram to vent her frustration, sharing a video of her damaged pink Range Rover and stating: \"It's nice to know someone in the night has come to throw acid all over my car, everywhere, all on my car. Thank you whoever that was.\" Read more: People love Nadine Coyle's skirt She also added a caption to the video, which read: \"Scumbags outside my house on my private property. I can't wait get out of this house in a few months' time.\" This incident follows closely after Katie received a parking ticket on the same vehicle while she was busy recording a podcast in south London. Her new beau, Married At First Sight's JJ Slater, was keeping watch outside but was taken aback to find a glaring yellow 'Penalty Charge Notice' tucked into the windscreen wipers. JJ, 31, appeared downcast as he was photographed standing by the roadside in casual attire. Katie, who began dating him following her split from former fiance Carl Woods, has been seen looking more content than ever despite their 14-year age difference, reports the Mirror. The mother of five, who has been married three times, and JJ have been discussing marriage and children even though they've only been together for half a year, and they've already gone as far as getting matching tattoos. Whilst her love life may be flourishing, Katie validated earlier this week that she must vacate her cherished Horsham residence in West Sussex, famously nicknamed Mucky Mansion down the line. The news follows The Mirror's report indicating the ex-glamour model was issued an eviction notice on her abode after a bankruptcy declaration over a remaining \u00a3750,000 tax bill. Horsham County Court has provided her lenders with eviction orders demanding that she leave her current home by the end of this month, allowing the property to be sold and utilised to pay off some of her outstanding debts. Katie petitioned the court for an audience where she could request continued residency at her home. However, the mother of five has only been granted a few days to leave the property. A further notice, dated 3rd May 2024, emerged outside the model's house, cautioning her that she faced imminent seizure of her property if no action was taken. Despite previous affirmations that nobody could oust her from her Mucky Mansion and rebutting claims of intending to relocate to a caravan, Katie has currently expressed that she \"can't wait\" to depart after calling the mansion home for nine years. She mentioned harbouring \"nothing but bad memories\" during her tenancy there. Katie expressed her disdain for the infamous 'Mucky Mansion', saying: \"I absolutely hate the Mucky Mansion, even how it's been called the Mucky Mansion because of all the stuff that happened there before. I can't wait to get out of that house. I've had nothing but bad memories in that house for nine years.. I hate the Mucky Mansion, I never want to see it again and I can't wait to move into my new place, I am so excited.\" Stay updated with Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Threads.", "summary": "Katie Price has been left fuming as she revealed vandals had broken into her Mucky Mansion and 'thrown acid' at her pink Range Rover", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/showbiz-tv/katie-price-wants-out-mucky-29242835", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/showbiz-tv/article29148978.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_katie-prices-mucky-mansion-s1-generics.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:39:39", "author": "Jordan Coussins,Katie Wilson", "authors": ["Jordan Coussins", "Katie Wilson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.001}

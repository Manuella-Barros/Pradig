When the three-day event kicks off on Thursday, June 13, there will be a dizzying choice of more than 150 brews \u2013 ranging from lush lagers to incredible IPA, brilliant Belgians to summertime ciders. The announcement of the final beer list has been a hugely-anticipated milestone for the celebration of beer, food and music, said Happening organiser Robert Lindsay: \u201cWe have been inundated with messages from people asking when the final list of participating breweries and they beers they will be bringing will be announced \u2013 so here it is,\u201d he said. And we are sure people will be delighted by what we are offering this year, leaning heavily into the best of Scottish breweries \u2013 but with a Belgian accent too, with our guest brewers from the Continent.\u201d In total, 23 breweries and cider makers will be taking part in the festival, and 153 unique beers will be on offer over the weekend. The Scottish contingent includes favourites among Scottish beer connoisseurs, such as Fyne Ales, Fierce, Cromarty and Six Degrees North \u2013 the latter founded by Robert himself. The Belgian breweries arriving are De Circus Brouwerji \u2013 as the name suggest it is a modern microbrewery with a circus theme \u2013 and Alvinne who specialise in sours and fruit beers. Robert said: \u201cWe will have everything from hoppy IPAs bursting with flavour to the lush, velvet smoothness of quality Belgian beers transforming our marquee into a playground for beer lovers. All of these have been carefully curated by festival team and range from old favourites to some new discoveries to be made. Visitors aren\u2019t the only ones excited about what\u2019s on offer \u2013 we are, too!\u201d Alongside the beer list, the Midsummer Beer Happening is hitting the high notes on the music front, too, with a symphony of north-east artists providing the soundtrack to three days of fun. \u201cFrom blues to folk, rock to pipes and drums, we are going to have almost every genre of music entertaining visitors to the Happening,\u201d said Robert. \u201cFrom chilled out music for a Saturday afternoon to dance-floor filling sounds for the end of the night, we have you covered.\u201d Robert said that tickets for the Happening are being snapped up and urged people to make sure they book a place now, to ensure they don\u2019t miss out on the great bears, fantastic music and tasty street food. \u201cThere are so many strands that are woven into making the Happening magical, but the most important golden thread are the people who come along to have a great time. None of it Happens without them, so thanks in advance for your support,\u201d he said. As always, the not-for-profit event, run entirely by volunteers, will raise money for a slew of local charities, adding to the incredible \u00a3314,000 it has raised for good causes since it began as the Stonehaven Real Ale Festival 15 years ago. \u201cOur ethos is to help people have a good time and do some good for others while they are having fun. We really believe that spirit of everyone pulling together to give back is what has cemented the Midsummer Beer Happening as one of the most popular events in the north-east calendar,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us are looking forward to welcoming you in a fortnight.

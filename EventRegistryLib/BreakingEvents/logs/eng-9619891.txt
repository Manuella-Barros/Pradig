Nikhil issued Dalljiet a legal notice citing violations of Indian laws regarding social media posts accusing him of an extramarital affair.Bigg Boss 13's Dalljiet Kaur and her estranged husband, Kenya-based businessman Nikhil Patel, have recently made headlines. A few days ago, Dalljiet posted some cryptic messages on Instagram, suggesting that Nikhil had been involved in an extramarital affair. In response, Nikhil confirmed the end of their relationship. Now, the latest update is that Nikhil has issued Dalljiet a legal notice.\n\nUnder the Indian Penal Code, The Information Technology Act of 2000 (India), and The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012 (India), Dalljiet Kaur's constant posts on social media accusing her husband of extra-marital affair are on the wrong side of the law. According to Nikhil it can potentially give rise to civil and criminal proceedings against her.\n\nTalking about the same, Nikhil stated, \"As a normal citizen of the world, It is very disturbing to see how the gaps in online protection laws both in India and globally can, and are, often exploited by those who choose to gain cheap media attention through careless actions that place innocent children and women at risk. Sharing pictures and video footage without consent of those involved, particularly in the case of children, who are always a vulnerable group in society and who always require protection of the law, is illegal and negligent.\"\n\nNikhil also states that his team has reached out to Dalljiet to take her remaining belongings in June, otherwise they will be given away to a much needed charity in Kenya as he has no obligation to store them for her and has requested her on several occasions to collect them.\n\nAccording to Nikhil, his legal team have made it very clear that they will not tolerate any further harassment going forward, and will take the sternest legal action available against Dalljiet should she continue with her unlawful actions.\n\nEarlier, in a statement, Nikhil had shared, \"Dalljiet informed me, her son's school, and others on the day she decided to leave that she did not plan to return to Kenya, except to collect her remaining belongings. I have safely stored these belongings for her. Her departure marked the end of our relationship for me, and despite her concerning social media activity over the past five months, I have found closure and solace, moving forward positively. However, Dalljiet's recent assumptions and impulsive posts on social media have caused confusion and distress among those around me. She has expressed a desire to return to my life and has crossed boundaries. Her posts have been misinterpreted, resulting in unnecessary harassment of family and friends unrelated to this situation. I hope she stops this behavior.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalljiet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalljiet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigg_Boss_(Hindi_season_13)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bigg Boss (Hindi season 13)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110655094,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-141194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619891", "eventUri": "eng-9619891", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 234, "relevance": 1}

Responding to these accusations, Nikhil Patel, a Kenya-based businessman who married Dalljiet in Mumbai in March 2023, has threatened legal action. Speaking to ETimes, Nikhil revealed that he has issued a written cease and desist letter to Dalljiet, warning her to stop her \"unlawful actions.\" He emphasized that his legal team is prepared to take the sternest legal measures against her if she continues with the harassment.\n\nNikhil Patel threatens legal action over Dalljiet Kaur's 'cheap' posts\n\nNikhil expressed his frustration over the misuse of online platforms for gaining media attention at the expense of innocent parties. He stated, \"As a normal citizen of the world, it is very disturbing to see how the gaps in online protection laws, both in India and globally, can, and are, often exploited by those who choose to gain cheap media attention through careless actions that place innocent children and women at risk.\" He further criticized the sharing of private pictures and video footage without consent, labelling it illegal and negligent, especially when children are involved.\n\nThe controversy escalated after Dalljiet shared and quickly deleted their wedding video on Instagram. Nikhil has also reached out to Dalljiet to retrieve her belongings from his home in Kenya by June, failing which he plans to donate them to charity. He clarified that he has no obligation to store her items and has repeatedly requested her to collect them.\n\nRecently, Nikhil confirmed their separation and addressed the extramarital affair allegations in an interview with ETimes, stating that Dalljiet decided to leave Kenya with her son Jaydon in January, which led to their separation. He explained, \"We both realised that the foundation of our blended family wasn't as strong as we had hoped, making it hard for Dalljiet to settle in Kenya. In March 2023, we held an Indian wedding ceremony in Mumbai. Though it held cultural significance, it was not legally binding. This ceremony was intended to reassure Dalljiet's family about her move to Kenya.\"\n\nThe divorce rumours began circulating in February 2024 after the couple unfollowed each other and deleted several posts from their Instagram accounts. Dalljiet further fuelled the speculation by posting a poll on Instagram Stories asking, \"What's your thought on extramarital affairs? Who is to be blamed?\" with options like 'The girl,' 'The husband,' and 'The wife.' This move added to the already heated public discourse surrounding their relationship.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, it remains to be seen how Dalljiet and Nikhil will resolve their differences, both personally and legally. The public and their fans watch closely as the drama continues to play out on social media and in legal forums.\n\nAlso Read: Nikhil Patel CONFIRMS separation with Dalljiet Kaur; REACTS to extra-marital affair allegations: \"She has expressed a desire to return to my life and has crossed boundaries\"\n\nTags : Dalljiet Kaur, Divorce, Features, Indian Television, ITV, Legal action, Nikhil Patel, Seperation, Television, TV\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES\n\nCatch us for latest Bollywood News, New Bollywood Movies update, Box office collection, New Movies Release , Bollywood News Hindi, Entertainment News, Bollywood Live News Today & Upcoming Movies 2024 and stay updated with latest hindi movies only on Bollywood Hungama.", "source": {"uri": "bollywoodhungama.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bollywood Hungama"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bollywood_hungama@bollywoodhungama.com", "name": "Bollywood Hungama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalljiet_Kaur", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dalljiet Kaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood_Hungama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bollywood Hungama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media5.bollywoodhungama.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Nikhil-Patel-threatens-legal-action-over-Dalljiet-Kaurs-cheap-posts-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619891", "eventUri": "eng-9619891", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Days after Dalljiet posted and then deleted their wedding videos, Nikhil has sent her a Cease & Desist letter. A release by the businessman's PR read, \"Under the Indian Penal Code, The Information Technology Act of 2000 (India), and The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012 (India), Dalljiet Kaur's erratic, cheap and tacky bid to gain media attention is likely to place her on the wrong side of the law and can potentially give rise to civil and criminal proceedings against her.\"\n\nIn the recent statement, Nikhil states \"As a normal citizen of the world, it is very disturbing to see how the gaps in online protection laws both in India and globally can, and are, often exploited by those who choose to gain cheap media attention through careless actions that place innocent children and women at risk.

His legal team has stated they will not tolerate further harassment and will take the \"sternest legal action available against Dalljiet\" if she continues with what they describe as \"unlawful actions.\"\n\nRecently, Dalljiet shared and then deleted a wedding video on Instagram, hinting at Nikhil's alleged extramarital affairs through a poll on her stories. Nikhil has expressed frustration over Dalljiet's social media activities, which he claims involve his family members and cause them distress. He told ETimes, \"It is very disturbing to see how the gaps in online protection laws both in India and globally are exploited by those seeking cheap media attention.

However, their relationship has taken a turn for the worse, leaving fans and followers in shock and confusion.\n\nThe Cease And Desist Letter\n\nIn response to the allegations made by Dalljiet Kaur, her estranged husband, Nikhil Patel, has taken significant legal steps. He issued a \"cease and desist letter\" to Dalljiet, warning her to stop her \"unlawful actions.\" Nikhil has threatened to initiate legal proceedings in response to Dalljiet's social media posts accusing him of having an extramarital affair.\n\nHis legal team has contacted Dalljiet to collect her remaining belongings by June, and if she does not, the items will be donated to a charity in Kenya. Nikhil has made it clear that he will not tolerate any further harassment and will take stern legal action if Dalljiet continues with her \"unlawful actions.\"\n\nThe Beginning Of The End\n\nThe first signs of conflict appeared in February 2024 when Dalljiet returned to India from Kenya.

She expressed her disappointment and humiliation, leaving fans in shock. This was a significant departure from her previous posts, filled with love and admiration for Nikhil.\n\nNikhil's Response\n\nNikhil addressed the allegations, stating that cultural clashes, different values, and beliefs led to the challenges in their marriage. He also mentioned that Dalljiet found adjusting to life in Kenya challenging, missing her career and life in India.\n\nThese cultural clashes included differences in their family, career, and personal life approaches.

This ceremony was intended to reassure Dalljiet's family about her move to Kenya.\"\n\n\"Despite our efforts, Dalljiet found it challenging to adjust to life in Kenya, missing her career and life in India. The complexities of our family dynamics became increasingly apparent,\" he added.\n\nThis was Dalljiet Kaur's second marriage.

Subsequently, he issued a legal restraining notice to her. Scroll down to find more details.\n\nHe articulated that if Dalljiet continues on her illegal path, his lawyers are fully prepared to take the harshest legal actions against her. Nikhil added, \"As a normal citizen of the world, it is very disturbing to see how the gaps in online protection laws, both in India and globally, can, and are, often exploited by those who choose to gain cheap media attention through careless actions that place innocent children and women at risk (sic).\"\n\nHe further added, \"Sharing pictures and video footage without consent of those involved, particularly in the case of children, who are always a vulnerable group in society and who always require protection of the law, is illegal and negligent (sic).\"\n\nNikhil subtly pointed out the wedding recording he had once shared on Instagram but then took down. He conveyed that his team got in touch with Dalljiet aiming to recover her stuff from his residence in Kenya by the month of June, or else they would be given away for charity. Nikhil insisted on his lack of obligation to hold on to her possessions and had sought her repeatedly to gather them.\n\nGossip started circulating about the possible split of a certain estranged couple in the second month of 2024 - it all began when they unfriended each other online and purged their social media profiles of any traces of their past.

Prior to that, there had been 14 consecutive base rate hikes since December 2021.\n\nFive members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted to hold the base rate at 5.25 per cent, while four voted to lower it to 5 per cent.\n\nWe explain why the Bank of England has cut interest rate rises and what it means for your mortgage, savings and the wider economy.\n\nFinally: The Bank of England today cut the base rate from 5.25% to 5%\n\nWhy has the bank cut rates?\n\nToday's base rate decision was a hard one to call. Markets were divided over whether the cut would come today or at the next meeting in September.\n\nThe aim of increasing the base rate in the first place, and then holding it for the best part of a year, was to reduce the rate of inflation.\n\nInflation peaked at 11.1 per cent in October 2022 and this has led to higher costs in many areas of household spending including energy bills and food shopping.\n\nBy raising the cost of borrowing for individuals and businesses, the Bank of England hoped to reduce demand, slowing the flow of new money into the economy.\n\nMore expensive mortgages and better savings rates encourage people to save more and spend less, further pushing down inflation.\n\nThe Bank of England will argue that the plan has worked with inflation remaining at 2 per cent in the 12 months to June.\n\nInflation watch: Inflation hit the Bank of England's 2% target in May. This was the first time since July 2021 that inflation had reached this level\n\nPeter Stimson, head of product at the mortgage lender MPowered said: 'After months of nods, winks and speculation, the Bank of England has finally begun to ease its monetary policy squeeze.\n\n'The primary reason for this is that consumer inflation is stabilising, and has been bang on the Bank's 2 per cent target for two months in a row.\n\n'But the second reason is that the Bank's high interest rate policy - which makes mortgages more expensive and slows consumer spending - is holding back economic growth and the Bank wants to remove the handbrake.'\n\nWhat next for interest rates?\n\nAt present, markets are pricing in one further rate cut in 2024. If forecasts are correct, this could mean base rate will fall to 4.75 by the end of 2024.\n\nLooking even further ahead, financial markets are forecasting that base rate will fall to around 4 per cent by the end of next year before eventually settling at around 3.5 per cent.\n\nNo dramatic cuts forecast: The base rate is not expected to return to the rock bottom levels seen in 2021/22\n\nSome economists are slightly more bullish. For example, Capital Economics is predicting base rate will fall to 3 per cent by the end of next year.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief economist at Capital Economics said: 'If we are right in thinking inflation will be weaker than the Bank expects, then we still think rates will be cut to 3 per cent next year, rather than to 4 per cent as investors anticipate.'\n\nOthers believe the Bank of England should have begun cutting interest rates sooner.\n\nEconomists at The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) think the Bank of England has not responded quickly enough to slowing inflation or the UK's sluggish growth rates.\n\nAndrew Lilico, IEA Economics Fellow, said: 'Inflation is likely to undershoot the target by some margin over the next eighteen months.\n\n'Unnecessarily tight policy will impede the economy just as new investment is needed to take best advantage of emerging new technologies. A rate cut is well overdue.'\n\nAbout to fall? Capital Economics is forecasting that the Bank of England will cut base rate all the way to 3% by the end of 2025\n\nWhat does this mean for mortgage borrowers?\n\nIn reality, the base rate cut serves as more of a symbolic moment for mortgage holders, rather than one that will make any meaningful difference.\n\nThis is because future base rate cuts are already largely baked into fixed rate mortgage pricing and means borrowers won't notice much difference when it comes to their mortgage rates - even with further base rate cuts down the line.\n\nRobert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide Building Society said: 'Investors expect bank rate to be lowered modestly in the years ahead, which, if correct, will help to bring down borrowing costs.\n\n'However, the impact is likely to be fairly modest as the swap rates which underpin fixed-rate mortgage pricing already embody expectations that interest rates will decline in the years ahead.\n\n'Affordability is likely to improve only gradually through a combination of wage growth outpacing house price growth, which is expected to remain fairly flat, with some support from modestly lower borrowing costs.'\n\nThe bulk of outstanding residential mortgages are fixed rate and for the vast majority of these people, the base rate change won't have any immediate impact.\n\nHow much can you afford?\n\nFind out how much you can afford to borrow for a monthly payment amount with This is Money's mortgage affordability calculator.\n\nThe mortgage borrowers who stand to benefit the most are those on tracker and variable rates.\n\nVariable rate mortgages include 'discount' rates and also standard variable rates (SVRs). Monthly payments on all these types of loan can go up or down.\n\nTracker rates follow the Bank of England's base rate plus a set percentage, for example base rate plus 0.75 per cent. They often come without early repayment charges, allowing people to switch whenever they like without incurring a penalty.\n\nStandard variable rates are lenders' default rates that people tend to move on to if their fixed or other deal period ends and they do not remortgage on to a new deal.\n\nThese can be changed by lenders at any time, and will usually rise and fall when the base rate does - but they can go up or down by more or less than the Bank of England's move.\n\nAccording to Moneyfacts, the average SVR is 8.16 per cent, up from an average of 4.4 per cent in December 2021 when base rate was just 0.1 per cent - but it will vary from lender to lender.\n\nAs for those on fixed rates, there are around 700,000 fixed-rate deals due to end in the second half of this year, according to UK Finance.\n\nFixed mortgage rates have already been moving downwards in recent weeks, with the cheapest five-year fix dipping below 4 per cent for the first time since February.\n\nBig lenders such as Nationwide, HSBC, Halifax and Barclays have been trying to undercut one another to compete for new customers.\n\nHeading down again? In recent weeks mortgage lenders have been cutting rates\n\nDespite the flurry of rate cuts, mortgage rates remain much higher than what most borrowers are used to.\n\nAnyone coming to the end of a cheaper fixed rate deal this year and needing to remortgage could be in for a financial shock, given many borrowers are rolling off deals of 2 per cent or less.\n\nEven so, they have come down substantially from highs reached last summer.\n\nThis time last year, the average two-year and five-year fixed rates were 6.86 per cent and 6.35 per cent respectively.\n\nThe average two-year fixed mortgage rate is now 5.78 per cent, according to Moneyfacts, and the average five-year fix is 5.39 per cent.\n\nAndrew Hagger, personal finance expert and founder of MoneyComms says the cut in interest rates will be a welcome relief to mortgage holders on a variable rate\n\nAndrew Hagger, personal finance expert at MoneyComms said: 'Many consumers continue to struggle to make ends meet, so a cut in interest rates will be a welcome relief to mortgage holders on a variable rate.\n\n'For those currently on a fixed rate home loan, the financial benefit won't be felt immediately but it should make life a little less painful when they next come to review their fixed deal.\n\n'People will be hoping this is the first of a series of cuts in the next 6-12 months, especially as inflation appears to be back under control.'\n\nNicholas Mendes, mortgage technical manager at broker John Charcol added: 'Today's bank rate reduction announcement is a positive step for the property and mortgage market, marking the first interest rate cut in over four years finally kick-starting the downward bank rate cycle.\n\n'Positivity spreads quickly and while today's rate cut would have already been priced in, this will undoubtedly revitalise activity.\n\n'Mortgage holders nearing the end of their fixed-rate period and prospective buyers can now make informed decisions with greater confidence, rather than delaying and speculating.'\n\nWhat next for fixed rate mortgages?\n\nMortgage borrowers on fixed term deals should focus less on the base rate decision today, and more about where markets are forecasting the base rate to go in the future.\n\nThis is because banks change their fixed mortgage rates pre-emptively, on the back of predictions about where the base rate will ultimately be in the future.\n\nThis is why the cheapest mortgage rates are around 1 percentage point below the base rate.\n\nMarket interest rate expectations are reflected in swap rates. These swap rates are influenced by long-term market projections for the Bank of England base rate, as well as the wider economy, internal bank targets and competitor pricing.\n\nAs of 29 July, two-year swap rates are at 4.26 per cent. The same time last year, they were at 5.49 per cent.\n\nFive-year swaps are currently at 3.78 per cent, down from 4.75 per cent 12 months ago.\n\nThe lowest two-year and five-year fixed mortgage rates currently available are trending just above the equivalent swaps.\n\nThe lowest five-year fix is 3.99 per cent and the lowest two-year fix is 4.42 per cent.\n\nIt is very rare for the lowest priced fixed mortgage rates to go below swap rates, though it did happen in January 2024 for a very short period of time.\n\nPrior to the quick-fire base rate rises between December 2021 and August 2023, the lowest mortgage rates have trended above base rate. That was the case at least between 2008 and 2022.\n\nThis means that even if the base rate settles at between 3 per and 4 per cent, we should expect mortgage rates to be higher than that.\n\nThe view among market commentators is that rates are unlikely to change much - at least for now.\n\nPeter Stimson of MPowered Mortgages added: 'Provided inflation stays under control, the Bank could reduce the base rate further later this year.\n\n'While most analysts are predicting that there could be two Base Rate reductions this year, there are no guarantees and no-one should expect rates to return to the very low levels we got used to in the 2010s.\n\n'The other thing to remember is that today's Base Rate cut won't instantly translate into every mortgage lender cutting their interest rates.'\n\nAndrew Hagger adds: 'Rates for home owners will remain fairly flat although there has been some trimming of prices in recent days by some of the larger UK lenders with a 0.25 per cent cut seemingly being priced in already.'\n\nWhat does the base rate cut mean for savers?\n\nThe Bank of England's decision today to cut the base rate by 0.25 bps to 5 per cent marks the first time the bank of England has opted to cut the base rate since 2020.\n\nIt follows seven consecutive occasions in which the bank voted to hold rates at 5.25 per centbetween August 2023 and June 2024.\n\nPrior to that, there had been 14 consecutive base rate hikes since December 2021.\n\nThe Bank of England's successive interest rate rises between December 2021 and August 2023 were, by and large, very good news for savers.\n\nSavers might now see this as a death knell for the savings rate heyday.\n\nBank of England base rate hikes between December 2021 and August 2023 meant savers benefitted from high savings rates\n\nThe fact of the matter is that savings rates have been falling even while the Base Rate was held at 5.25 per cent .\n\nRates have been volatile over the last six months despite there being no change to the Bank of England base rate as providers have priced in base rate cuts.\n\nPrevious headline-grabbing deals including Santander's 5.2 per cent special edition easy-access rate and NS&I's one-year bond paying 6.2 per cent, which launched in September 2023, have all but vanished.\n\nSavings accounts across the board have taken a hit. The best one-year fixed-rate account on the market now pays 5.4 per cent, down from a high of 6.2 per cent in October 2023.\n\nSavers should take some comfort that at least 1,638 savings accounts available still beat inflation which is now at the Bank of England's target of 2 per cent.\n\nThis is crucial because it means the value of your money is not falling in real terms.\n\nEasy-access rates have fared slightly better and held steady, falling less sharply than their fixed-rate counterparts.\n\nThe best easy-access rate pays 5.04 per cent, down from a high of 5.2 per cent in January.\n\nSince the start of December 2023, the average easy-access savings rate has fallen from 3.18 per cent to 3.12 per cent and the average easy access Isa rate stands at 3.31 per cent, as it did six months ago.\n\nOne area of the market to thrive over recent months has been cash Isas.\n\nSavers rushed to pour a record \u00a311.7billion into cash Isas in April, leading to the best start to an Isa season since the tax-friendly savings pots were launched in 1999.\n\nSavers have poured almost \u00a320billion into cash Isas in the first three months of this tax year.\n\nRachel Springall of Moneyfacts Compare said: 'The cash Isa market has seen a flurry of activity over the past six months, but variable rates are slightly down month-on-month.\n\n'However, this should not deter savers from reaping the benefits of investing cash in an Isa wrapper, to protect any interest earned from tax.'\n\n> Check the best savings rates using This is Money's independent best buy tables\n\nDoes YOUR savings account beat inflation? Keeping an eye on the CPI figure is key to knowing whether or not your savings are being eaten away by it\n\nIs it downhill from here for savings rates?\n\nThe short answer to this is yes, experts foresee savings rates falling now that the Bank of England has cut the base rate.\n\nOne savings expert expects easy-access rates to be the worst hit with rates potentially falling in the coming weeks.\n\nAndrew Hagger, founder of MoneyComms said: ''Easy-Access rates will take the biggest hit from a base rate cut and if a September cut starts to look nailed on then we'll probably see some fall off in rates in the next few weeks.'\n\nEasy-access rates have been slowly dipping over the last six months, and the top rate on offer has dropped from 5.2 to 5.04 per cent. Easy-access cash Isa rates have held up better.\n\nIn August 2023, the average easy-access account paid less than 3 per cent, at 2.81 per cent according to Moneyfacts Compare.\n\nSince the start of February 2024, the average easy-access rate has fallen from 3.17 per cent to 3.15 per cent.\n\nIn August 2023, the average easy-access cash Isa rate also stood at less than 3 per cent, paying 2.86 per cent\n\nSince the start of February 2024, the average easy-access cash Isa rate rose from 3.3 per cent to 3.36 per cent.\n\nJames Blower, founder of Savings Guru said: 'What we are likely to see, with the base rate cut to 5 per cent, is one-year best buy rates falling to around 5 per cent in August and below that in September/October.\n\nTwo year rates will drop below 5 per cent - likely to around 4.8 to 4.9 per cent in short order - and three year rates will ease back too.\n\n'Easy-access rates will pull back with best buys likely to be around 4.75 per cent to 4.9 per cent in August. Easy-access Isa rates will ease back too - there's unlikely to be any rates over 5 per cent - and fixed Isa rates will pull back too.\n\n'One year Isa rates have crept up with best buys around 4.95 per cent - but expect that to reverse with them coming down towards 4.75 per cent.'\n\nDon't bank on it: Some of the biggest banks on the high street pay less than 2% on savings held in easy-access accounts\n\nWhich banks offer the best savings rates?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing an account, it's always worth keeping some money in an easy-access account to fall back on if life throws you a curveball.\n\nMost personal finance experts believe that this should cover between three to six months' worth of basic living expenses.\n\nThe best easy-access deals, without any restrictions, pay just north of 5 per cent. If you're getting a lot less than this at the moment, you should seriously consider switching to a provider that pays more.\n\nBest accounts at a glance\n\nThere are 1,622 savings account that beat inflation this month, however, make sure you shop around for the best returns possible.\n\nEasy-access: Oxbury Bank - 5.04%\n\nBest notice account: Prosper* (365 day) - 5.78%\n\nOne-year fixed-rate: Union Bank of India - 5.4%\n\nTwo-year fixed-rate: Access Bank - 5.06%\n\nThree-year fixed rate: Access Bank - 4.8%\n\nFive-year fixed rate: Shawbrook Bank - 4.57%\n\nEasy-access cash Isa: Chip* - 5.1%\n\nOne-year cash Isa: Shawbrook Bank - 4.96%\n\nTwo-year cash Isa: Beehive Money - 4.7%\n\nProducts featured in this article are independently selected by This is Money's specialist journalists.

The Fed responded with a series of interest rate hikes that took its benchmark rate to the highest level in decades.\n\nThe spike in interest rates caused most consumer borrowing costs to skyrocket, putting many households under pressure.\n\nNow, as the central bank sets the stage to lower interest rates for the first time in years when it meets again in September, consumers may see their borrowing costs start come down as well -- and some already are.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which the U.S. central bank sets, is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the borrowing and savings rates they see every day.\n\n\"The first cut will not make a meaningful difference to people's pocketbooks, but it will be the beginning of a series of rate cuts at the end of this year and into next year that will,\" House said.\n\nThat could bring the the Fed's benchmark fed funds rate from the current range of 5.25% to 5.50% to below 4% by the end of next year, according to some experts.\n\nFrom credit cards and mortgage rates to auto loans and student debt, here's a look at where those monthly interest expenses stand as we move closer to that initial interest rate cut.\n\nSince most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. In the wake of the rate hike cycle, the average credit card rate rose from 16.34% in March 2022 to more than 20% today -- nearing an all-time high.\n\nAt the same time, with households struggling to keep up with the high cost of living, credit card balances are also higher and more cardholders are carrying debt from month to month or falling behind on payments.\n\nA recent report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a record in credit card delinquencies, according to data going back to 2012. Revolving debt balances also reached a new high even as banks reported tightening credit standards and declining new card originations.\n\nFor those paying 20% interest -- or more -- on a revolving balance, annual percentage rates will start to come down when the Fed cuts rates. But even then they will only ease off extremely high levels, offering little in the way of relief, according to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\n\"Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation,\" McBride said.\n\nThe best move for those with credit card debt is to take matters into their own hands, advised Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.\n\n\"They can do that by getting a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan or by calling their card issuer and requesting a lower interest rate on a card,\" he said. \"That works more often that you might think.\"\n\nWhile 15- and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and mostly tied to Treasury yields and the economy, they are partly influenced by the Fed's policy. Home loan rates have already started to fall, largely due to the prospect of a Fed-induced economic slowdown.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is now below 7%, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"If we continue to get good news on things like inflation, [mortgage rates] could continue trending downward,\" said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree. \"We shouldn't expect any gargantuan drops in the immediate future, but we might see rates trending back to their 2024 lows over the coming weeks and months,\" he said.\n\n\"If all goes really well, we could even end the year with the average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage closer to 6% than 6.5% or 7%.\"\n\nAt first glance, that might not seem significant, Channel added, but \"in mortgage land,\" a nearly 50 basis-point drop \"is nothing to scoff at.\" A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nAuto loans are fixed. However, payments have been getting bigger because the interest rates on new loans are higher, and along with rising car prices that has resulted in less affordable monthly payments.\n\nThe average rate on a five-year new car loan is now just shy of 8%, according to Bankrate.\n\nHowever, \"the financing is one variable, and it's frankly one of the smaller variables,\" McBride said. For example, a quarter percentage point reduction in rates on a $35,000, five-year loan calculates to $4 a month, he said.\n\nConsumers would benefit more from improving their credit scores, which could pave the way to even better loan terms, McBride said.\n\nFederal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers aren't immediately affected by the Fed's moves. But undergraduate students who took out direct federal student loans for the 2023-24 academic year are paying 5.50%, up from 4.99% in 2022-23 -- and the interest rate on federal direct undergraduate loans for the 2024-2025 academic year is 6.53%, the highest rate in at least a decade.\n\nPrivate student loans tend to have a variable rate tied to the prime rate, Treasury bill or another rate index, which means those borrowers are already paying more in interest. How much more, however, varies with the benchmark.\n\nFor those struggling with existing debt, there are ways federal borrowers can reduce their burden, including economic hardship and unemployment deferments, while the income-based student loan repayment plan, known as SAVE, is currently on hold amid legal challenges.\n\nPrivate loan borrowers have fewer options for relief -- although some could consider refinancing once rates drop, and those with better credit may already qualify for a lower rate.\n\nWhile the central bank has no direct influence on deposit rates, the yields tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate.\n\nAs a result, top-yielding online savings account rates have made significant moves and are now paying as much as 5.5% -- well above the rate of inflation, which is a rare win for anyone building up a cash cushion, according to Bankrate's McBride.\n\nBut those rates will fall once the central bank lowers its benchmark, he added. \"If you've been considering a certificate of deposit, now is the time to lock it in,\" McBride said. \"Those yields will not get better, so there is no advantage to waiting.\"\n\nCurrently, a top-yielding one-year CD pays more than 5.3%, as good as a high-yield savings account.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Traders had priced in around a 60% chance of the base rate being cut today. This will be welcome news for millions of mortgage holders who've been hammered with higher costs.\n\nThe Bank of England last cut interest rates in March 2020 - at the time the figure was lowered to an historic low of just 0.1%. It remained at this level until December 2021 when the Bank of England started putting up borrowing costs. The last increase was in August 2023 when the base rate hit 5.25% - it had been held at this level up until today.\n\nThe base rate is what the Bank of England charges other banks and lenders to borrow money - this then impacts how much you're charged as a customer when you take out credit. The Bank of England had been raising interest rates to bring down inflation, with the theory being that if people have less money to spend, this would bring demand for goods down and lower prices.\n\nInflation, which is a measure of how prices have changed over time, finally hit the Bank of England target of 2% in the 12 months to May and remained unchanged in June.\n\nHow much money will you save on your mortgage? Let us know by emailing: levi.winchester@reachplc.com\n\nFollow our Bank of England interest rates LIVE blog for the latest updates and analysis\n\nHow it impacts your mortgage\n\nIf you have a tracker mortgage, your monthly repayments will go down from today as these mortgages move in line with the base rate. For the average UK homeowner on one of these deals, the rate cut today will result in their monthly mortgage payment being reduced by \u00a332, according to TotallyMoney and Moneycomms.\n\nBut these homeowners have been hit hard by the previous Bank of England rate hikes, which means they're paying substantially more compared to before the first base rate increase in December 2021. For someone who took out a \u00a3250,000 mortgage over a 25-year term, on a rate of 1.58% in December 2021, their monthly repayment would have been \u00a31,009 - but now, Moneyfacts says the typical rate is 5.95% meaning they're paying \u00a31,603 a month.\n\nStandard variable rate (SVR) deals can be changed whenever your lender decides, though they do tend to move roughly in line with the base rate. You'll usually be moved to the SVR of your existing lender once your current mortgage deal ends. More than 1.2 million people are on a tracker or SVR mortgage.\n\nIf you have a fixed rate mortgage, your payments won't change today as you've already agreed to pay a fixed amount each month for a set period of time. However, when the time comes to remortgage, you may find the deals available today are more expensive compared to the deal you're on now. Around 700,000 fixed rate deals are due to end in the second half of this year, according to UK Finance.\n\nHow it impacts credit cards and loans\n\nIf your credit card is specifically linked to the base rate, then how much you pay back in interest can be affected when it rises or falls. You should check your terms and conditions to see if this applies to you. If your credit card rate is changing, you should get 30 days' notice.\n\nCredit card rates are normally variable, which means they can change over time anyway. You'll also find the rates available now if you're taking out a new card are more expensive compared to before the first rate hike. The average credit card purchase APR in July was 35.2%, according to Moneyfacts.\n\nInterest rates on personal loans and car financing are normally fixed, but do check with your lender to be sure. The rates on new loans are also higher now compared to last year. Moneyfacts says the average loan interest rate is 11.7% for someone borrowing \u00a35,000 over three years.\n\nHow it impacts your savings\n\nSavers should act fast to get the best rates, as you may find some saving account providers may start to lower their rates now. The good news is, there are still plenty of accounts that pay above the rate of inflation. The top-rate easy-access account today is Ulster Bank which pays 5.2%. OakNorth Bank pays slightly more at 5.37% but you have to give 95 days notice ahead of a withdrawal.\n\nFor those who can lock their cash away, the Union Bank of India (UK) Ltd offers a one-year bond that comes with a rate of 5.40%. If you're looking for an ISA, which protects your savings interest from tax but you can only put away \u00a320,000 each tax year, the best rate is 5.2% from Trading212.\n\nRegular savings accounts offer the best rates, but you're normally only allowed to make small deposits each month and some accounts restrict how many withdrawals you can make. Principality Building Society pays 8% fixed for six months but you can only deposit up to \u00a3200 each month.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "levi_winchester@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Levi Winchester", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjustable-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjustable-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individual savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OakNorth_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OakNorth Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_Building_Society", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Principality Building Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulster Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32104958.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Concerned-woman-holding-on-lap-computer-in-hand-credit-card.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 566, "textEnd": 576}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

will see the fall take effect depends on which type of home loan you have.\n\nThose on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages usually see an immediate change in payments.\n\nThere are 643,000 customers on tracker mortgages and 624,000 on SVRs.\n\nA 0.25 percentage point cut could cut bills for variable and tracker mortgages by \u00a3384 a year, according to Totally Money.\n\nUnfortunately, those on fixed-rate mortgages won't see anything change until their deals ends and they take out a new one.\n\nThe vast majority of mortgage holders are on fixed deals - almost 7million.\n\nAround 700,000 fixed rate mortgage deals are due to end in the second half of this year, according to UK Finance.\n\nWhen rates jumped up to 6%, borrowers on fixed-rate deals faced huge increases in mortgage bills and it made it harder for first-time buyers to get on the ladder.\n\nUnfortunately, brokers do not think rates will ever return to record lows of 1 or 2%.\n\nIf the base rate is lowered, the cost of borrowing through loans, credit cards and overdrafts can also fall.\n\nHowever, certain loans, such as personal loans or car financing, usually stay the same, as you have already agreed on a rate.\n\nBut you may be charged a lower rate on a future loan, and lenders may drop the rate on credit cards and overdrafts.\n\nYour lender will let you know before making any changes.\n\nSavers are the main group to have benefited from rising interest rates.\n\nThis is because banks tend to battle over offering market-leading rates, although they can be a lot slower to pass on customers.\n\nBut if interest rates fall, it can spell bad news for those with a nest egg.\n\nEither way, anyone currently getting a low rate on easy-access savings could find it's worth looking around for a better rate and moving their money.\n\nThe BoE's base rate also impacts pensioners looking to buy an annuity.\n\nA pension annuity converts your pension pot into a guaranteed regular income for the rest of your life.\n\nBut because annuity rates are linked to the cost of Government borrowing, any rise or fall in the BoE's base rate can have an impact on the rate you receive.\n\nThe income you receive can be locked in on the day you purchase your annuity, so current annuity rates can make a big difference to your long-term financial security.\n\nWith interest rates going down, pensioners may be able to secure less favourable rates.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Fed responded with a series of interest rate hikes that took its benchmark rate to the highest level in decades.\n\nThe spike in interest rates caused most consumer borrowing costs to skyrocket, putting many households under pressure.\n\nNow, as the central bank sets the stage to lower interest rates for the first time in years when it meets again in September, consumers may see their borrowing costs start come down as well -- some are already.\n\nThe federal funds rate, which the U.S. central bank sets, is the rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's moves still affect the borrowing and savings rates they see every day.\n\n\"The first cut will not make a meaningful difference to people's pocketbooks but it will be the beginning of a series of rate cuts at the end the of this year and into next year that will,\" House said.\n\nThat could bring the the Fed's benchmark fed funds rate from the current range of 5.25% to 5.50% to below 4% by the end of next year, according to some experts.\n\nFrom credit cards and mortgage rates to auto loans and student debt, here's a look at where those monthly interest expenses stand as we move closer to that initial interest rate cut.\n\nSince most credit cards have a variable rate, there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. In the wake of the rate hike cycle, the average credit card rate rose from 16.34% in March 2022 to more than 20% today -- nearing an all-time high.\n\nAt the same time, with households struggling to keep up with the high cost of living, credit card balances are also higher and more cardholders are carrying debt from month to month or falling behind on payments.\n\nA recent report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed credit card delinquencies at an all-time high, according to data going back to 2012. Revolving debt balances also reached a new high even as banks reported tightening credit standards and declining new card originations.\n\nFor those paying 20% interest -- or more -- on a revolving balance, annual percentage rates will start to come down when the Fed cuts rates. But even then they will only ease off extremely high levels, offering little in the way of relief, according to Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.\n\n\"Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation,\" McBride said.\n\nThe best move for those with credit card debt is to take matters into their own hands, advised Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.\n\n\"They can do that by getting a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan or by calling their card issuer and requesting a lower interest rate on a card,\" he said. \"That works more often that you might think.\"\n\nWhile 15- and 30-year mortgage rates are fixed and mostly tied to Treasury yields and the economy, they are partly influenced by the Fed's policy. Home loan rates have already started to fall, largely due to the prospect of a Fed-induced economic slowdown.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is now just below 7%, according to Bankrate.\n\n\"If we continue to get good news on things like inflation, [mortgage rates] could continue trending downward,\" said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree. \"We shouldn't expect any gargantuan drops in the immediate future, but we might see rates trending back to their 2024 lows over the coming weeks and months,\" he said.\n\n\"If all goes really well, we could even end the year with the average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage closer to 6% than 6.5% or 7%.\"\n\nAt first glance, that might not seem significant, Channel added, but \"in mortgage land,\" a nearly 50 basis-point drop \"is nothing to scoff at.\"\n\nAuto loans are fixed. However, payments have been getting bigger because the interest rates on new loans are higher, along with rising car prices, resulting in less affordable monthly payments.\n\nThe average rate on a five-year new car loan is now just shy of 8%, according to Bankrate.\n\nHowever, here, \"the financing is one variable, and it's frankly one of the smaller variables,\" McBride said. For example, a quarter percentage point reduction in rates on a $35,000, five-year loan is $4 a month, he calculated.\n\nConsumers would benefit more from improving their credit scores, which could pave the way to even better loan terms, McBride said.\n\nFederal student loan rates are also fixed, so most borrowers aren't immediately affected by the Fed's moves. But undergraduate students who took out direct federal student loans for the 2023-24 academic year are paying 5.50%, up from 4.99% in 2022-23 -- and the interest rate on federal direct undergraduate loans for the 2024-2025 academic year is 6.53%, the highest rate in at least a decade.\n\nPrivate student loans tend to have a variable rate tied to the prime, Treasury bill or another rate index, which means those borrowers are already paying more in interest. How much more, however, varies with the benchmark.\n\nFor those struggling with existing debt, there are ways federal borrowers can reduce their burden, including economic hardship and unemployment deferments, while the income-based student loan repayment plan, known as SAVE, is currently on hold amid legal challenges.\n\nPrivate loan borrowers have fewer options for relief -- although some could consider refinancing once rates drop, and those with better credit may already qualify for a lower rate.\n\nWhile the central bank has no direct influence on deposit rates, the yields tend to be correlated to changes in the target federal funds rate.\n\nAs a result, top-yielding online savings account rates have made significant moves and are now paying as much as 5.5% -- well above the rate of inflation, which is a rare win for anyone building up a cash cushion, according to Bankrate's McBride.\n\nBut those rates will fall once the Fed lowers its benchmark, he added. \"If you've been considering a certificate of deposit, now is the time to lock it in,\" McBride said. \"Those yields will not get better, so there is no advantage to waiting.\"\n\nCurrently, a top-yielding one-year CD pays more than 5.3%, as good as a high-yield savings account.", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The rate is currently at a 16-year high and has been at this level since August last year. If the committee decide to cut, it will be the first time since 2020 that the base rate has gone down.\n\nFinancial markets are sat at 64% on it being lashed by 0.25 percentage points to 5% today. However, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has previously warned that the committee will only cut interest rates once they're confident inflation will remain under control. James Smith, developed market economist for ING, said it will be a \"close call\" but he expects a majority of policymakers to vote in favour of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut.\n\nExpectations were first raised of an August rate cut after inflation finally hit its 2% target in the 12 months to May - but this then began to dampen after inflation remained at this level and didn't fall further in June. Alongside this, core inflation remains a concern for policymakers because it is higher than the headline rate, which includes more volatile energy and food prices. Core CPI was forecast to fall to 3.4% in June but remained at 3.5%, the same as in May.\n\nService inflation also rose by 5.7% in the 12 months to June, which is above the Bank of England 5.1% projection. The base rate dictates how much interest you pay when you borrow money, so mortgages and credit card rates usually get more expensive when it goes up. However, savers are considered the winners when the base rate rises as you are paid more money on your savings pots.\n\n07:34Ruby FlanaganWhat is the Bank of England base rate?\n\nThe Bank of England's base rate, sometimes known as the bank rate or base interest rate has a major impact on money and finances in the UK. This is because it influences what banks and lenders charge you to borrow money. The rate mainly affects mortgages, credit cards, and loans. When the base rate goes up it makes all of these more expensive.\n\nHowever, it also has an impact on savings, as the rate that is paid on your cash pots should also move in line with the rate. This means you should earn more money through interest on your savings when the base rate is higher.\n\n07:34Levi WinchesterBank of England announcement due at 12pm today\n\nWelcome to the The Mirror's Bank of England live blog. Here we will be giving you the latest updates and analysis ahead of the interest rates announcement at 12pm.

adding thousands of pounds to some bills.\n\nAround 700,000 fixed rate mortgage deals are due to end in the second half of this year, according to UK Finance.\n\nBut the upturn in the base rate has also seen rates on savings accounts pushed up.\n\nWith inflation slowing, some economists had been predicting the BoE would bring down interest rates and ease pain on mortgage holders.\n\nIf banks and building societies pass the changes onto consumers, it is good news for borrowers, such as homeowners, who may see mortgage rates drop.\n\nBut it means savers will also see the amount paid on their nest eggs weaken.\n\nHere we explain what the rate dropping means for your money.\n\nIf interest rates fall, it usually means mortgage rates will too.\n\nWhen you will see the fall take effect depends on which type of home loan you have.\n\nThose on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) mortgages usually see an immediate change in payments.\n\nThere are 643,000 customers on tracker mortgages and 624,000 on SVRs.\n\nA 0.25 percentage point cut could cut bills for variable and tracker mortgages by \u00a3384 a year, according to Totally Money.\n\nUnfortunately, those on fixed-rate mortgages won't see anything change until their deals ends and they take out a new one.\n\nThe vast majority of mortgage holders are on fixed deals - almost 7million.\n\nAround 700,000 fixed rate mortgage deals are due to end in the second half of this year, according to UK Finance.\n\nWhen rates jumped up to 6%, borrowers on fixed-rate deals faced huge increases in mortgage bills and it made it harder for first-time buyers to get on the ladder.\n\nUnfortunately, brokers do not think rates will ever return to record lows of 1 or 2%.\n\nHowever, certain loans, such as personal loans or car financing, usually stay the same, as you have already agreed on a rate.\n\nBut you may be charged a lower rate on a future loan, and lenders may drop the rate on credit cards and overdrafts.\n\nYour lender will let you know before making any changes.\n\nSavers are the main group to have benefited from rising interest rates.\n\nThis is because banks tend to battle over offering market-leading rates, although they can be a lot slower to pass on customers.\n\nBut if interest rates fall, it can spell bad news for those with a nest egg.\n\nEither way, anyone currently getting a low rate on easy-access savings could find it's worth looking around for a better rate and moving their money.\n\nThe BoE's base rate also impacts pensioners looking to buy an annuity.\n\nA pension annuity converts your pension pot into a guaranteed regular income for the rest of your life.\n\nBut because annuity rates are linked to the cost of Government borrowing, any rise or fall in the BoE's base rate can have an impact on the rate you receive.\n\nThe income you receive can be locked in on the day you purchase your annuity, so current annuity rates can make a big difference to your long-term financial security.\n\nWith interest rates going down, pensioners may be able to secure less favourable rates.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_walker@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Sam Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UK Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floating interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Building society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annuity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annuity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overdraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RW-OP-BANK-OF-ENGLAND_73c46c.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Many of them are cutting back spending on essential items and delaying major purchases like cars and homes as a result.\n\nHowever, the Fed is wary of cutting interest rates too soon, as it did the last time the U.S. economy dealt with soaring inflation. Back in the '70s and '80s, the Fed hiked and then cut rates quickly, and inflation came back with a vengeance, soaring as high as 13.5%.\n\nSome are beginning to worry the Fed may be over-correcting as a result.\n\n\"Continuing to keep rates elevated could be harmful for consumers and the economy as a whole, which is already showing signs of cooling,\" Sofia Baig, economist at Morning Consult, said in a statement shared with Money.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, Powell signaled that an interest rate cut is coming \"as soon as the next meeting\" if inflation continues cooling and the labor market remains stable.\n\nThe central bankers next gather for the FOMC in September. Analysts have been predicting that a rate cut at the September meeting is a given.\n\nAccording to CME FedWatch, markets are already pricing in a 100% probability of a September rate cut -- the main question is by how much. Investors are mostly expecting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, though about 10% of them are pricing in a 0.5 percentage point cut.\n\nThe Fed will be closely eyeing inflation and jobs data between now and September to determine whether to cut and by how much. If inflation continues to cool while the job market holds steady, the cut is more likely to be by a quarter percentage point; though if the job market falters in the meantime and unemployment rises, the cut could deepen to a half percentage point.\n\nThe Fed's decision to hold rates steady means consumers must weather high interest rates for at least a little longer.\n\nFor folks who are primarily building their nest egg, that could be a good thing. Interest rates remaining steady mean larger yields on certificates of deposit, high-yield savings accounts and other similar accounts. On the other hand, borrowers will continue to face record-high mortgage and credit card payments. Elevated interest rates -- which translate into mortgage rates near 7% -- have ground the housing market to a near halt. Homebuyers looking for some relief from steep mortgage rates likely won't find any until the fall.\n\nBenchmark interest rates affect all kinds of other areas of household finances, too, including the annual percentage rates (APRs) on home-equity loans, personal loans, student loans and more.\n\nWhen interest rates are reduced, consumers are likely to first see the effects on their savings accounts and variable-interest debt payments such as home-equity lines of credit (HELOC) or credit cards.\n\nLower interest rates also have implications for the stock market. According to the financial firm Morningstar, the two are closely related. Generally speaking, when interest rates are high, stocks are seen as riskier, and investors tend to allocate more of their portfolios into safer options such as bonds. The opposite also tends to be true: When interest rates fall -- or are expected to fall -- investors may move money back into stocks.\n\nFor what it's worth, the stock market has had a particularly strong performance on Wednesday, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq indexes up more than 1%, 2% and 3%, respectively.\n\nAs the stock market adjusts to potentially lower rates, analysts at U.S. Bank had this advice for investors: \"Be prepared for potential stock price fluctuations in the near term.\"\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Student Loan Interest Rates\n\nAmericans Think Inflation Will Get Worse After the Election.

so this decision is a big deal.\n\nThis is also the first time the Bank has lowered the interest rates since the start of the Covid pandemic.\n\nThere was no guarantee the rate was going to fall this month and many economists said it was \"too tough to call\" what the Bank would decide ahead of time.\n\nToday's announcement comes after inflation - the rate at which prices change over a 12-month period - stayed steady at its target rate of 2% for two consecutive months.\n\nIt is the Bank of England's responsibility to keep inflation at this target rate, set by the government, because it is seen as the ideal rate to make sure the economy grows but without pricing people out of the cost of living.\n\nThe interest rate is the main lever the Bank uses to control inflation.\n\nBut Threadneedle Street had previously indicated it was watching several other factors, too.\n\nIt wanted to see if price growth in the service sector of the economy is slowing down, and if the job market is cooling.\n\nWage growth slowed to the lowest level in two years in May, and unemployment rates remained unchanged although the number of job vacancies fell by 30,000.\n\nInflation soared to a 41-year high in October 2022, reaching a whopping 11.1%, which is why the Bank of England started to increase its interest rate.\n\nSince the 2008 financial crisis, the rate had been kept below 1% - in fact, in December 2021, it was at 0.1%, a record low.\n\nBut the cost of living crisis, triggered by soaring energy prices and the pandemic, meant inflation started to soar.\n\nThe Bank started to increase interest rates incrementally in an effort to keep inflation in check.\n\nBut inflation turned out to be exceptionally stubborn, so the Bank kept increasing interest rates until it reached 5.25% - a particularly high rate last used in April 2008 - which started to decrease economic activity.\n\nSpending declined so much that the UK even went into a brief and shallow recession at the end of last year, but it came out in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nLower rates increase the value of wealth, like pensions or housing.\n\nIf rates decline and you have a loan or mortgage, your interest payments may reduce -

This commission does not influence our editors' opinions or evaluations. Please view our full advertiser disclosure policy.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee has opted not to change its key interest rate again. The Federal Reserve will maintain its target fed funds interest rate range of 5.25% to 5.5%. The decision to keep interest rates at 23-year highs came as no surprise to economists.\n\nThe Fed has not adjusted interest rates since July 2023. But economists are hopeful the FOMC will finally pivot from rate hikes to rate cuts in the near future.\n\nLower interest rates could significantly impact Americans with savings, retirement investments and debt.\n\nFed interest rates\n\nThe federal funds rate is often considered the most important U.S. interest rate. It represents the interest rate commercial banks charge on overnight loans to other banks. Banks regularly lend money to one another to maintain the minimum amounts of capital required by law.\n\nThe Federal Reserve determines the federal funds rate. The FOMC is a committee of 12 Fed officials that meets regularly throughout the year to determine monetary policy.\n\nPart of the FOMC's task is to raise or lower the federal funds rate to promote a healthy U.S. economy. Higher rates are considered economically restrictive, while lower rates are considered stimulative.\n\nFed interest rate history: 2020 to 2024\n\nThe U.S. economy began recovering from the pandemic in May 2020. Historically low interest rates helped in that recovery. Unfortunately, within two years, the Fed would have another big problem: inflation. Supply chain disruptions and $5 trillion in government stimulus measures sent prices skyrocketing. The FOMC started raising interest rates again to slow the overheating economy. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed implemented 11 fed funds rate hikes. The target rate climbed to its current range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nProgress in bringing down inflation from 40-year highs has been slow and bumpy. But the FOMC has been comfortable maintaining its fed funds rate at 23-year highs for over a year.\n\nThe Fed's preferred inflation measure is the core personal consumption expenditures price index. In June 2024, core PCE was up 2.6% year over year. The 2.6% inflation reading is still above the Fed's 2% target. But it is down sharply from its peak of 5.6% in early 2022.\n\nThe Fed began tapering its monthly runoff of Treasurys and agency mortgage-backed securities in June 2024. It is now allowing a runoff of $25 billion in Treasurys and $35 billion in MBS per month. Economists see the runoff tapering as a precursor to interest rate cuts.\n\nGiven the progress the FOMC has made in bringing down inflation, economists anticipate at least one interest rate cut by the end of 2024.\n\nIn its most recent economic projections, the FOMC implies one or more interest rate cuts in 2024. The bond market is pricing in nearly an 88% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut at its September meeting. So the likelihood is the fed funds rate will drop to between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe timing and number of interest rate cuts in 2024 will depend largely on economic data. A rebound in inflation could delay interest rate cuts. Conversely, weakness in the U.S. labor market could lead to more aggressive cuts.\n\nHow does the Fed rate impact banking interest rates?\n\nThe federal funds rate does not directly impact consumers. But it does have a major indirect impact on the rates banks charge their customers. Banks typically respond to changes in the fed funds rate by moving their interest rates in the same direction.\n\nWhen the FOMC raises interest rates, for example, banks may raise rates on credit cards and auto loans. These changes negatively impact consumers.\n\nBut higher interest rates on savings accounts can also help consumers generate more interest income. FOMC interest rate cuts typically mean banks will lower the rates they charge on mortgages and other loans.\n\nThe current banking interest rates in the U.S.\n\nThe current fed funds target rate range of 5.25% to 5.5% is historically high.\n\nAmericans with debt are getting squeezed. Rates on credit cards, mortgages, student loans and other forms of debt are elevated. But 2024 has been very kind to savers. Interest rates paid on savings and different types of bank accounts are high.\n\nSavings accounts\n\nAs of July 2024, the national average interest rate paid on savings accounts is 0.45% annual percentage yield. But many high-yield savings accounts pay interest rates much higher than the national average. Some high-yield savings accounts pay an APY of more than 5%.\n\nInterest checking accounts\n\nInterest checking accounts have notoriously low interest rates. The national average APY for interest checking accounts is just 0.08%. But some of the best high-yield checking accounts pay APYs as high as 5.15%. High-yield checking accounts can be a great way to earn interest on money you use for daily financial transactions.\n\nMoney market accounts\n\nMoney market accounts provide many of the features of checking accounts but typically pay higher interest rates. The caveat is that they may restrict the user's number of monthly transactions. The national average money market account yield is 0.66% APY, and some accounts can pay more than 3%.\n\nCD rates\n\nCertificates of deposit are bank savings accounts that restrict your access for a set period. In return for forfeiting access, CDs typically pay much higher interest rates than savings accounts. The average APY on CDs with terms of three months to 12 months ranges from 1.53% to 1.85%. But high-yield CDs can have APYs over 5%.\n\nFed rate decision\n\nAt its July 31 meeting, the FOMC said it has made progress toward its 2% inflation goal. But committee members said they would need to see more evidence inflation is trending steadily downward before interest rate cuts are appropriate.\n\nThey underscored ongoing concerns about balancing inflation risks with the mandate of maximizing employment.\n\nIn June, the U.S. unemployment rate reached 4.1%, its highest level since October 2021. But the FOMC acknowledged in its statement that unemployment remains historically low.\n\nWhen can we expect the Fed to cut rates?\n\nAt his postmeeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted the first interest rate cut could come as soon as September.\n\n\"The question will be whether the totality of the data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks are consistent with rising confidence on inflation and maintaining a solid labor market,\" Powell said. \"If that test is met, a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table for as soon as the next meeting in September.\"\n\nPowell's comments initially triggered a big rally in the U.S. stock market.\n\nJeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, said the FOMC is subtly preparing markets for upcoming interest rate cuts. \"As inflation rates improve and unemployment increases, the Fed can cut rates yet keep the nominal funds rate above the inflation rate.

5% in first drop since 2020", "body": "UK interest rates have been cut for the first time in more than four years, releasing some pressure on borrowers as the Bank of England was encouraged by signs that inflation has slowed.\n\nThe Bank reduced rates from 5.25% to 5%, following a split vote which saw some members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) prefer to keep the level unchanged.\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey, who voted for a cut, said \"inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates today\".\n\nBorrowing costs had been held at 5.25% - the highest level in 16 years - since August last year.\n\nThursday's decision marks a turning point for the Bank, which has not implemented a rate cut since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nIt means that while rates remain elevated, mortgage costs could start to come down further while savings rates offered by banks could be reduced.\n\nFive of the MPC's nine members felt a 0.25 percentage point cut was appropriate after seeing evidence that factors putting pressure on overall inflation across the UK had eased.\n\nIt comes after official figures showed the rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation hit the Bank's 2% target level in May and June, indicating that overall price rises had been brought under control.\n\nHowever, four members of the committee, including the Bank's chief economist, Huw Pill, voted to keep interest rates at 5.25% for longer.\n\nThose policymakers felt they needed to wait for \"stronger evidence\" that the risks of underlying inflation pressures were not going to worsen.\n\nFurthermore, CPI inflation is predicted to increase to around 2.75% in the second half of the year, slightly higher than previous estimates, due to a smaller-than-expected drag from energy bills.\n\nMr Bailey signalled that rates would fall more gradually than they have risen over the past few years.\n\nHe said \"we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much\".\n\n\"Ensuring low and stable inflation is the best thing we can do to support economic growth and the prosperity of the country,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England expects the UK economy to grow by 1.25% this year, higher than its previous outlook of a 0.5% rise.\n\nIt kept its outlook the same for economic growth in 2025 which it expects to dip to 1%.\n\nBased on interest rate expectations among financial markets, the Bank predicted that CPI inflation could drop as low as 1.7% in the next three years.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Higher rates deter people from borrowing and encourage them to save - hence less money gets spent out there in the economy and retailers become less confident about setting high prices.\n\nHigh interest rates are, to put it more bluntly, a form of economic pain. And the Bank thinks that even at 5%, where they are now after today's cut, they are still at a painful level - or, as they would put it, \"in restrictive territory\".\n\nThis is a large part of the explanation for why unemployment is higher, house prices are lower and for why many households are still struggling - even though the annual rate of inflation is now back to the Bank's target rate of 2%.\n\nSo the decision to cut rates will start, gradually, to reduce that pressure - that pain. Indeed, in some senses the pain is already reducing somewhat: mortgage providers, anticipating lower Bank of England rates, have already begun to reduce fixed rate mortgage rates. Today, those with floating rate mortgages will see an instant reduction in their costs.\n\nThe big question now is: what next? First things first, don't expect those borrowing costs to come down as quickly as they went up. Markets think there might be one more cut this year, and that borrowing costs will come down quite gradually.\n\nSecond, few people inside the Bank expect borrowing costs to come down to the levels they were at back in 2021, when they were sitting at a historic low of 0.1%. Instead, they seem moderately happy with market expectations that rates will drop only to 3.5% over the next three years.\n\nAre interest rates still in \"restrictive territory\" then? That's a question no-one at the Bank wants to answer.\n\nThe Bank's decision today wasn't exactly a surprise: financial markets had put the probability of a rate cut today at over 60%. Even so, it was perhaps the most finely-balanced decision in a long time.\n\nFar from being a unanimous verdict, four of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee actually voted to leave interest rates at 5.25%. This wasn't, in other words, a slam dunk.\n\nAnd the documents released alongside the decision were chock full of provisos: rates would need to \"remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation retuning sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term had dissipated further.\"\n\nIn other words: we're not out of the woods yet.

But he signalled that the central bank was going to be careful not to cut rates too quickly going forward.\n\nMr Bailey said policymakers \"need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much\".

Have you held off on any major decisions? Comment below, and join in on the conversation.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee will decide whether to cut or hold the current rate of 5.25%, with an expected cut of 0.25% if it goes ahead. Economists and markets reckon there's a 60% chance that the cut goes ahead.\n\nThe Bank of England's base rate has an impact on every corner of the UK, as it helps to determine what banks and lenders charge to let you borrow money. The rate affects peoples' mortgages, credit cards and loans, so high rates mean that household costs go up.\n\nThis also affects savings returns, as people let the banks borrow their money instead. Those who can save have had a good period of high interest rates.\n\nThose on fixed rate mortgages will be unaffected by any drop unless their current deal is coming to an end. The cost of tracker mortgages will change, as will the most expensive Standard Variable Rate (SVR) mortgages that people will default to when their deals end without signing a new one.\n\nThose on tracker mortages could see their monthly repayments drop by \u00a328 if the cut goes ahead. The less favourable SVRs would drop by around \u00a315 per month.\n\nThe Bank changes the interest rate to respond to inflation in the UK. Inflation makes it more expensive to buy things, and it is typical to want to keep it low, predictable and steady. Inflation is around 2% currently, which is a comfortable target.\n\nA higher base rate means that you have less money to spend, which the Bank hopes will reduce inflation and make people hold on to their money for longer and decrease demand.\n\nHigh street banks like Natwest, Barclays, and HSBC have already lowered their mortgage rates in anticipation of today's announcement, which is a sign that they expect cuts soon, if not today.\n\nHave your say!

That means high car loan interest rates will likely linger, too. The Federal Open Market Committee is holding the federal funds rate at historic highs in hopes of addressing high inflation, which tends to drive higher rates on consumer loan products.\n\nSo, are car interest rates high right now? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. If you plan on buying a car soon, it's important to understand and prepare to face these factors.\n\nChoices by the Federal Reserve affect the benchmark rate, which has a domino effect on the cost of vehicle financing. Although a driver's rates depend on several factors -- including a borrower's credit history, term length, vehicle type and more -- increased inflation means higher interest rates for drivers even with perfect credit.\n\n\"One of the Fed's core duties is to keep purchasing power in check, and they do it by raising interest rates,\" explains Sarah Foster, senior U.S. economy reporter at Bankrate.\n\nTo achieve this goal, the Federal Open Market Committee increased rates 11 times since March 2022. As of July 2024, the FOMC has held the rate steady for its last eight meetings. The benchmark rate remains at 5.25-5.5 percent.\n\nBankrate experts believe the FOMC's next move will be to reduce the rate.\n\nAccording to Foster, rising interest rates make it more expensive to borrow money. And that, combined with high costs, has been like a one-two punch to Americans' finances.\n\nShe explains that this has left many drivers \"resigned to finance an exceptionally expensive big-ticket purchase at an uncomfortably high rate.\"\n\nHigher interest rates are just one result of the Feds' goal to quell inflation. \"Higher borrowing costs don't just disincentivize spending but squeeze people out of being able to afford big-ticket items, causing the economy to slow,\" Foster says.\n\nEven if the Fed decides against raising interest rates, says Foster, Fed Chair Jerome Powell warns that high interest rates will not disappear anytime soon.\n\nWith this in mind, drivers should prepare for higher rates as the Fed continues to control high inflation.\n\nThe above increases can be attributed to the higher benchmark rate and more expensive vehicles. Stay up to date with changing news and how it affects your finances on Bankrate's Federal reserve hub.\n\nWhile the interest rate you receive depends on many factors, including uncontrollable ones like inflation, you can still make moves to save money regardless of rate hikes made by the Fed.\n\nMost lenders will have higher rates right now, but that doesn't negate the benefit of shopping around. Compare rates and terms from at least three lenders to decide which quote is best for your needs. Pay close attention to the available APR along with the repayment term.\n\nAs vehicle prices hit record highs, focusing on your budget when shopping is vital. With little wiggle room, it is best to calculate how much you can truly afford before heading to the dealership. This way, you will understand how much you need to borrow to drive your new car.\n\nThe upfront cost of an EV tends to be higher, but they do carry added benefits outside of the gas pump. By applying for a green auto loan and receiving EV tax credits, you can make back any money lost due to higher interest rates.\n\nOne of the most sure-fire ways to get a good deal is to apply for loan preapproval, which will give you a firm idea of what your expected rates will be. Not all lenders offer this step, so look for it when shopping around.\n\nUnfortunately, new and used vehicles carry higher rates than usual, but used prices are slightly lower. If you have any flexibility in the type of vehicle you want, buying a used car can save you money on your monthly cost.\n\nOne of the most effective times to consider refinancing your auto loan is when rates have lowered and your credit score has improved. The process is similar to applying for your initial loan.\n\nAlthough many do not have the luxury of waiting to buy a car, patience may be on your side when it comes to saving money. Interest rates will continue to make borrowing money for your vehicle more expensive. So whether you plan to wait out the high rates or head to a dealership, prepare for higher prices to finance your vehicle.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_betterton@bankrate.com", "name": "Rebecca Betterton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrate", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domino effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2022/11/04150412/GettyImages-651424277.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday, while signaling that a cut is possible when policy-setting officials meet again in September.\n\nThe Fed has raised its key rate to 5.33 percent from near zero in a series of increases starting March 2022. The goal was to rein in inflation, which has since cooled considerably. Now, Fed officials want to be sure prices remain under control while considering its second objective, which is to keep a strong job market. If interest rates are elevated for too long, they risk weakening the employment picture.\n\nThe central bank uses interest rates to influence the broader economy. When policymakers raise rates, money becomes more expensive to borrow, which slows consumer demand. Conversely, lower rates may spur more spending, igniting economic growth.\n\nBut the direction of rates also has implications on consumers' wallets. Here's how different rates are affected by the Fed's decisions -- and where they stand.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nCredit card rates are closely linked to the central bank's actions, which means that consumers with revolving debt have seen those rates rise quickly over the past couple of years. Increases usually occur within one or two billing cycles, but don't expect them to fall quite as rapidly even when rates eventually decline.\n\nThat means that consumers should prioritize repayment of higher-cost debt and take advantage of zero-percent and low-rate balance transfer offers when they can.\n\nThe average rate on credit cards with assessed interest was 22.76 percent at the end of June, according to the Fed, up slightly from 22.16 percent a year earlier and 16.17 percent at the end of March 2022, when the central bank began its series of rate increases.\n\nCar Loans\n\nAuto loan rates remain elevated, which has squeezed affordability and dampened demand among would-be car buyers. But automakers and dealerships have begun offering more discounts and other incentives, which has lured some buyers back to the market.\n\n\"Manufacturers are not offering many low-rate loans, but lucky consumers can find some financing deals ahead of expected market-rate declines later this year,\" Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at the market research firm Cox Automotive, said in a recent report.\n\nThe average rate on new-car loans was 7.3 percent in June, according to Edmunds, a car shopping website, up from 7.2 percent in the same month in 2023 and 5.2 percent in 2022. Used-car rates were even higher: The average loan carried an 11.5 percent rate in June, up from 11 percent in June 2023 and 8.3 percent in 2022.\n\nCar loans tend to track with the yield on the five-year Treasury note, which is influenced by the Fed's key rate -- but that's not the only factor that determines how much consumers will pay. A borrower's credit history, the type of vehicle, the loan term and the down payment are all baked into that rate calculation.\n\nMortgages\n\nMortgage rates have retreated a bit from their most recent peak. After reaching as high as 7.22 percent in early May, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.78 percent as of July 25, according to the mortgage-financing giant Freddie Mac. That's up from 6.81 percent in the same week last year.\n\n\"Despite these lower rates, buyers continue to pause, as reflected in tumbling new and existing home sales data,\" said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.\n\nIt's been a volatile ride. Rates climbed as high as 7.79 percent in late October before dropping about a point lower and stabilizing, at least temporarily.\n\nRates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages don't move in tandem with the Fed's benchmark, but instead generally track with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations about inflation, the Fed's actions and how investors react.\n\nOther home loans are more closely tethered to the central bank's decisions. Home-equity lines of credit and adjustable-rate mortgages -- which each carry variable interest rates -- generally rise within two billing cycles after a change in the Fed's rates. The average rate on a home-equity loan was 8.59 percent as of July 24, according to Bankrate, a consumer financial website, while the average home-equity line of credit was 9.17 percent.\n\nStudent Loans\n\nBorrowers who already hold federal student loans are not affected by the Fed's actions because such debt carries a fixed rate set by the government. But rates on new federal student loans recently rose to their highest level in a decade: Borrowers with federal undergraduate loans disbursed after July 1 (but before July 1, 2025) will pay 6.53 percent, up from 5.5 percent for loans disbursed in the same period a year before.\n\nRates on loans for graduate and professional students increased to 8.08 percent. And rates on PLUS loans -- financing available to graduate students and parents of undergraduate students -- rose to 9.08 percent.\n\nThe rates are priced each July using a formula that is based on the 10-year Treasury bond auction in May.\n\nBorrowers of private student loans have already seen rates climb because of previous rate increases: Both fixed- and variable-rate loans are linked to benchmarks that track the federal funds rate, the Fed's benchmark rate.\n\nSavings Vehicles\n\nIndividuals have been earning more on their savings, but if the Fed suggests that rate cuts are on the way, that could all begin to change. \"Banks have a history of being proactive in cutting deposit rates when the Fed signals a forthcoming rate cut,\" said Ken Tumin, founder of financial site DepositAccounts.com, part of the online loan marketplace LendingTree.\n\nSavers usually benefit when the federal funds rate is higher because many banks pay more on their savings accounts, particularly if they want to attract more deposits.\n\nOnline institutions tend to price their savings accounts much more competitively than their brick-and-mortar counterparts, though some have already begun to dial down their rates.\n\nThe rates on certificates of deposit, which track similarly dated Treasury securities, have already dropped multiple times this year. Now may be the time to lock in the most attractive yields before they fall further.\n\nThe average one-year C.D. at online banks was 4.99 percent as of July 8, down from its peak yield of 5.35 percent in January, but up from 4.88 percent a year earlier, according to DepositAccounts.com. But you can still find one-year C.D.s with yields of more than 5.25 percent.\n\nMost online banks have held their savings account rates relatively steady: The average yield on an online savings account was 4.40 percent as of July 8, down only slightly from a peak of 4.49 percent in January, according to DepositAccounts.com, and up from 4.08 percent a year ago.\n\nYields on money-market funds offered by brokerage firms are even higher. The yield on the Crane 100 Money Fund Index, which tracks the largest money-market funds, was 5.13 percent on July 29.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tara_siegel_bernard@nytimes.com", "name": "Tara Siegel Bernard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jeanna_smialek@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeanna Smialek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loans_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student loans in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrate", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Certificate of deposit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/31/multimedia/31fed-blog-zhlj/31fed-blog-zhlj-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 3242, "textEnd": 3249}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 4288, "textEnd": 4295}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 4726, "textEnd": 4732}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 6418, "textEnd": 6424, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 7099, "textEnd": 7106}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Moneyfactscompare.co.uk has analysed the average rates offered across savings and mortgages and how the markets have changed over time.\n\n\"A year has now gone by since the Bank of England last increased the base rate, but other influences have been at play to impact the mortgage market. Fixed mortgage rates have been falling at a steady pace, with lenders feeling more encouraged to re-price their deals due to lower swap rates. Consequently, the average rates on a two- and five-year fixed rate mortgage have both decreased month-on month for the first time in six months. Waiting six months for rates to fall will no doubt require a lot of patience from borrowers who are counting down the days towards the end of their low-rate fixed deal. However, despite the latest falls, borrowers may want to see a bigger injection of rate competition, particularly as rates are higher than they were six months ago. Those desperate to secure a new deal for peace of mind could do so a few months before they come off their existing deal, as some lenders will let borrowers do this from three to six months in advance.\n\n\"Borrowers coming off a deal this year must acknowledge that they will need to set aside more of their income to cover higher repayments. On average, a two-year fixed deal was priced in at 3.95% in August 2022, and back in August 2019 a five-year fixed was 2.84%. However, it is still cheaper to lock into a fixed mortgage than sit on a revert rate. The Standard Variable Rate (SVR) has sat above 8% for almost an entire year and has almost doubled since the Bank of England started increasing base rate back in December 2021. A typical mortgage being charged the current average SVR of 8.16% would be paying \u00a3380 more per month, compared to a typical two-year fixed rate*. First-time buyers trying to get their foot onto the property ladder will find some competitive deals out there, but their home-ownership dreams weigh on whether they can find an affordable property, particularly if they don't have the Bank of Mum and Dad to make their dream a reality.\"\n\n*Average standard variable rate (SVR) is currently 8.16%. Calculations based on a \u00a3250,000 mortgage over a 25-year term on a repayment basis. SVR repayment \u00a31,956 per month, versus \u00a31,576 per month on 5.77% two-year fixed rate.\n\n\"Savers need to make sure they proactively check and switch their flexible pots if they haven't done so for the past few months. Just because the Bank of England base rate has remained at 5.25% over the past year does not mean saving rates have stagnated. In fact, challenger banks and mutuals offer some attractive rates, so it's wise to look beyond the more familiar big banks. Indeed, the convenience of saving cash in an easy access account with the biggest high street banks comes at a cost. The average rate paid across the biggest high street banks** is 2.01%, which is less than the current market average easy access rate across all savings providers. The last time base rate rose was in August 2023, by 0.25%; six months later the average easy access rate rose to 3.17%, but again, average rate paid across the biggest high street banks was less, at 2.04%**.\n\n\"There are expectations for base rate to fall before the year is over, so those savers who want a guaranteed return would be wise to consider either a fixed rate bond or ISA for a guaranteed return. It is also imperative that savers with bigger pots keep an eye on whether they are due to breach their Personal Savings Allowance (PSA), and if they haven't already, consider utilising their ISA allowance to protect their money from tax. Once a base rate cut happens, it can have a big impact on the variable rate market in a short time frame but can also trigger providers to adjust fixed rates as a consequence. In March 2020, the base rate was cut twice, down from 0.75% to 0.25% and then again to 0.10%. In six months thereafter, the average easy access rate fell from 0.56% at the start of March 2020 to 0.22% in September 2020. This was an unprecedented period due to the pandemic, but it is important for savers to prepare themselves for rate cuts should the Bank of England base rate fall.\"\n\n**High street banks include Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander.

Karin Caifa reports.\n\nNew York (CNN) -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday did not lower its key interest rate, which has been sitting at a 23-year high for the last 12 months. But officials continue to signal that the central bank may do so soon -- most likely in September.\n\nAnd the market expects that the central bank could continue cutting rates over the next two years. That means interest rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts, certificates of deposit and bonds, among others.\n\nGiven the many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response.\n\nTiming and magnitude matter\n\nThe prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcomed by those seeking loans or trying to reduce debt. But, realistically, how much you'll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely \"not that much.\"\n\n\"Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\nBy that he means: \"Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],\" McBride said. \"And for savers, [the initial declines] won't wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.\"\n\nThat's because one or two quarter-point rate cuts this year won't meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.\n\n\"Don't jump the gun too early on this stuff,\" said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.\n\nHere's how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips on what to do about it.\n\nYour home\n\nGetting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people make. Mortgage rates are influenced directly and indirectly by several economic factors, and the Fed's moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small rate cuts could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.\n\nFor those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you'll also be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That's because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.\n\nTo buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher -- they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.\n\nGiven that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25 percentage points in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over two or three points, Diodato sees it this way: \"Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn't stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.\"\n\nHELOCs: If you're taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it's no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won't make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. \"Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn't make it free money.\"\n\nOf course, if you want a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.\n\nAnd if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, \"aggressively pay it down. It's high-cost debt that won't get cheaper soon.\"\n\nYour credit cards\n\nAnother perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance. A few rate cuts won't make much of a dent in today's record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if they ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 -- 16.3% -- it will still be a pricey loan.\n\nThat's why, if you're carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.\n\nIf that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. \"They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,\" Dodiato said.\n\nYour car\n\nIf you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.\n\n\"Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you're financing and your credit rating,\" he said.\n\nAs for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called \"money factor\" you will pay to lease. And because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.\n\nYour savings\n\nThe past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts or various fixed-income vehicles, all of which were yielding 5% or more.\n\nWhile those rates will come down -- and some have already begun doing so -- the initial drops aren't likely to be huge. That means you'll still be able to earn inflation-beating returns for a while.\n\nFor example, plenty of online high yield savings accounts are still offering between 4.5% to 5.2% yields, according to Bankrate. The same is true of certificates of deposit.\n\nAmong Treasury notes with maturities of between two- and 10 years, yields are north of 4%, according to Schwab.com.\n\nLock in high rates now: If you're within five years of retirement, McBride suggests locking in some of these still-high rates to grow cash you'll need to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won't be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement.\n\nFor instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for one of those maturities, try to find one that is not \"callable.\" A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.\n\nIf you live in a high-tax area, Treasuries might be a better bet since they're exempt from state and local taxes.\n\n\"Even though many bond yields are off their recent highs, investors should still consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years,\" said Collin Martin, a fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nAnd AAA-rated municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, and in some cases, state and local taxes too. Yields on AAA munis with maturities between one and five years are ranging between 3.2% and 4.19%.\n\nBut don't keep too much in cash: For people not near retirement, it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward.\n\n\"I caution people against the cash trap.

In response to rising prices, the Fed embarked on a series of rate hikes, bringing its benchmark rate from near zero to more than 5%. While inflation has slowed a bit since 2023, currently, interest rates remain at a 21-year high, and the Fed forecasts keeping rates steady for the foreseeable future.\n\nDue to the Fed's rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, it's become more expensive to borrow and more lucrative to save. When the Fed changes the federal funds rate, it impacts everything from credit card APRs to mortgage rates to high-yield savings account annual percentage yields (APYs).\n\nWe'll dive into how the Fed's rate changes affect how much you earn on your savings. But before that, here are a few key terms you should know:\n\nWhen the Fed hikes rates, it costs more to borrow money, so it's more expensive to take out a loan or carry any type of debt. Rate hikes can also lead to layoffs -- some companies may cut expenses in response to higher borrowing costs.\n\n\"Higher interest rates slow spending and encourage savings among households and businesses,\" says Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. \"This reduction in spending and investment will slow economic growth and inflationary pressures.\"\n\nHowever, higher rates have some benefits: the APY on your deposit account (like your high-yield savings account or CD) increases when the federal funds rate rises, making saving more attractive than spending.\n\nThe opposite is true when the Fed decreases the federal funds rate: APYs decline. According to the FDIC, the national deposit rate on savings is only 0.45%.\n\nSince rates remain high, now is a good time to put some money into savings -- especially since we're not sure when the Fed may decide to make a rate cut.\n\nIf you're unsure of how to take advantage of the current high interest rates, here are a few ideas:\n\nWhen the Fed changes interest rates, it affects rates on a range of consumer banking and financial products. While the Fed may still reduce rates later in 2024, consumers can continue to take advantage of high-interest rates by putting their money in a high-yield savings or money market account.\n\nHowever, since these accounts are variable-rate accounts, the APY fluctuates with changes in the federal funds rate. If you want a lock in rates, consider investing in a longer-term account or asset like a 5-year CD or a Treasury security.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutual organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deposit account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money market account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Recommends_1270998711_Fed_rate_savings_account.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

But, realistically, how much you'll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely \"not that much.\"\n\n\"Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\nBy that he means: \"Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],\" McBride said. \"And for savers, [the initial declines] won't wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.\"\n\nThat's because one or two quarter-point rate cuts this year won't meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then.\n\n\"Don't jump the gun too early on this stuff,\" said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning.\n\nHere's how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips on what to do about it.\n\nYour home\n\nGetting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people make. Mortgage rates are influenced directly and indirectly by several economic factors, and the Fed's moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small rate cuts could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay.\n\nFor those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you'll also be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That's because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.\n\nTo buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher -- they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.\n\nGiven that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25 percentage points in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over two or three points, Diodato sees it this way: \"Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn't stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.\"\n\nHELOCs: If you're taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it's no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won't make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. \"Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn't make it free money.\"\n\nOf course, if you want a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.\n\nAnd if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, \"aggressively pay it down. It's high-cost debt that won't get cheaper soon.\"\n\nYour credit cards\n\nAnother perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance. A few rate cuts won't make much of a dent in today's record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if they ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 -- 16.3% -- it will still be a pricey loan.\n\nThat's why, if you're carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.\n\nIf that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. \"They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,\" Dodiato said.\n\nYour car\n\nIf you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.\n\n\"Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you're financing and your credit rating,\" he said.\n\nAs for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called \"money factor\" you will pay to lease. And because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.\n\nYour savings\n\nThe past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts or various fixed-income vehicles, all of which were yielding 5% or more.\n\nWhile those rates will come down -- and some have already begun doing so -- the initial drops aren't likely to be huge. That means you'll still be able to earn inflation-beating returns for a while.\n\nFor example, plenty of online high yield savings accounts are still offering between 4.5% to 5.2% yields, according to Bankrate. The same is true of certificates of deposit.\n\nAmong Treasury notes with maturities of between two- and 10 years, yields are north of 4%, according to Schwab.com.\n\nLock in high rates now: If you're within five years of retirement, McBride suggests locking in some of these still-high rates to grow cash you'll need to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won't be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement.\n\nFor instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for one of those maturities, try to find one that is not \"callable.\" A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.\n\nIf you live in a high-tax area, Treasuries might be a better bet since they're exempt from state and local taxes.\n\n\"Even though many bond yields are off their recent highs, investors should still consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years,\" said Collin Martin, a fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nAnd AAA-rated municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, and in some cases, state and local taxes too. Yields on AAA munis with maturities between one and five years are ranging between 3.2% and 4.19%.\n\nBut don't keep too much in cash: For people not near retirement, it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward.\n\n\"I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,\" said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.\n\nHis advice: Don't keep more than six months' to a year's worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents.\n\n\"Anything more than that and you're putting a drag on your future net worth,\" he said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you'll also be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That's because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance.\n\nTo buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher -- they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree.\n\nGiven that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25 percentage points in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over two or three points, Diodato sees it this way: \"Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn't stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.\"\n\nHELOCs: If you're taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it's no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won't make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. \"Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn't make it free money.\"\n\nOf course, if you want a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted.\n\nAnd if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, \"aggressively pay it down. It's high-cost debt that won't get cheaper soon.\"\n\nYour credit cards\n\nAnother perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance. A few rate cuts won't make much of a dent in today's record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if they ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 -- 16.3% -- it will still be a pricey loan.\n\nThat's why, if you're carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe.\n\nIf that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. \"They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,\" Dodiato said.\n\nYour car\n\nIf you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year.\n\n\"Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you're financing and your credit rating,\" he said.\n\nAs for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called \"money factor\" you will pay to lease. And because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates.\n\nYour savings\n\nThe past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts or various fixed-income vehicles, all of which were yielding 5% or more.\n\nWhile those rates will come down -- and some have already begun doing so -- the initial drops aren't likely to be huge. That means you'll still be able to earn inflation-beating returns for a while.\n\nFor example, plenty of online high yield savings accounts are still offering between 4.5% to 5.2% yields, according to Bankrate. The same is true of certificates of deposit.\n\nAmong Treasury notes with maturities of between two- and 10 years, yields are north of 4%, according to Schwab.com.\n\nLock in high rates now: If you're within five years of retirement, McBride suggests locking in some of these still-high rates to grow cash you'll need to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won't be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big market downturn at the start of your retirement.\n\nFor instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for one of those maturities, try to find one that is not \"callable.\" A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years.\n\nIf you live in a high-tax area, Treasuries might be a better bet since they're exempt from state and local taxes.\n\n\"Even though many bond yields are off their recent highs, investors should still consider buying some intermediate-term investments now before rates are cut if they want to lock in a higher yield for some of their money, such as Treasury notes maturing in the next four to 10 years,\" said Collin Martin, a fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\nAnd AAA-rated municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes, and in some cases, state and local taxes too. Yields on AAA munis with maturities between one and five years are ranging between 3.2% and 4.19%.\n\nBut don't keep too much in cash: For people not near retirement, it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward.\n\n\"I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,\" said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years.\n\nHis advice: Don't keep more than six months' to a year's worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents.\n\n\"Anything more than that and you're putting a drag on your future net worth,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanne_sahadi@cnn.com", "name": "Jeanne Sahadi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home equity line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Financial_Planner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Certified Financial Planner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Certificate of deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Municipal bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalents", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cash and cash equivalents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maturity (finance)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1335043843-20240730203539776.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 217, "textEnd": 224}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The Federal Reserve is expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday, while signaling that a cut is possible when policy-setting officials meet again in September.\n\nThe Fed has raised its key rate to 5.33 percent from near zero in a series of increases starting March 2022.

Now, Fed officials want to be sure prices remain under control while considering its second objective, which is to keep a strong job market. If interest rates are elevated for too long, they risk weakening the employment picture.\n\nThe central bank uses interest rates to influence the broader economy. When policymakers raise rates, money becomes more expensive to borrow, which slows consumer demand. Conversely, lower rates may spur more spending, igniting economic growth.\n\nBut the direction of rates also has implications on consumers' wallets. Here's how different rates are affected by the Fed's decisions -- and where they stand.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nCredit card rates are closely linked to the central bank's actions, which means that consumers with revolving debt have seen those rates rise quickly over the past couple of years.

signs that inflation has slowed.\n\nThe Bank reduced rates from 5.25% to 5%, following a split vote which saw some members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) prefer to keep the level unchanged.\n\nGovernor Andrew Bailey, who voted for a cut, said \"inflationary pressures have eased enough that we've been able to cut interest rates today\".\n\nBut he signalled that the central bank was going to be careful not to cut rates too quickly going forward.\n\nBorrowing costs had been held at 5.25% - the highest level in 16 years - since August last year.\n\nThursday's decision marks a turning point for the Bank, which has not implemented a rate cut since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nIt means that while rates remain elevated, mortgage costs could start to come down further while savings rates offered by banks could be reduced.\n\nFive of the MPC's nine members felt a 0.25 percentage point cut was appropriate after seeing evidence that factors putting pressure on overall inflation across the UK had eased.\n\nIt comes after official figures showed the rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation hit the Bank's 2% target level in May and June, indicating that overall price rises had been brought under control.\n\nHowever, four members of the committee, including the Bank's chief economist, Huw Pill, voted to keep interest rates at 5.25% for longer.\n\nThose policymakers felt they needed to wait for \"stronger evidence\" that the risks of underlying inflation pressures were not going to worsen.\n\nThese pressures include services inflation, stronger-than-expected economic growth and elevated wage rises, which have remained a concern for the Bank.\n\nFurthermore, CPI inflation is predicted to increase to around 2.75% in the second half of the year, slightly higher than previous estimates, due to a smaller-than-expected drag from energy bills.\n\nMr Bailey signalled that rates would fall more gradually than they have risen over the past few years.\n\nHe said \"we need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much\".\n\n\"Ensuring low and stable inflation is the best thing we can do to support economic growth and the prosperity of the country,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England expects the UK economy to grow by 1.25% this year, higher than its previous outlook of a 0.5% rise.\n\nIt kept its outlook the same for economic growth in 2025 which it expects to dip to 1%.\n\nBased on interest rate expectations among financial markets, the Bank

Interest rates are going to stay in the spotlight, and that will impact on how we all plan our investments moving forward.\n\nCurrent expectations suggest a fall in interest rates towards the end of the year. But even if rates come down, they are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAs we chart a course through this 'higher-for-longer' era, our priority remains clear: to manage the impacts thoughtfully and strategically, ensuring that your investments are well-positioned for both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nOur three messages for this quarter are:\n\nUnderstanding the transition from low to high interest rates.\n\nFive years ago, it was easy to assume rock-bottom interest rates would stick around forever. Low mortgage payments were almost taken for granted.\n\nMoney HQ | What's the investment impact of Labour's win?\n\nThat all changed in 2021. Supply shortages due to the Covid-19 pandemic combined with Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered inflationary pressures that had been dormant for years.\n\nCentral banks, including the Bank of England, responded by raising interest rates. The goal was to cool the economy by making borrowing more expensive, reducing consumer and business spending to help rein in inflation.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2023, the Bank of England increased interest rates 14 times, eventually holding them at 5.25%.\n\nNow, after years of hiking interest rates, attention is turning to how quickly and easily central banks can reverse course.\n\nIn June, Canada became the first country in the G7 to cut rates, suggesting it believes inflationary pressures are subsiding. The European Central Bank opted to lower rates soon after, indicating a similar sentiment.\n\nIn the UK, consumer price inflation has fallen back to the Bank of England's 2% target, but service sector inflation remains over 5%. Before the Bank decides to relax its monetary policy, it will want to ensure inflation is fully under control, so the first cut could be delayed until the Autumn.\n\nInflation has proved even stickier in the US, hovering around 3% compared with the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This could mean we see an even more cautious approach to cuts from the Fed.\n\nCentral banks globally are navigating a precarious balancing act: promote economic growth by cutting the cost of borrowing, but risk igniting further inflation.\n\nThe most widely held view is that interest rates, both in the UK and elsewhere, will decline from their current levels, but settle at a level higher than before the pandemic. In other words, a return to near-zero interest rates is extremely unlikely.\n\nUK interest rates around 5% may feel unusually high after years below 1%, but this reflects a move back to more typical rates.\n\nAdapting to this 'new normal' of higher rates will present challenges and opportunities. Our investment team is focused on understanding the full effects to ensure we make the best decisions for your investments.\n\nInterest rates are a key factor influencing the performance of various asset classes, such as equities and bonds. It is therefore essential to understand these dynamics so that we can make informed decisions on where to allocate capital in our portfolios.\n\nHistorically, elevated rates have been associated with higher, not lower equity prices. This is because higher rates often come at a time of higher levels of economic growth, which can be beneficial for company profits.\n\nHowever, businesses that are heavily indebted are likely to face increased financial pressure under these conditions. Focusing on companies that are less sensitive to higher interest rates, especially those with strong balance sheets, low debt levels, and solid cash flows, can be prudent.\n\nNevertheless, diversification across various sectors and regions remains our key focus. Leveraging the expertise of our externally appointed equity managers along with in-house specialists helps us to identify a wide range of potential investment opportunities.\n\nBonds are loans given to governments or companies, which they promise to pay back after an agreed term. The bond issuer also pays interest at a set rate, which determines the bond's yield.\n\nInterest rates have a big impact on bond yields. When interest rates are high, bonds come with higher yields because they need to be attractive enough for investors to buy them. If interest rates are expected to stay higher for longer, then the yields on existing bonds are likely to remain relatively attractive for a while. This marks a departure from recent years when low interest rates made bonds less appealing.\n\nWe believe that bonds can once again provide effective diversification, offering predictable returns and less volatility compared to other investment types. This improved outlook for bonds is reflected in our latest portfolio allocations.\n\nAlternative investments, which can include assets such as commodities, private equity, and hedge funds, offer several key advantages. Some have a lower correlation with standard asset classes, while certain types, particularly commodities, can be effective hedges against inflation.\n\nHowever, with bond yields becoming more attractive, the bar for incorporating alternatives into our portfolios has been raised. This is because the risk versus return on alternatives is not as favourable as what bonds are now offering.\n\nGiven the possibility of one or two rate cuts this year, amidst a broader higher-for-longer outlook, sticking to our core investment principles remains crucial.

Although gross domestic product has been stronger than expected, the restrictive stance of monetary policy continues to weigh on activity in the real economy, leading to a looser labour market and bearing down on inflationary pressures.\"\n\nThough financial markets had forecast a rate cut to 5%, the decision was viewed as knife-edge in nature amid sticky UK core inflation and price rises in services sectors enjoying summer consumer demand.\n\nThe uncertainty was compounded by the Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates yesterday, although economists now expect the first rate cut from the Fed in September.\n\nAndrew Summers, chief investment officer at Omnis Investments, says housing will have played a key part in the decision to cut rates. He now expects a second cut in September.\n\n\"While there had been a strong services inflation print recently, forward-looking indicators suggest there is downside risk to services inflation in the coming months.\n\n\"For example, Homelet and RICs surveys suggest there is downward pressure on the Rents for Housing component of CPI. In addition, unemployment is rising and job vacancies are slowing, which should drive wages lower from here.\n\n\"Our expectation is that the Bank will lower rates further at the September meeting and ultimately more cuts will be delivered than what is currently discounted by markets.\"\n\nDavid Katimbo-Mugwanya, head of fixed income at EdenTree Investment Management, says markets are not surprised by the move.\n\n\"Shorter-dated bond yields, deemed as more sensitive to benchmark interest rates, have recently declined faster than those on longer-duration counterparts further out on the curve, indicating that the long-awaited shift came as no surprise to market participants,\" he says.\n\n\"Despite having witnessed further falls on goods price inflation over the last year, policymakers remain particularly alert to the trajectory of service price changes and wage pressures.\n\n\"BoE policymakers are therefore more likely to err on the side of caution vis-\u00e0-vis guidance rather than risk de-anchoring consumer prices expectations by cutting hastily, ultimately keeping rates higher for longer.\"\n\nAs interest rates decrease, cash savings rates on bank accounts and ISAs will likely decrease, meaning savers may start getting less bang for their buck at the bank.\n\nHowever, lower rates will also make consumer debt cheaper, which could bring some relief to people with substantial credit card debt - and mortgage holders with variable-rate products. Those who have remortgaged into fixed-rate products in the last two years may not feel this until they remortgage once more.\n\nMarkets tend to \"price in\" any changes very quickly, so the reaction to this kind of news will be swift. Conventional wisdom suggests rate cuts are better for equities than bonds. But while bonds have returned to favour in the higher interest rate era because of their tempting yields, rate cuts may not be bad for them either.\n\nFalling interest rates mean lower yields, which push bond prices ever higher - a key factor in total returns. And lower rates make existing bonds, and particularly those already issued during a period of rate hikes, more attractive for yield.\n\nIn addition, many pension funds, for whom rising bond yields have caused havoc, could also stand to benefit from a looser monetary approach. This may well benefit the government's attempts to reignite the UK's stagnant economy as (in theory) it encourages institutional investors to plough money into promising growth businesses.\n\nOver in the \"real economy\", the unwinding of monetary policy will likely also benefit shops and online businesses who have been squeezed by the twin spectres of supply chain inflation and lower consumer confidence. If higher interest rates have the power to curb spending in the UK economy and cool gross domestic product growth, lower rates will in theory create the opposite effect.\n\nIn practice, however, there is a lot of uncertainty. While lower interest rates tend to stimulate the economy, the UK is still expected to suffer from low growth in the coming years wherever rates end up. Either way, it will take time for the precise effects to be visible, let alone quantifiable.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ollie_smith@morningstar.co.uk", "name": "Ollie Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individual savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4eb669caa7dc65b2/bltdbf335189ae432a3/6499ec0029ad98260b825944/Andrew_Bailey_(1).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

With interest rates at a more than 21-year high, the cost of holding credit card debt has become increasingly expensive. In February, the average APR was 22.63% for all credit card accounts with assessed interest.\n\nMake a plan to reduce or eliminate your debt. With the avalanche method, borrowers attack high-interest debt first to save money on interest. If, however, you prefer small wins to keep the momentum going until you've paid off all your debt, try the snowball method. The best strategy for you will depend on what you can stick to long term.\n\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) utilize fixed APYs, meaning your rates won't change once you get them set up. Some 5-year CDs have annual percentage yields (APYs) over 4%, and several 1-year CDs currently have APYs well above 5%.\n\nIt's worth shopping around for a CD rate that takes advantage of the current high interest rates and potentially even setting up a CD ladder to make the best of the rates at hand.\n\nHigher interest rates aren't always bad news, especially for savers. The APY on your savings account will likely increase alongside the federal funds rate. If you're shopping for a new account to park your savings in, a higher APY can help your balance grow even faster.\n\nThe most recent rates from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) put the national savings APY average at 0.46%, although banks set their own rates, and you can likely secure a much higher APY by shopping around and utilizing a high yield savings account.\n\nAny time rates change or the market anticipates these changes, you could see positive and negative stock market swings. Higher interest rates tend to negatively affect earnings and stock prices, and investors might be tempted to panic-sell as a result. Higher rates can cause higher borrowing costs for companies, which can impact company earnings and make investors less optimistic about a company's profits.\n\nIf you're investing for a goal that is still years down the line, you may want to ride out any short-term market bumpiness. Timing the market is a risky move, and panic-selling could work against you by incurring even greater losses once the stock market bounces back.\n\nLenders rely heavily on your credit score and the information in your credit report to determine whether or not to give you financing for big purchases like a home or car. It's important to scope out different rates and improve your credit score, as doing so could mean more favorable terms.\n\n\"If consumers are waiting for lower interest rates to refinance, when interest rates finally do start to come down the best way that they're going to be able to take advantage of those is if they have good credit and good credit scores,\" says Michele Raneri, vice president and head of U.S. research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\nSome of the key ways to improve your score include:\n\nIf the federal funds rate declines later this year, rates on everything from credit card APRs to mortgages will follow. While this is good news for those carrying credit card debt or planning to buy a home, it could mean bad news for savers stashing cash in bank accounts.\n\nRegardless of what the Fed does, focus on what you can control when it comes to your finances -- shop around for the best rates on savings accounts, improve your credit score, and stick with a long-term investment plan.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Certificate of deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Recommends_money_moves_after_fed_rate_hike.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The Bank will be closely monitoring inflation risks - like wage growth - and with it already expecting inflation to start to accelerate again before the end of the year, it won't want to risk premature action stoking this any further.\n\n\"Advisers will play a pivotal role in helping clients understand what will influence future rate decisions and re-assuring them that their strategies are poised to succeed in a lower rate environment.\"\n\nKaren Barrett, CEO and Founder of Unbiased, said:\n\n\"After months of waiting, the Bank of England (BoE) has finally cut the base rate, offering much needed relief to millions of households that have been struggling.\n\n\"This decision symbolises a significant turning point for our country - economically and psychologically - and raises hopes that this could be the start of our journey out of the woods.\n\n\"Meanwhile, existing and potential homeowners may continue to benefit from the mortgage price war, with a recent highlight including Nationwide becoming the first lender to reintroduce sub-4% rates since February.\n\n\"For those on a variable-rate mortgage,monthly payments will likely fall immediately following the base rate cut. Savers should also prepare for the eventuality that rates will now start falling.\n\n\"It's also worth considering an annuity, as rates have risen to over 7%, according to Standard Life's annuity rate tracker, but these are also linked to the base rate, so make sure to lock one in before they fall.\"\n\nJames Burgess, head of commercial and insolvency expert at Atradius UK, says: \"Having held interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% for an entire year, businesses and consumers across the UK will be relieved at the outcome of today's announcement with rates falling to a welcomed 5%.\n\n\"This positive outlook for the economy is also reflected in our own claims data with an overall decline of 17% in late and failed payments in Q2 2024 compared to Q1 2024. This trend has continued into the construction sector, following a 28% decline in late and failed payments in the sector in Q2 2024 compared to Q1, showing a step in the right direction for the sector following today's rates cuts. This will also be welcome news to homeowners as the cut in rates alleviates their financial burdens around mortgage payments, putting the construction and housing sectors in an improved position as we progress through the second half of the year.\n\n\"For businesses, this news will mean that they can navigate the summer season with more confidence. Consumers may feel less restricted in terms of spending as this cut in rates could start to loosen purse strings. As well as a boost to consumer spending, business confidence and investments may improve over the coming months.\n\n\"Whilst we are not out of the woods yet, the outcome of today's announcement is certainly a step in the right direction for the UK economy, offering hope as we move through the remainder of the year. With inflation rates remaining at their target of 2% and interest rates sitting at 5%, it's safe to say that the economic position of the UK is improving. However, despite falling rates, the unpredictability of major world events, not least geopolitics and fears of war between Iran and Israel, mean it's essential that businesses remain vigilant and protect themselves against the domino effect of insolvency with proactive financial planning. This includes increasing liquidity, diversifying supply chains, and protecting vulnerable credit agreements with trade credit insurance.\"\n\nRob Morgan, Chief Investment Analyst at Charles Stanley said: \"Today's BoE interest rate decision was always going to be a close call and so it proved. Ultimately the balance of the rate setting committee at the BoE opted to make a cut for the first time in over four years.\n\n\"Looking at the inflation data there is perfect logic to this. Following almost three years of above-target rises, inflation has fallen to 2% in the past two months, and this more subdued picture overall was enough to convince the balance of voting members of the MPC the coast is clear to start the rate cut journey.\n\n\"However, the benign fa\u00e7ade of headline inflation masks more complex and concerning trends. Almost all the heavy lifting has been done by falling goods prices, while in services the inflationary embers continue to burn and this could mean further cuts are limited.\n\n\"Services inflation has remained stubborn thanks to sensitivity to robust wage increases, and both are rising at an annual 5.7% according to the latest readings. Until these embers show signs of dying out more concertedly the BoE is going to have a problem justifying more significant rate cuts.\n\n\"While wage pressure could ease, there are also risks they could re-accelerate. Public sector workers have recently been granted pay rises, while the 9.8% increase to the living wage in April continues to inflate the year-on-year numbers. Meanwhile, although wage pressures could ease further, there are also risks they could re-accelerate as public sector workers are granted pay rises and increases to minimum wages in the spring inflate the year-on-year numbers.\n\n\"Economic growth has also been a little stronger than anticipated, adding to the inflationary brew and the likely reticence of MPC members to make more significant cuts. GDP grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of this year, or 2.8% annualised, as the economy rebounded from a mild recession in the second half of 2023. Consumer confidence has so far held up despite the rapid increase in interest rates, and policymakers will not wish to risk a fresh resurgence in household spending rekindling price rises.\n\n\"Many households and businesses will be hoping for further interest rate cuts, which would more significantly relieve pressure on those with variable rate mortgages in particular. However, cuts will only be fine tuning rather than deep, owing to the stickiness of inflation and wage growth. It will therefore be a case of continuing to battle against high borrowing costs relative to recent history.\n\n\"Overall, following today's more we will likely see a shallow trajectory of cuts, perhaps at a roughly quarterly pace, towards the 4% level next year. There could be a faster cutting cycle only if growth disappoints or inflation becomes more firmly subdued, which looks unlikely.\"\n\nLily Megson, Policy Director at My Pension Expert said, \"In a broader sense, today's decision to cut interest rates after a year of holding them steady is a clear recognition of the improvements in our economy. Inflation has wreaked havoc on people's finances and curbing it has been the top priority.\n\n\"However, while a welcome relief for borrowers, the road ahead remains tough for savers and those preparing for retirement. Crucially, prices are still high; the cost-of-living crisis isn't over yet.\n\n\"As conditions start to stabilise, many will be eager to get their savings goals back on track. But it's key not to make any hasty decisions. For instance, some might be tempted to quickly buy an annuity, as annuity rates may fall in response to the lower interest rates. However, such decisions should always be made with careful consideration.\n\n\"Creating economic stability is vital, but equally important is supporting individuals in their financial planning. Savers need to be informed and cautious - providing access to financial education and advice to respond to these changes effectively and secure their financial futures should be the top priority for the government.\"\n\nHelen Vieira, Head of Banks at Flagstone International comments: \"For many this cut has been a long time coming. We are one year on from when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased base rate to 5.25% to combat rampant inflation in the UK. Speculation was reaching fever pitch as to when they would start to loosen that fiscal grip. Clearly that time is now.\n\n\"Despite the Government commitment this week to public sector pay increases and the ongoing volatility of food and energy prices the Bank of England has shown it feels reassured enough that the fires of inflation have been extinguished sufficiently as the last inflation data showed it had hit it's 2% target.\n\n\"Whilst central banks across the world will move with caution, the direction of travel now is set toward rates coming down further in the short to mid-term. Therefore, for those managing cash deposits internationally rates offered on cash vehicles will also start to tick down across many jurisdictions. It's important to stay informed and ready to take advantage of the best returns as we reset toward a new normal.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_annuity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Life annuity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa\u00e7ade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fa\u00e7ade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Morgan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Morgan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atradius", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atradius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_credit_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade credit insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domino effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Life_Aberdeen", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standard Life Aberdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ifamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bank-of-england.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

An elevated fed funds rate pushes up all types of borrowing costs, including those on credit cards, mortgages and auto loans.\n\nThe Fed has kept rates at record highs in order to slow the economy and, in turn, tame inflation.

As of July, these efforts appear to be paying off: The inflation rate is 2.5 percent, just half a percentage point above the Fed's goal.\n\nHowever, the Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate at a historic high for its last eight meetings. While auto loan rates may decline over time, that relief may be slow in arriving.\n\nThe key to saving money is preparedness. So, while the cost to borrow money increases, there are still ways to find your lowest possible rate.\n\nBy applying for auto loan preapproval, you can lock down your expected monthly cost before signing off on your vehicle. It gives you a firm grasp on the true cost of your new car and gives you a leg up during negotiation. You can also use the preapproved rate when comparing other loan options.\n\nTrading in your current vehicle is a great way to drive off with a new car while spending less cash on a down payment. It will also save you the headaches of selling your car privately.\n\nExperts recommend that you compare at least three different loan offers when looking for vehicle financing. Do not sign off on the first deal you come across, and understand that dealer financing often costs more than financing offered by outside lenders.\n\nAs with all large purchases, it's essential to do the math ahead of time to ensure that you only sign off on a vehicle that you can afford. This way, you can ensure you can keep up with your monthly payments and be prepared for even the worst-case scenario.\n\nWhile buying EVs tends to carry a higher purchase price tag, they can be much less expensive over the lifetime of ownership. Check out special tax credits offered in your state as well as green auto loans to save money on an eco-friendly vehicle.\n\nAt the June 31, 2024 meeting, the Fed announced it's holding rates steady for the eighth meeting in a row. This means the federal funds target rate is still 5.25-5.5 percent -- a 22-year high.\n\n\"Throughout history, when inflation rises or even looks like it's about to take off, the Federal Reserve has been called to action,\" explains Sarah Foster, senior U.S. economy reporter at Bankrate.\n\nThey do this by \"raising interest rates to cool demand and bring prices back into better balance,\" she concludes. And this is what the FOMC has been up to -- raising rates to try and address high inflation. But most Americans, she explains, see the pain before they see the gain.\n\nBorrowers feel that pain when financing big-ticket items such as new vehicles. Lenders have raised rates in response to a higher benchmark rate. And these higher rates have, combined with already higher prices, made a challenging environment for many.\n\nBut buyers should take heart. Experts say that falling inflation points to a rate cut in the near future.\n\n\"The long-awaited start to interest rate cuts is right around the corner,\" says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate chief financial analyst. \"Inflation is trending down and the economy is cooling, both of which align with the Federal Reserve beginning to cut interest rates in the coming months.\"\n\nAfter nearly two years of rate-raising by the Fed -- and a return to normal for the supply chain -- vehicle prices are finally leveling. Average transaction prices in September were down 3.4 percent compared to January, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\nIn early 2023, new vehicle prices peaked close to $50,000, which, combined with higher rates, made for a steep monthly cost. Higher levels of inventory and growing vehicle incentives pushed previously high prices down. Unless the United Auto Workers strike extends into the fourth quarter, hurting inventory levels, prices are likely to continue shrinking.\n\n\"We're seeing average transaction prices dip below $48,000 for the first time in more than a year,\" said Rebecca Rydzewski, research manager at Cox Automotive, regarding September prices.\n\nThese price dips are good news for buyers, but higher interest rates will likely remain -- at least until the end of the year.\n\nWhile it's true that a steep benchmark rate will impact your available rates, it is not all bad news. As the FOMC controls inflation, vehicle prices have declined, and there are still ways to save money when financing your vehicle.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_betterton@bankrate.com", "name": "Rebecca Betterton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrate", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Enterprises", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cox Enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelley_Blue_Book", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelley Blue Book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2022/06/14200429/How-to-save-money-on-auto-loans-following-Fed-rate-hike.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

It was last raised from this level in August 2023, and has remained the same until now.\n\nIt is the first time UK rates have been reduced since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nThe decision will come as welcome news to homeowners who have been struggling with rising mortgage payments over the past year.

Some were disappointed that the group decided not to lower the base rate last June, with inflation having already reached 2 percent at that point.\n\nHowever, speaking in May, Mr Bailey said he was \"optimistic\" a cut would come soon, saying that \"we need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates\".\n\nIt would appear the governor's threshold has been met as the lowered rate comes into practice from today. The announcement may open the way to further cuts this year, provided inflation continues to remain steady or in decline.\n\nWhile the drop is good sign for many, it is still a long way from the levels between 2008 and 2021. During this time, it was never increased above 0.75 percent, and even sat at 0.1 for several months until late 2021.\n\nMortgage rates have sky-rocketed alongside the rise in interest, leaving many homeowners facing much higher bills.

But what can investors expect from here and how long will the rate environment impact markets?\n\nFor more than two years the prospect of higher interest rates has been affecting markets, but the direction of rates hit a turning point in mid-2023. In nine of its last 10 meetings, including the one ending July 31, the Federal Reserve has opted to hold rates steady, after raising rates 11 times in this economic cycle. Now, few analysts doubt that rates are poised to move lower soon, as inflation - which hit 3 percent in June - comes increasingly under control.\n\nHigher rates and recession fears losing effect on the market\n\nWhile the Fed has raised rates 11 times during this tightening cycle, it's easy to spot when markets really sat up and took notice that the central bank wasn't kidding that it was about to recalibrate monetary policy. It was November 2021 when cryptocurrency and many of the riskiest stocks peaked.\n\n\"When the Fed introduced restrictive monetary policies by increasing rates in 2022, this caused equity markets and cryptocurrencies to appropriately decline in valuation,\" says Octavio Sandoval, director of investments at Illumen Capital.\n\n\"The stock market will never not worry about future interest rates,\" says Steve Azoury, head of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan. \"The cost of borrowing impacts all areas of investing, purchasing and savings. Just the anticipation of what may happen is enough to cause a stock market reaction.\"\n\nAnd the direction of rates seems to be frightening investors less these days, as they see the future path of interest rates likely heading lower.\n\nWhile major stock indexes such as the Standard & Poor's 500 spent most of 2022 in a funk due to rising rates, they fared well in 2023. The S&P 500 rose about 24 percent last year, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed around 43 percent. They followed that up with a strong first half this year, though they've retreated a bit from their recent all-time highs.\n\nBut what about the highly expected recession? The market's recent relative strength suggests that investors may be more optimistic - or at least, less pessimistic - than they were before. Many analysts forecast a so-called \"soft landing\" for the economy, a scenario where inflation declines and unemployment rises some but the economy does not go into a full recession.\n\nBut after a strong run-up in 2023 and 2024, there may yet be plenty of room for markets to fall further if the economy worsens significantly.\n\nMany unprofitable high-growth stocks had a rough 2022, and while prices firmed up in 2023, that doesn't mean these stocks are still anywhere close to their prior highs. For example, software stocks such as Cloudflare, Zoom Video Communications and Confluent are worth less than half their all-time highs. Nonetheless, profitable big-name stocks such as Microsoft, Apple and others in the Magnificent 7 fared well despite the moves in rates.\n\nCryptocurrency prices struggled as interest rates looked to move higher, but now that rates look poised for a fall in the near term, crypto prices have risen substantially. And the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs has helped boost the price of Bitcoin, which hit an all-time high in March. The prospect of lower rates and inflows to ETFs have pushed Ethereum higher, too.\n\nWill lower interest rates derail stocks?\n\nStocks and cryptocurrency endured notable volatility as investors factored in rising rates. But what's in store for the next six months, with the Fed expected to lower rates as soon as September?\n\nThe expectation of lower interest rates has helped buoy rate-sensitive sectors such as banks and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Small-cap indexes such as the Russell 2000 have also fared well in recent weeks, as the market began to price in the possibility of rate cuts happening soon. At the same time, the imminent arrival of lower rates hasn't seemed to boost big tech names such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, which fell well off their 52-week highs.\n\nMarket watchers are still divided as to whether the Fed will keep rates too high for too long and whether that's already reflected in current stock prices. This uncertainty itself drives volatility in the markets.\n\n\"I fear that this approach of not cutting rates, or fear of cutting interest rates too early, may push the economy into a short-term recession,\" says Dan Raju, CEO of Tradier, a brokerage platform.\n\n\"The soft landing narrative seems to have taken hold, but there continues to be plenty of market participants skeptical that this is actually going to happen,\" says Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at wealth advisor Halbert Hargrove in Long Beach, California.\n\nIn the meantime, markets continue to re-adjust to the economic environment with the expectation that rates are poised to move lower.\n\nThe bellwether 10-year Treasury, now offering a 4.12 percent yield, is well below its 52-week high of 4.99 percent set in October, after a surge to start the year, and it's been falling in recent weeks.\n\nNow, with short-term rates well above longer-term rates - a so-called yield-curve inversion - many market watchers are still expecting a recession to occur in 2024. A recession would likely push the stock market even lower until investors can begin to gauge the length and depth of any upcoming downturn. But that may not stop stocks from rallying intermittently.\n\nHow interest rates have affected crypto and commodities markets\n\nTwo other major asset classes have had varied responses in the face of higher rates. While cryptocurrency prices plummeted along with other risky assets, many commodities spiked higher in early 2022, including oil, but many of those moves proved short-lived. With the rising Fed funds rate slowing and then pausing in 2023, both oil and crypto seem to have found some support. And now with lower rates in the offing, both have found an extra tailwind.\n\nCryptocurrency has often been touted as a cure-all for what ails you, whether that's inflation, low interest rates, lack of purchasing power, devaluation of the dollar and so on. Those positives were easy to believe in as long as crypto was rising, seemingly regardless of other assets.\n\n\"The truth is that crypto prices have proven to be impacted by the same directional sentiment that impacts retail stock investors,\" says Raju. \"In general, high interest rates scare investors away from riskier investments like crypto, and the lowering of rates will be seen as a positive by the crypto investor community.\"\n\nIndeed, cryptocurrencies responded to reduced liquidity as did other risky assets, by falling when the Fed announced in November 2021 its intention to raise rates and then throughout 2022 as the Fed aggressively followed through. On top of that, the blow-ups of cryptocurrencies and exchanges such as FTX hammered traders' confidence in these virtual assets.\n\nBut instability in the banking sector led many traders to bid up cryptocurrency, in the belief that the future path of rate increases would be less severe. And as 10-year Treasury rates peaked in October 2023 and then fell, riskier assets have risen, as the path to lower interest rates appeared clear.\n\nHowever, other factors are also at play in the rise of cryptocurrency over the past year.\n\nSpinelli points to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs as a notable driver of crypto prices.\n\nIn early January, the SEC approved 11 asset managers to offer Bitcoin ETFs. The expectation of the approval helped the cryptocurrency finish 2023 strong, and then the inflows to the new ETFs powered the cryptocurrency to a new all-time high in March.\n\nAs for commodities, many have been well off their recent highs, as fewer supply constraints and higher interest rates work to take them down a few notches. But the expectation of lower rates has helped keep oil from falling substantially below $70 a barrel in 2023 and 2024. Pricing has also been supported by petroleum-producing countries that have announced supply cuts and some overall tightness in the market.\n\nFor example, the price of oil had been in a steady downtrend to around $70 per barrel after peaking at around $123 in June 2022. And in 2023, oil bottomed around $70 and floated between there and $80, despite a mid-year rise to $90. After hitting about $70 per barrel in early December 2023, oil trended higher to start the year but retreated to below $80 again by early June and has fallen in recent weeks.\n\nHow should interest rates impact your investing strategy?\n\nInterest rates, inflation and uncertainty - all create a stew of volatility for investors. With so much volatility, investors may want to tread cautiously.\n\nHowever, the best way for most investors to approach this type of market is to stick to the long-term game plan. For many, the long-term plan means continuing to invest regularly in a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds and mostly disregarding the noise around the world. For others, the game plan may involve buying and holding well-diversified index funds. Either way, don't let emotions get in the way of an effective long-term investing plan.\n\nWhile short-term traders may be sweating rates and trying to time a recession, it's vital to keep things in perspective. Instead of trying to find the right time to sell, buy-and-hold investors can use the market's volatility to their advantage and then try to find the right time to add more.\n\n\"For long-term investors, the pullbacks represent attractive buying opportunities,\" says Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate chief financial analyst.\n\nDownturns can be an attractive time to add to your portfolio at discounted prices. As investing legend Warren Buffett once said, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" That is, stocks are cheaper when few agree that they're an attractive investment.\n\nBottom line\n\nInterest rates rose fast in 2022 and 2023, and investors now expect the Fed to lower rates soon. Those investors with a long-term investing horizon may view a downturn as an ideal time to pick up some quality investments at bargain prices.\n\nAnd if stock valuations plummet? Buffett has some wisdom for that situation, too: \"Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_royal@kentucky.com", "name": "James Royal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate investment trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troy, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom Video Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Beach, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/5xdh1e/picture290621004/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/309be954-e26d-45e5-9628-46848aad2bd3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 418, "textEnd": 425}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Lucinda O'Brien, the site's savings accounts specialist, has shared her insights ahead of Thursday's base rate announcement.\n\nLucina explained: \"Interest rates on savings accounts have been consistently high this year, as the base rate remained at 5.25%. The base rate has been stuck at this point since August 2023, after we saw consecutive rises from December 2021. Staggeringly, the last cut in the base rate was in March 2020.\n\n\"These increases and subsequent stability indicated good news for savers, as providers have offered rates above 5% - which is significantly higher than the current inflation rate of 2%. On the other hand, the base rate has pushed up mortgage rates and caused anguish for homeowners. Therefore, a base rate reduction will be more than welcome from this perspective.\n\n\"But for savers, it's now an anxious wait ahead of the next Bank of England meeting on Thursday. Predictions are 50/50 that the monetary policy committee will vote in favour of dropping the base rate from 5.25% to 5%. Previously, it was expected the base rate would be unchanged in August, and instead things would shift at the next meeting in September.\"\n\nShe added: \"But the tide appears to be turning, as forecasters are now saying there could be a case for a base rate drop as soon as Thursday. Recent figures show inflation held steady at 2% in June, which was the Bank of England's target. If inflation stays low then this is a good case to start cutting the base rate, but there are other elements to consider. For example, services inflation (education, hospitality and culture) continues to be high at 5.7% and this could be the sticking point that sways the committee to hold off reducing the base rate.\n\n\"So as the decision could go either way on Thursday, it's best for savers to act now.\" She said: Currently, Union Bank of India is offering a one-year fixed-rate account at 5.40% and this can be opened with \u00a31,000. Raisin UK also has a range of competitive interest rates from providers, including GB Bank's one-year fixed-rate account at 5.26% and Ziraat Bank's one-year fixed-rate at 5.25%. Both these accounts can be opened online and with a minimum deposit of \u00a31,000.\n\n\"Oxbury has an easy access account at 5.04%, but you'll need to deposit at least \u00a325,000 and keep the balance above this to get the interest paid on a monthly basis. Alternatively, Principality has an easy access account at 5.0% and this can be opened with as little as \u00a31, but bear in mind you can only make three withdrawals every calendar year.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@ok.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/article33369428.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_savings.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 40, "textEnd": 48}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 551, "textEnd": 561}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Indeed, the average five-year fix has fallen below 4% for the first time since April.\n\nOn the other hand, savers have reaped the rewards from the increase in interest rates, but how long will that continue?\n\nWe take a look at the current rates and how the 12 months of 5.25% rates have impacted the mortgage and savings rates on offer, with data and commentary from finance expert Rachel Springall from Moneyfacts.\n\nLast August, the average two-year fixed rate stood at 6.85%, while the five-year equivalent was 6.37%.\n\nNow, those rates are 5.77% and 5.38% respectively, which have both dipped since July, when they were 5.53% for a two-year deal and 6.01% for a five-year deal.\n\nFor a longer-term deal, a 10-year deal is 5.93% on average, not far from the 5.89% rate in August 2023.\n\nHowever, when you look at the deals in December 2021, the contrast is stark, as the average 10-year rate stood at 2.97% and two- and five-year rates were 2.34% and 2.64% respectively.\n\nElsewhere, standard variable rates (SVRs) have followed the opposite direction of traffic since the base rate was held at 5.25%.\n\nSince August 2023, the rates have crawled up to 8.16% from a 7.85% rate, but this is small in comparison to the leap in August 2022, when they were 5.17% on average.\n\nRachel Springall believes mortgage holders will require a \"lot of patience\" as they wait for their fixed deal to expire before they can grab a more attractive rate.\n\nSpringall said: \"However, despite the latest falls, borrowers may want to see a bigger injection of rate competition, particularly as rates are higher than they were six months ago.\n\n\"Those desperate to secure a new deal for peace of mind could do so a few months before they come off their existing deal, as some lenders will let borrowers do this from three to six months in advance.\n\n\"Borrowers coming off a deal this year must acknowledge that they will need to set aside more of their income to cover higher repayments.\"\n\nSpringall also recommended sticking with a fixed rate deal due to the SVR holding little value since the base rate began to rise in December 2021.\n\nPaying the average 8.16% SVR could cost borrowers an extra \u00a3380 per month on a \u00a3250,000 home compared to a typical two-year fix on the market.\n\nShe added: \"First-time buyers trying to get their foot onto the property ladder will find some competitive deals out there, but their homeownership dreams weigh on whether they can find an affordable property, particularly if they don't have the Bank of Mum and Dad to make their dream a reality.\"\n\nIn the savings market, the average easy-access account was 2.81% in August 2023, while the easy-access cash ISA was 2.86% on average.\n\nThe savings market has not fluctuated as much as the mortgage market in the year since the base rate has been held at 5.25%.\n\nIn the last month particularly, there has been little change across the board.\n\nFor August 2024, the average easy-access and easy-access cash ISA accounts come to 3.15% and 3.36% respectively.\n\nA notice ISA is now 4.22%, up by 0.57% on last August's rate, whereas its non-ISA equivalent has gone up from 3.9% to 4.29%.\n\nLooking back to before the base rate hikes, the average savings rate for easy-access and easy-access ISAs were much lower and both below 0.3%. Now, there are plenty of challenger banks offering customers much more competitive prices than their major bank rivals.\n\nSpringall has urged savers to stay alert to the best deals offered by challenger banks if they haven't done so in the last few months.\n\nShe said: \"The average rate paid across the biggest high street banks is 2.01%, which is less than the current market average easy-access rate across all savings providers. The last time the base rate rose was in August 2023, by 0.25%; six months later, the average easy-access rate rose to 3.17%, but again, the average rate paid across the biggest high street banks was less, at 2.04%.\n\n\"There are expectations for the base rate to fall before the year is over, so those savers who want a guaranteed return would be wise to consider either a fixed rate bond or ISA for a guaranteed return.\n\n\"It is also imperative that savers with bigger pots keep an eye on whether they are due to breach their Personal Savings Allowance [PSA], and if they haven't already, consider utilising their ISA allowance to protect their money from tax.\"\n\nThe finance expert also warned for savers to brace themselves for a dip in attractive savings rates once the base rate eventually lowers.\n\nShe added: \"Once a base rate cut happens, it can have a big impact on the variable rate market in a short time frame, but can also trigger providers to adjust fixed rates as a consequence.\"", "source": {"uri": "yourmoney.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Your Money"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_browning@yourmoney.com", "name": "Matt Browning", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Household"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individual savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Challenger bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.yourmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/shutterstock_518017405-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

That progress came after four more Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2023. Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride, CFA suggests rate cuts may be possible in 2024, which could benefit personal loan rates if the economy doesn't head into a recession.\n\nMcBride explains the relationship between personal loan rates, the U.S. economy and a potential drop in the federal funds rate, which sits at 5.25-5.5 as of the meeting on July 31, 2024.\n\nAs inflation shows signs of slowing, borrowers may see lower personal loan rates in 2024. Any Fed cuts will likely have a direct effect on personal loan rates. \"Personal loans are pegged to short term interest rates like the prime rate that moves in concert with Fed interest rate cuts,\" McBride explains.\n\nIncreases in personal loan rates were more stable in 2023, following the lead of four Fed rate hikes throughout the year. Although the Fed paused its rate hike campaign in July, personal loan rates continued to creep higher into the end of the year.\n\nDespite higher rates, total unsecured personal loan balances set a new record, growing to $241 billion by the third quarter of 2023, according to TransUnion data. Consumers are also borrowing more with the average personal loan balance rising to $11,281 per consumer, setting another record milestone.\n\nAlthough new personal loan originations were down, they're still higher than they were in the pre-pandemic period -- a sign that consumer demand for personal loans hasn't diminished in the face of persistent rate increases.\n\nOverall, personal loan requirements have been tightening since the fourth quarter of 2022. Whether personal loan lending standards will tighten further depends on how the economy fares in 2024. \"If the economy goes into a recession in 2024, those tight credit conditions are going to persist and they're going to get even tighter,\" McBride says.\n\nRecent TransUnion data showed a 15 percent drop in overall personal loan originations in the third quarter of 2023 compared to 2022, which indicates lenders may be focusing on less risky borrowers. On the other hand, originations of personal loans for excellent credit spiked by 20 percent versus 2022, which means lenders may prefer lending to borrowers on excellent financing footing.\n\nMcBride suggests a healthy economy may also have a positive impact on getting approved for a personal loan, even if interest rates fall. \"If the economy averts a recession, then that really helps from a credit availability standpoint on personal loans.\"\n\nHowever, if a weaker economy is the reason for the Fed rate cuts, personal loan rates may not drop, and loan approval could become much more difficult. \"If the Fed's cutting rates because the economy rolled over, you're not necessarily going to see that translating into lower rates because credit's going to be tightening,\" McBride adds.\n\nThe best plan is to reduce as much expensive debt as possible. McBride recommends consumers pay down high-cost debt, like credit cards or high-rate personal loans, as rates may remain elevated throughout 2024.\n\nDespite the encouraging prospect of the Fed cutting rates after 11 consecutive rate hikes, rates will likely remain high. Consumers shouldn't expect a rapid drop in rates anytime soon.\n\nConsider beefing up your emergency savings to avoid high-cost debt in the future. Having extra savings provides a buffer if unexpected expenses arise, and reduces the likelihood you'll need to borrow to make ends meet.\n\nGetting a new personal loan may be a way to improve your financial situation in 2024, especially if you paid off multiple credit card debts in 2023 with a debt consolidation loan. \"You may be able to refinance a personal loan that was taken out at a much higher rate at a more competitive rate now that your credit has improved,\" McBride says.", "source": {"uri": "bankrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bankrate.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denny_ceizyk@bankrate.com", "name": "Denny Ceizyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankrate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_consolidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt consolidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.bankrate.com/2023/12/21130948/Central-personal-loan-rates-forecast.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Inflation has fallen from its peak of 11pc in October 2022 to hit the Bank of England's 2pc target in May.\n\nAnother cut is widely expected before the end of the year, which could have profound implications for consumers and businesses. For example, some companies directly benefit from paying less interest on their debt, while others profit from their customers having more cash in the bank as mortgage rates come down.\n\nFinally, lower interest rates provide a boost to the valuations of certain companies, such as those that are prized not for their profits today but the prospects of their future earnings. These are worth more if inflation and rates are expected to fall.\n\nSo, which stocks stand to benefit? Here are five to consider.\n\nConsumer confidence\n\nUnilever is one consumer-facing business that should in theory profit from Britons feeling more willing and able to spend.\n\nAlan Dobbie, a fund manager at Rathbones Asset Management, says the owner of the Dove and Hellmann's brands should perform better if rates fall. This is because Unilever's reliable dividend competes with the stable income paid out by bonds.\n\nWhen interest rates drop, typically bond yields also fall (as the two are highly correlated), so the stock's stable, growing revenues and regular dividend become even more attractive to investors.\n\nMr Dobbie also feels positive about the new management team's strategy, which focuses on doing fewer things better. This explains the company's decision to spin off its ice cream unit, which includes Ben & Jerry's.\n\nHe says: \"They are making pretty big, bold moves. As a result, there has been a big increase in the number of analysts upgrading the stock in recent months.\"\n\nPower your portfolio\n\nThe future steady cash flows of utility companies also become more attractive to investors when interest rates and bond yields fall. National Grid, which operates the UK's electricity and gas transmission network, is Mr Dobbie's top choice in this sector.\n\nHe says: \"It has a great combination of defensive revenue streams, a really attractive growth profile and an inflation-linked dividend that yields close to 6pc.\"\n\nLower interest rates will also spell good news for the company's high debt pile, ultimately reducing the interest payable on that debt.\n\nBuilding boost\n\nCompanies that operate in the housing market are obvious beneficiaries of a lower base rate. These stocks are very sensitive to interest rates, as we saw through the course of 2022, when their share prices plummeted as rates started to rise.\n\nSince early 2022, homeowners have felt the pinch as mortgage rates increased and it became less affordable to buy a new home.\n\nIf the base rate were to fall, the reverse would happen.\n\nIndriatti van Hien, manager of the Henderson Smaller Companies investment trust, points to Labour's stated intention to get Britain building again. The Government wants 1.5 million new homes built over the next five years, with planning reform labelled a key priority.\n\nWith this in mind, Ms van Hien and co-manager Neil Hermon highlight housebuilder Bellway as one to watch. The company has an experienced management team, conservative finances and scope to increase the number of homes it can build. It also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.9pc.\n\nMr Hermon adds: \"The shares look inexpensive trading below 'book value'. Its recent approach to acquire Crest Nicholson and secure its southern-focused land bank looks well timed.\"\n\nHome improvements\n\nBeyond housebuilders, building materials suppliers and DIY retailers have the potential to profit from an uptick in construction and home improvements.\n\n\"When rates go down, the value of your house actually goes up,\" says Ms van Hien. \"One reason is that more people can afford it and that has a strong wealth effect. If you think your house is worth more or has stopped going down in value, you are more likely to spend money on your home.\"\n\nIn her opinion, DIY giant Wickes has the potential to benefit from lower mortgage rates and improved consumer sentiment.\n\nMs van Hien explains: \"It is also a very cheap stock. It is undervalued relative to the strength of its balance sheet and the fact it is taking market share.\"\n\nBoost for UK shares\n\nFinally, DIY investment platforms, asset management and wealth management companies have the potential to see money flowing in as falling savings rates cause consumers to switch to the stock market from cash on deposit for better returns.\n\nHere, Jonathan Brown, a fund manager at Invesco, highlights investment platform AJ Bell. It stands to benefit from consumers having more cash to invest if mortgage rates come down. Growth in the assets invested via its platform also equate to higher fees for the business.\n\nHe adds: \"They are effectively a geared play on the stock market. They have started to see the benefit of recovering markets too.\"\n\nRecommended\n\nSavings rates are destined to fall - here's where to invest now Read more", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_levy@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Danielle Levy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Dobbie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Dobbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilever", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unilever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathbones", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rathbones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_&_Jerry's", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben & Jerry's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Grid_(Great_Britain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Grid (Great Britain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ice cream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crest_Nicholson", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crest Nicholson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2024/07/31/TELEMMGLPICT000387799953_17224443992930_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYS1acP-ch22p5qESP2v6g4TQXy-JIYeNHjz2OazuOpE.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Inflation has fallen from its peak of 11pc in October 2022 to hit the Bank of England's 2pc target in May.\n\nAnother cut is widely expected before the end of the year, which could have profound implications for consumers and businesses. For example, some companies directly benefit from paying less interest on their debt, while others profit from their customers having more cash in the bank as mortgage rates come down.\n\nFinally, lower interest rates provide a boost to the valuations of certain companies, such as those that are prized not for their profits today but the prospects of their future earnings.

From the fundamentals of central bank operations to the subtle nuances of the carry trade, uncover how they shape the global financial tapestry, dictating economic outcomes and trader fortunes.\n\nUnderstanding Interest Rates\n\nAn interest rate is the cost of borrowing money or the return earned from lending, expressed as a percentage. Two primary types dominate the discourse:\n\nCentral Bank Interest Rates\n\nSet by monetary authorities like the Federal Reserve, these rates often serve as the benchmark for short-term lending between banks. For instance, the federal funds rate in the US dictates interbank loans overnight, influencing liquidity and, by extension, currency value.\n\nMarket Interest Rates\n\nThink LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) - the rate at which banks lend to each other in the international interbank market. It, influenced by supply and demand dynamics, often fluctuates daily, making it a vital metric for traders who delve into currency swaps or forward rate agreements.\n\nIn trading currency pairs, interest rates aren't mere numbers - they're indicators dictating strength, investment flows, and overall economic health.\n\nInterest Rates as Market Drivers\n\nIn forex, interest rates emerge as crucial influencers. Acting as catalysts, they shape currency values, guide investment flows, and mould strategies traders employ.\n\nFor those looking to take advantage of these forces, using a platform like FXOpen's TickTrader offers a competitive edge, ensuring traders have access to real-time data and advanced trading tools.\n\nDecoding Interest Rates in Forex Market Trends\n\nInterest rates wield enormous power in the global financial theatre, particularly in the dynamics of forex trading. One of the clearest relationships observed is between high interest rates and currencies. Elevated rates act as a magnet for foreign capital since investors constantly scout for better returns. This inflow requires the purchase of the country's currency, leading to its appreciation.\n\nCarry Trade and Interest Dynamics\n\nOne such tactic to capitalise on rate disparities is the carry trade. Traders borrow funds in a currency with low rates and invest it in a currency yielding higher returns. The difference or the \"carry\" becomes their profit. The symbiotic relationship between interest rates and forex is deeply evident here. A sound grasp of the nuances of this strategy can lead to lucrative opportunities for seasoned traders.\n\nInterest Differentials: The Subtle Nuances\n\nEven minor variations in rates across nations can offer significant opportunities. These differentials between currency pairs influence their relative strengths. For instance, if Country A starts offering higher interest rates than Country B, it could lead to an appreciation of Country A's currency, interest rates playing the central role. Savvy traders continually analyse these differentials, strategising their trades to capitalise on the anticipated market movements.\n\nCentral Banks and Monetary Policy\n\nCentral banks hold a significant position in steering a nation's economic direction. One of their critical levers is the setting of interest rates. They directly impact the money supply and, subsequently, inflation levels.\n\nWhen inflation surges beyond targeted levels, central banks may raise rates to rein it in, as this will typically reduce consumer borrowing and spending. Conversely, when economies face downturns, they might reduce them, promoting borrowing and investment and aiming to boost economic activity. Thus, the delicate balance between inflation rates and interest rates is a testament to the central authorities' pivotal role in economic stability.\n\nMonetary Policy Tools: Shaping the Financial Landscape\n\nCentral banks use a variety of tools to implement their monetary policies:\n\nOpen Market Operations\n\nBy buying or selling government securities, these banks control the money circulating in the economy. Selling securities pulls money out of the market, leading to higher interest rates. Conversely, purchasing them injects money, pushing rates down.\n\nReserve Requirements\n\nBy altering the amount of money banks need to hold in reserve, central banks can influence the amount available for loans. A higher reserve means fewer loans, resulting in higher rates and vice versa.\n\nForward Guidance and Quantitative Easing\n\nThese are more nuanced tools. Forward guidance involves bank governors communicating their future plans, providing the market with a sense of direction. Quantitative easing, on the other hand, involves large-scale asset purchases to increase money supply and lower interest rates.\n\nEconomic Indicators and Their Correlation with Interest Rates\n\nEconomic indicators provide valuable insights into a country's financial health, and their fluctuations often influence monetary policy decisions. For instance, when inflation surpasses target levels, central banks might consider hiking them to temper the rising prices, leading to an interplay between foreign exchange and interest rates.\n\nA strong GDP growth signals a thriving economy, which might attract foreign investments. These inflows usually put upward pressure on the domestic currency. However, if the bank responds by raising rates, this may further amplify its strength. Thus, the effect of increasing interest rates on currency is often profound, making it a focal point for forex traders.\n\nSimilarly, employment metrics, consumer sentiment, and manufacturing output are all vital indicators that economists monitor. Changes in these metrics might hint at upcoming monetary policy adjustments.\n\nLastly, there are foreign currency loans and interest rates. When global rates are low, corporations might engage in foreign currency loans, seeking cheaper financing options. However, shifts in these rates can impact the cost of servicing these loans, leading to potential forex market volatility.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe dance between forex and interest rates is both complex and fascinating. As we've seen, interest rate trading offers profound insights and opportunities for those in the foreign exchange arena. For those eager to navigate these waters and capitalise on the intricate interplay of rates and currencies, opening an FXOpen account can be the gateway to informed, strategic trading in this dynamic market.\n\nThis article represents the opinion of the Companies operating under the FXOpen brand only.

Officials are now grappling with when they should take their foot off the brake. They entered 2024 expecting to reduce rates at least three times this year, but have repeatedly pushed back their plans, even though inflation eased in April, May and June.\n\nHigher interest rates tend to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which then slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. Higher rates helped to push the average rate on 30-year mortgages above 8% for the first time in decades last year. Borrowing costs for everything from home equity lines of credit, auto loans and credit cards have also spiked.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "source": {"uri": "foxbusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Business"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_henney@foxbusiness.com", "name": "Megan Henney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home equity line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1024/512/powell-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

They must be pretty confident with their predictions for what is going to happen with interest rates... that can only be a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nTax cuts had also been reflected in the calculators that lenders used, he said.\n\n\"Effectively it's showing you'll have that bit of extra money available.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-income_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt-to-income ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--DGlk4jMG--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1673994271/4LEZR37_banks_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The last reduction in base rate took place in 2020 amid the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nIain McKenzie, CEO of The Guild of Property Professionals comments:\n\n\"Many will breathe a sigh of relief following the Bank of England's decision to cut the rate from a 16-year high of 5.25%. The cut will have a positive impact for both mortgaged homeowners and loan-dependent prospective buyers alike.\n\n\"While headline inflation fell to the Bank's target of 2% in May, the decision to cut the rate was delayed due to services inflation remaining stubbornly high. While services inflation is still high, the BoE is looking at the long-term and economic growth.\n\n\"Despite the elevated interest rate environment we have experienced over the past few years, a more optimistic overall economic outlook continues to have a positive impact on confidence in the market. While many adopted a wait-and-see approach in the period running up to the general election, it is expected that we should start to see transactions levels improve in the second half of the year. The rate cut should be a further shot in the arm for the market.\"\n\nSam Mitchell, CEO of Purplebricks, said:\n\n\"The housing market is finally kicking back into action following a pause for breath around the General Election. The Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates today will supercharge this recovery.\n\n\"Already, buyers are leaving the market lull behind to forge ahead with purchasing decisions. However, for first-time buyers, the primary challenge remains firmly in place: the rental market is still a complete mess. Labour will need to push ahead with their plans to 'get Britain building' and construct more social housing if it's to lower the barriers to homeownership for first-time buyers. The hope is that these measures, when combined with rates coming down for landlords, should make the rental market more bearable for tenants and help them save for a deposit to finally become a homeowner.\"\n\nTim Bannister, Rightmove's property expert said:\n\n\"This year we've seen signs that more people have adjusted to higher mortgage rate levels and generally, if they can, have been getting on with moves. The property market has been resilient, and even through the uncertainty of the recent election campaign, we saw home-moving activity continue on trend.

Mortgage and Property professionals react to today's cut in UK interest rates - IFA Magazine", "body": "With so many interest rate rises since the record low of 0.1% in December 2021, there has been considerable pain for borrowers and businesses as they struggle to cope with the pain from the increased cost of debt.\n\nHowever, today's cut was clearly a knife-edge decision for the MPC. The seeds of doubt were mainly because services inflation has remained stubbornly above target, giving concern that this might fuel the inflation fire, and lead to the headline rate resuming an upward path in the months ahead.\n\nSharing their reaction to today's interest rate cut news, mortgage and property professionals have been telling us what it means for the economy, for hard-pressed borrowers, for businesses and for the property market overall as follows:\n\nBen Waugh, Managing Director, more2life, said: \"As many industry experts predicted, the market has triumphed over recent challenges, prompting the Bank of England to cut its central rate today. Naturally, this is great news for homebuyers and those refinancing residential mortgages, as borrowing costs become more affordable. Today's announcement will likely prove a catalyst for more activity in the coming weeks and months. With a range of more affordable options now available, advisers will play a crucial role in helping borrowers cut through the noise and secure the best deal for a stable financial future.\"\n\nKevin Shaw, National Sales Managing Director at LRG said: \"The reduction in interest rates announced by the Bank of England today is good news for the property industry and the millions of people wishing to move, remortgage or get onto the housing ladder after a period of uncertainty. LRG has seen positive trading in July, with sales figures strong and an increasing number of new applicants registering. Today's decision is a strong indication that growth is here to stay.\n\n\"There's lot of pent-up demand in the market after months of political uncertainty and today's decision on rates is the starting pistol that we've been waiting for. After a good July, we look forward to an even better August and the likelihood, in many cases, of getting people into their new homes before Christmas.\"\n\nParesh Raja, CEO of Market Financial Solutions, said: \"The base rate has finally been cut, easing the barriers that have constrained the UK property market amid two years of high inflation and borrowing costs. I expect to see increased market activity in the coming weeks as a result.\n\n\"In recent months, we've seen a growing sense of optimism. With property prices and the volume of homes coming onto the market on the rise, today's decision will likely encourage investors who have been holding back to re-engage. Despite the rate cut, however, borrowing costs remain extremely high, so flexibility for borrowers and brokers remains essential.\n\n\"Therefore, any potential rebound in the UK property market will hinge on the specialist lending sector. A recent survey shows that a substantial majority of bridging lenders expect loan volumes to rise over the next year. Given the uncertainty about future rate cuts, lenders should be offering a range of product options to accommodate brokers' and borrowers' needs and interest rate expectations. This will help them take full advantage of the opportunities created by the rate cut, even if further rate changes do not occur immediately.\"\n\nJohn Phillips, CEO of Just Mortgages and Spicerhaart, said: \"At long last, the Bank of England has finally made the right decision and cut the base rate. The reality is this needed to happen, not just to breathe some life into the economy, but to help take some of the pressure off borrowers - particularly those on a tracker or on SVR.\n\n\"While we may not see lenders react instantly to today's news - as many have already priced in a cut and made reductions accordingly - it's likely to be the starting pistol for increased competition amongst lenders. All have their own targets to hit and need to lend to make money, so it's only right to expect greater activity as they look to increase volumes and market share.\n\n\"Today's news will likely be the impetus for many potential borrowers or movers to return to the market and get their plans back on track. If there's ever been a time for brokers to be proactive and present in their local community, this is certainly it. As potential clients look to navigate a changing market, that whole of market access offered by a broker is hugely valuable. It's our job to remind borrowers of this.\"\n\nJoe Pepper, UK Chief Executive Officer, PEXA, said: \"The Bank of England's decision to cut the base rate today has offered some reprieve following almost a year of the highest rates in 16 years. The latest inflation data has clearly generated enough confidence in the economy for the MPC to alleviate the strain on borrowers who we now expect to jump at the chance to remortgage.\n\n\"As such, we anticipate a significant surge in activity. About 1.6 million remortgage deals are expected to expire this year, and as better deals from lenders get priced in, we will see borrowers race to secure the best rates. On top of this, Labour's National Planning Policy Framework promises to flood the market with affordable home as early as this autumn.\n\n\"All of this is good news for borrowers, but they will not feel the benefits of it because the current conveyancing infrastructure is simply not equipped to handle a significant or sustained increase in transactions.\"\n\nMatt Harrison, Director of Sales for finova Broker said: \"Today's decision by the Bank of England to reduce the base rate to 5% is a welcome move for both businesses and consumers alike. In the current climate, this reduction offers much-needed relief and the potential to stimulate growth. For our members, lower borrowing costs can invigorate the market, drive more volume, and utilise technology to drive efficiencies as the market gains confidence.\n\n\"The decision along with the recent General Election marks a step in the right direction towards fostering a more resilient market. It is important now to leverage this opportunity providing reliable services to help our clients navigate the evolving financial landscape.\"\n\nSimon Webb, managing director of capital markets and finance at LiveMore, commented: \"Today's decision by the Bank of England to reduce the base rate to 5% marks a significant moment for the financial markets and the broader economy. This move, while somewhat anticipated given the recent economic indicators, is a clear signal of the Bank's response to emerging economic challenges and their commitment to fostering a more stable financial environment.\n\n\"We welcome this decision. The reduction is poised to bring relief to older borrowers, potentially lowering the cost of mortgages and other loans, which can stimulate spending and investment. This development offers an opportunity to reassess their financial strategies and explore the many options available to older borrowers which are often overlooked.\n\n\"However, it's essential to approach this change with a balanced perspective. While lower rates can boost economic activity, they also require vigilance in managing risks associated with borrowing and lending.\"\n\nArjan Verbeek, CEO of Perenna, said: \"Many will be rejoicing that the base rate has finally experienced its first cut since hikes began in December 2021, but in reality, consumers will soon feel shortchanged as they still won't be able to access affordable mortgage products.\n\n\"Affordability is not actually linked to the headline mortgage rate on traditional mortgage products - but to the reversion rate or Standard Variable Rate (SVR). This is why we have an affordability crisis. So regardless of which way the market moves, unless the SVR reduces, we aren't going to enter a promised land of extensive home ownership. The problems are systemic.\n\n\"Want real change? Let's start innovating and get other types of mortgage products on the market which not only help hardworking families onto the ladder but also protects them from economic shocks.\"\n\nAaron Milburn, UK Managing Director at Pepper Advantage, said: \"Today's rate cut will be extremely welcome news to borrowers, especially those that are struggling and the millions of homeowners set to refinance in the coming months. It will also help stimulate demand for new originations, which grew in Q2 to the highest levels since 2022.\n\nQ2 data from our loan portfolio shows the strongest reasons yet for optimism, with UK residential mortgages arrears down for the first time since the 2022 mini-Budget, but it is too early to celebrate. Some customer groups - notably buy-to-let mortgage holders - are showing warning signs, with buy-to-let arrears up 11% in Q2 compared to Q1.\n\nMoreover, there will be a lag before borrowers feel the benefits of this cut and the impact of slightly lower rates on monthly repayments is likely to be modest. Despite today's action, there is still a long way to go in the UK's transition from a higher-rate environment.\"\n\nJatin Ondhia, CEO of Shojin Property Partners, said: \"The consecutive months of target level inflation were clearly enough for the Bank of England to finally give the green light to reduce interest rates. The decision is a key indicator of the growing sense of economic stability and will likely open up new opportunities for investors as they reassess how to manage their portfolios.\n\n\"The impact of the high inflationary-high interest environment of the last couple of years cannot be underestimated. Homeowners have faced higher mortgage rates than at any point since the financial crisis, while developers have found it harder to access much-needed finance. Today's decision hopefully signals a clear transition away from this challenging period.\n\n\"Looking ahead, alternative investments are likely to play an increasingly important role in investors' portfolios. While the base rate has now fallen, it's from a 16-year high - interest rates still remain significantly above the levels that many landlords had become accustomed to before the hikes. As such, diversification will remain a prominent trend going forward, with a balance of savings products and lower-risk investments alongside higher-risk opportunities to provide potential for greater growth.\"\n\nBen Nichols, Interim Managing Director at RAW Capital Partners, said: \"The Bank of England clearly feel as though the perils of high inflation have been addressed by their action on interest rates and the rate hiking cycle has finally come to an end, allowing homebuyers, investors and BTL landlords alike to take a breath and plan their strategies with greater confidence and freedom. After rates reached their highest level in 16 years, today's decision will provide much-needed relief, and I expect to see an uptick in activity in the UK property market as a result.\n\n\"Recently, sellers have flocked to put their properties on the market, and estate agents have noted an increase in buyer demand. What's more, official figures show that house prices have grown for three consecutive months, while mortgage approvals have held steady near their highest level in 18 months. This indicates that the market was stabilising well before today's rate cut. In this context, the additional impetus from the MPC today is likely to encourage hesitant investors and buyers to resume their investment plans.\n\n\"However, while we can celebrate a rate cut after two years of hikes and pauses, it is important to remember that rates are still very high in comparison to where they have been in recent memory. For a surge in activity to materialise, brokers and their clients must be equipped with the tools they need to confidently execute their investment plans. Lenders must recommit to offering a wide range of bespoke and flexible financial products to support the property market's continued recovery.\"\n\nKevin Roberts, Managing Director, Legal & General Mortgage Services, commented: \"After four years, a cut to the central rate is a significant milestone, bringing with it a new and promising chapter for the property market. Lenders have already been lowering product rates in recent weeks based on long-term forecasts, putting us on course for 1.1 million sales this year. Confidence and excitement around the market has been building, and today's decision could be the catalyst for consumers to push ahead and get their home moves over the line.\n\n\"If you are weighing up a move following today's decision, a professional mortgage adviser can cut through the noise and help you navigate a complex market. Enlisting the expertise of someone with years of industry know-how is your ticket to making a decision you can be confident in. And while it might not be something typically on your radar, advisers can unlock exclusive products that would otherwise be out of reach.\"\n\nPaul Glynn, CEO, Air, comments: ''Today's base rate cut to 5% is one which will be welcomed by many, providing a much-needed boost to consumer confidence as we head towards the Autumn Budget. However, many lenders had already priced the cut into their fixed rate products ahead of time, so this won't result in any immediate downward pressure on mortgage rates more broadly.\n\n\"The market is steering towards a more manageable economic climate, but there are still difficulties that lie ahead for borrowers that aren't going to disappear immediately. Asking prices are nearing record high levels and the reality is wage growth hasn't gone nearly far enough to keep up. Later-life lending, which is affected by gilts, presents one possible solution for older homeowners who may have to manage mortgage repayments in retirement. Engaging in conversations with consumers on working solutions, including later-life lending, at an earlier stage must become the norm to secure good customer outcomes.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Starting pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversion_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reversion (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conveyancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_to_let", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buy to let"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Roberts_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Roberts (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Glynn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Glynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_&_General", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal & General"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ifamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/property-gb8b7e016b_1280-e1689851830561.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780278", "eventUri": "eng-9780278", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

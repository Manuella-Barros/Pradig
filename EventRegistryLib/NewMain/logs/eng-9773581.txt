Duncan Scott, who was aiming to add to the six Olympic medals he has already won and so become the most decorated swimmer in British Olympic history, was just outside the medals in fourth.\n\nWith Tom Dean and James Guy to be added to the team, these two individual performances underlines Britain's status as the clear favourites to defend their Olympic title in the 4x200m relay on Tuesday night.\n\nSwimming in lane one after qualifying only seventh fastest, Richards, who won the world title last year, went out quickly and was among the top three during the entire race but did not quite time his finish as effectively as Popovici. And, like Peaty 24 hours earlier, just missed out on the final touch for the wall.\n\nIn a blanket finish, Scott was only 0.15sec off gold and 0.08sec behind the American Luke Hobson in bronze.\n\nMore to follow...\n\nBritain are up to seventh in the medal table now with two golds, five silvers, three bronze.\n\nSix of those medals have come today!\n\nLike Adam Peaty last night, Richards was beaten by just 0.02 seconds. Brutal!\n\nPopovici steals it by two-hundredths of a second. Richards looked like he had it right to the end but must settle for silver.\n\nHobson takes bronze for USA.\n\nPopovici is back up to second. It will be close to the line.\n\nRichards is up to second, charging after Maertens. Popovici is in third.\n\nMaertens taps first with Popovici and Richards in third and in good shape.\n\nThe swimmers walk out for the latest final of the night. Plenty of support for Richards and Scott.\n\nThe buzzer goes off and the swimmers jump in for the final.\n\nRomanian 19-year-old David Popovici was fastest into the men's 200m freestyle final with a time of 1:44.53, nearly half a second quicker than Briton Scott.\n\nRichards and Scott are primed to jump into the pool at 7.41pm.\n\nBy Tom Morgan\n\nAdam Peaty has tested positive for Covid after feeling unwell prior to missing out on gold in the men's 100 metre breaststroke final, Team GB have announced.\n\nPeaty, 29, had been left in tears after settling for Olympic silver as Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi snatched victory in Paris on Sunday night.\n\nTeam GB have now confirmed in a statement that Peaty was already feeling ill. \"In the hours after the final, his symptoms became worse and he was tested for Covid early on Monday morning,\" the team added. \"He tested positive at that point.\"\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage of the men's 200m freestyle swimming final which features Britons Matthew Richards and Duncan Scott.\n\nParis is Scott's third Games and the 27-year-old, who has yet to win an individual Olympic gold, has every chance of adding to his collection of six medals.\n\nHe won 200 freestyle, 200 individual medley and 4x100 individual medley silver at the Tokyo Olympics. He also won two relay silvers at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\n\"I'm going to go in with quite an open mind. I know if I'm able to swim at my best in each of the events, I'm going to give myself quite a good chance,\" said the Scot, who set personal bests in all his finals in Tokyo.\n\n\"At 27 I think I'm still pretty young in the sport, so there's still plenty of life in that with how I've been performing over the last few years. I think there's still plenty of improvement. For me something that really motivates me is can I continually improve and get better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Richards believes he is in the best shape of his life.\n\nAt the Tokyo Games, Richards won gold in men's 4x200 metres freestyle relay.\n\nRichards followed up a win in the 200m freestyle at last year's World Championships by beating Scott in April's Olympic trials.\n\nAnd the 21-year-old Welshman says he is raring to go in the French capital.\n\n\"I want it more now than I ever did,\" he said. \"What happened in Tokyo was fantastic and it was a great result but I'm definitely ready to step on now, move that forward and improve on that performance.\n\n\"I see pressure as a privilege - you only feel it when you've done something that makes you deserve that pressure. I know from what I've done in training and in the last year, I've earned some pressure.\n\n\"I'm putting pressure on myself, I'm excited, I know I'm in the best shape I've ever been in by a mile, I'm ready to get out there and race. I'm just in a really good place where I'm loving what I'm doing.\n\n\"When you're in that kind of place, you're almost in a place where you're invincible because I'm doing what I love and there's nothing that can stop me from doing what I love right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Popovici", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dean_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Dean (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Guy_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Guy (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Martinenghi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Martinenghi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINA_World_Aquatics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FINA World Aquatics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6j9Irlc8ylloxyyjunGEJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/7ffdfe764036d02a88713e66ad52a570", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773581", "eventUri": "eng-9773581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Despite the official timings, the 21-year-old believed he had touched the wall first. Richards accepted the verdict, but called it \"excruciatingly painful'.\n\nTeam GB swimmer Matt Richards took home a silver medal in the men's 200m freestyle at the Paris Olympics on Monday evening. However, the 21-year-old believes he was wrongly denied a gold medal, insisting that he had touched the wall first - ahead of declared winner David Popovici of Romania.\n\nAfter a slightly disappointing performance in his semi-final, Richards found himself in lane 1 for the final. That berth put the Worcester man at a disadvantage before even getting in the pool, as it meant he would have to swim a solo race away from other top contenders, while also dealing with waves coming from other lanes and water bouncing back from the pool wall.\n\nDespite this, though, he still put in a monster performance and with ten metres to go he was the narrow leader of the race. According to the official timings, though, he was pipped right at the end by 0.02 seconds by 19-year-old Popovici. With his victory, Popovici became the first ever Romanian man to win gold in swimming.\n\nThe 200m freestyle was Richards' first ever individual event at the Olympics so to walk away with a silver medal is incredibly impressive. With that said, the Brit admitted he was convinced he had touched the wall ahead of Popovici when speaking to BBC Sport.\n\nMatt Richards Relives 'Excruiating' Finish to His First Olympic Final Team GB youngster tried to hide his disappointment at having to settle for a silver medal\n\n\"I thought I had got it, it felt as if I had touched it first. The time says differently.\"\n\nRichards showed maturity beyond his years as he reasoned: \"It is not a sport that is up for debate, it is black and white. It wasn't my best finish, I would be lying if I said it was fantastic. We move on, we get better and try to get it next time.\"\n\nHe was also asked how much of a difference it made being in lane 1. To that query, the silver-medal winner answered: \"It's not ideal as you can end up on the wrong side of it.\" In this case, \"it\" ended up being an Olympic gold medal.\n\nFootage Shows Just How Close Richards was to Winning Olympic Gold\n\nBBC pundits were in agreement that it had looked as though Richards had done enough to claim the top prize. The gap between the top two was razor-thin. It's tough to say that the Brit was definitely robbed of the win, but it was desperately close.\n\nAdrian Moorhouse said that the Team GB star \"did everything he could have done\" and Moorhouse's colleague Steve Parry added that even the winner, Popovici \"had a bemused look on his face\" and that the race \"was just bonkers\".\n\nIn his interview after the race, Richards took the positives as he outlined that he still has the 100m freestyle semi-final to compete in, as well as the 4x200m freestyle relay final. Richards will be accompanied by Duncan Scott for Team GB in that final.\n\nScott was very unlucky to miss out on a medal as he placed in 4th, just behind Luke Hobson of the USA by less than 0.2 seconds. He will be looking to add to his six Olympic gold medals in the relay, as he won four medals in Tokyo three years ago, with one of them being gold, having previously won two silvers at Rio 2016.\n\nRelated Swimmer Blames Olympic Village Conditions for Missing out on Gold\n\nAriarne Titmus has been criticised by her own coach for her negative comments about the village...", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Popovici", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatics_at_the_2006_Commonwealth_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aquatics at the 2006 Commonwealth Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Parry_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Parry (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Moorhouse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Moorhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariarne_Titmus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariarne Titmus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/team-gb-athlete-denied-gold.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773581", "eventUri": "eng-9773581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Now Matt Richards. Two silver medals and both denied on the final touch by only two hundredths of a second. At just 21, Richards might be at the opposite end of his career to Peaty but there is more than a passing similarity in his copious hunger and, with further opportunities looming - not least in the 4x200 metre relay on Tuesday night - a gold medal may very well soon follow.\n\nIt was also a relief to hear that his parents, Amanda and Simon, had made it inside La D\u00e9fense Arena for their son's first individual Olympic final in the 200m freestyle.\n\nThey had hit out at Olympic organisers last month after initially losing thousands of pounds on tickets that turned out to be fake and called on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to provide tickets to the families of competing athletes. \"We're just a normal working family - we couldn't afford to buy tickets for everything he's swimming in,\" said Amanda.\n\nAfter raising the issue in the media, it is understood that the family did eventually get their \u00a32,500 back before securing genuine tickets alongside Richards' fiancee, Emily, ahead of their wedding shortly later this summer.\n\nIt was earlier also reported that Tom Daley's family had to pay \u00a3400 to see him win silver, with athletes unhappy behind the scenes not just at the ongoing absence of Olympic prize money but a lack of tickets for their biggest supporters.\n\nAsked if the British swimmers had been struck by \"the curse of the 0.02sec\", Richards said: \"It seems that way. I thought I had got it - it felt as if I had touched it first. The time says differently. It is not a sport that is up for debate. It is black and white.\n\n\"To be two one hundredths off gold is excruciatingly frustrating. I'm over the moon and devastated at the same time. But I can't be too disappointed. If anything it has added more fire to my belly.\"\n\nRichards had been part of the British 4x200m team that won relay gold in Tokyo and after winning a World Championship double in the relay and individual events last year, was only denied here by David Popovici's rapid finish. Duncan Scott, who was aiming to add to the six Olympic medals he has previously already won, was just outside the medals in fourth.\n\nWith 2021 double Olympic champion Tom Dean and James Guy to be added to the team, Scott is likely to correct that on Tuesday and will also have further opportunities in the men's 200m individual medley and various relays.\n\nScott needs only one more medal to become Team GB's most decorated Olympic swimmer and join Sir Chris Hoy on seven medals. The respective eight and nine that have been won by Sir Bradley Wiggins and Sir Jason Kenny are also in view.\n\nThe individual performances of Richards and Scott also underlines Britain's status as the clear favorites to defend their Olympic title with their expected big showdown against the USA in the 4x200m relay.\n\nSwimming in lane one after qualifying only seventh fastest, Richards made an aggressive start and was among the top three throughout the entire race but did not quite time his finish as effectively as Popovici. In a blanket finish, Scott was only 0.15sec off gold and 0.08sec behind the American Luke Hobson in bronze.\n\nRichards, who improvised to keep training during the Covid lockdown by using a paddling pool with a harness attached to his parents' garage door, believes that losing by such a fine margin will ultimately help his career.\n\n\"It's something that I've dreamt of since I was a little boy,\" he said. \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't dreaming of being one step higher on the podium. But my week's not done. It's made me hungrier than ever. I'm young, I'm 21. I'm planning on being in the sport for at least another 10 years.\"\n\nLike Scott, Freya Colbert earlier also just missed out on a medal, finishing fourth in the women's 400m individual medley.\n\nBritain are up to seventh in the medal table now with two golds, five silvers, three bronze.\n\nSix of those medals have come today!\n\nLike Adam Peaty last night, Richards was beaten by just 0.02 seconds. Brutal!\n\nPopovici steals it by two-hundredths of a second. Richards looked like he had it right to the end but must settle for silver.\n\nHobson takes bronze for USA.\n\nPopovici is back up to second. It will be close to the line.\n\nRichards is up to second, charging after Maertens. Popovici is in third.\n\nMaertens taps first with Popovici and Richards in third and in good shape.\n\nThe swimmers walk out for the latest final of the night. Plenty of support for Richards and Scott.\n\nThe buzzer goes off and the swimmers jump in for the final.\n\nRomanian 19-year-old David Popovici was fastest into the men's 200m freestyle final with a time of 1:44.53, nearly half a second quicker than Briton Scott.\n\nRichards and Scott are primed to jump into the pool at 7.41pm.\n\nBy Tom Morgan\n\nAdam Peaty has tested positive for Covid after feeling unwell prior to missing out on gold in the men's 100 metre breaststroke final, Team GB have announced.\n\nPeaty, 29, had been left in tears after settling for Olympic silver as Italy's Nicolo Martinenghi snatched victory in Paris on Sunday night.\n\nTeam GB have now confirmed in a statement that Peaty was already feeling ill. \"In the hours after the final, his symptoms became worse and he was tested for Covid early on Monday morning,\" the team added. \"He tested positive at that point.\"\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage of the men's 200m freestyle swimming final which features Britons Matthew Richards and Duncan Scott.\n\nParis is Scott's third Games and the 27-year-old, who has yet to win an individual Olympic gold, has every chance of adding to his collection of six medals.\n\nHe won 200 freestyle, 200 individual medley and 4x100 individual medley silver at the Tokyo Olympics. He also won two relay silvers at the 2016 Rio Games.\n\n\"I'm going to go in with quite an open mind. I know if I'm able to swim at my best in each of the events, I'm going to give myself quite a good chance,\" said the Scot, who set personal bests in all his finals in Tokyo.\n\n\"At 27 I think I'm still pretty young in the sport, so there's still plenty of life in that with how I've been performing over the last few years. I think there's still plenty of improvement. For me something that really motivates me is can I continually improve and get better.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Richards believes he is in the best shape of his life.\n\nAt the Tokyo Games, Richards won gold in men's 4x200 metres freestyle relay.\n\nRichards followed up a win in the 200m freestyle at last year's World Championships by beating Scott in April's Olympic trials.\n\nAnd the 21-year-old Welshman says he is raring to go in the French capital.\n\n\"I want it more now than I ever did,\" he said. \"What happened in Tokyo was fantastic and it was a great result but I'm definitely ready to step on now, move that forward and improve on that performance.\n\n\"I see pressure as a privilege - you only feel it when you've done something that makes you deserve that pressure. I know from what I've done in training and in the last year, I've earned some pressure.\n\n\"I'm putting pressure on myself, I'm excited, I know I'm in the best shape I've ever been in by a mile, I'm ready to get out there and race. I'm just in a really good place where I'm loving what I'm doing.\n\n\"When you're in that kind of place, you're almost in a place where you're invincible because I'm doing what I love and there's nothing that can stop me from doing what I love right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

My first individual [event] at an Olympic Games.\n\n\"Obviously two one hundredths off gold is excruciatingly frustrating. If anything it has added more fire to my belly.\"\n\nThe medal was Team GB's sixth of day three and takes their overall total to 10.\n\nIn the previous race, Britain's Freya Colbert was fourth in the 400m medley, missing out on a medal by 0.74 seconds, as 17-year-old Canadian sensation Summer McIntosh won the first of what will surely be many Olympic golds.\n\nRichards was part of Great Britain's 4x200m relay team that won gold in Tokyo, as was Scott, but this was his first individual Olympic medal.\n\nRichards won the 2023 world title last year but had not hit top form in Paris.\n\nHe and Scott were in the 100m freestyle relay quartet that finished fifth on day one and his middling semi-final time left him in an outside lane, where the waves are bigger and quick times rarely swum.\n\nBut he overcame that expertly and was in contention throughout.\n\nPopovici, who announced himself in 2022, aged 17, by winning the 100m and 200m gold at the World Championships, looked to be struggling at the start of the fourth and final length but he dug deep, getting the crucial first touch.\n\n\"I misjudged the semi-final a bit,\" Richards said. \"Being out there meant I was a little bit out of the race and I had to swim on my own.\n\n\"It is all learning. I want another 10 years before even thinking about hanging the goggles up.\"\n\nScott was bidding for a seventh Olympic medal, another to go with his relay gold and five silvers, but was beaten to bronze by 0.08 seconds.\n\nSuch is Britain's strength in depth in this event, Olympic champion Tom Dean was beaten by Richards and Scott at the trials in April and did not qualify.\n\nThe trio will now unite on Tuesday as they bid to defend their relay title, first in the morning heats, although Richards or Scott could be rested before a potential final at 21:01 BST.\n\nRichards also has the 100m freestyle starting on Tuesday, in which he will hope to be among the medals again.\n\n\"Myself and Duncan, second and fourth, I am gutted for him, just missing out on a medal,\" Richards said.",

I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't dreaming of being one step higher on the podium.\n\n\"That's down to my finish, my technical ability to get the pressure into the wall. If I got my hand on there first but didn't put enough pressure through the wall, that's not the wall's fault, it's mine.\n\n\"That's something I've got to work on and make sure it doesn't happen again. I'm young, I plan on being in the sport at least another 10 years yet, so every one of these little lessons I can learn is hugely valuable.\n\n\"I did think I'd done enough, coming down that last 25, it did feel to me like I'd touched the wall but it's not a sport of subjection, it's black and white - it's numbers and the scoreboard doesn't lie.\"\n\nHe could turn the tables on Popovici across the 100m distance, with the heats starting on Tuesday morning, while in the evening session, Richards and Team GB are defending champions and firm favourites for the men's 4x200m freestyle relay.\n\n\"I probably needed to be more in the middle of the race than that tonight and, again, that's down to my error last night in the semi-finals, I left that a little bit too fine,\" Richards said.\n\n\"But it wasn't meant to be. To get a silver medal is still fantastic, I've got a lot more to do this week, there's still a lot of races, we'll go again.\n\n\"There's lots of lessons I can learn from the racing, I loved every minute of that tonight, it was a proper dogfight and a real battle that came down to the finish.\n\nDuncan Scott, who alongside Richards qualified for the event at the expense of compatriot and Tokyo 2020 champion Tom Dean, was unable to make it a British double on the podium.\n\nScott, runner-up to Dean in Japan, was 0.08 secs adrift of bronze medallist Luke Hobson and 0.15s of Popovici.\n\nMoments earlier, Freya Colbert missed out on a medal of her own, finishing fourth in the women's 400m individual medley, with Scotland's Katie Shanahan seventh.\n\nColbert was in bronze position with 100m to go but Emma Weyant overhauled her in the freestyle leg as 17-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, dubbed swimming's next superstar, claimed her first Olympic gold medal.\n\nAngharad Evans finished sixth in the women's 100m breaststroke final while Oliver Morgan was eighth in the men's 100m backstroke.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Popovici", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Swimming_Championships_-_200_metres_freestyle_winners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Swimming Championships -

And Richards thought he had pipped Popovici in the final moments, but for the second consecutive night a British swimmer was just short.\n\nBBC commentators deliberated whether Richards had actually touched the wall first, and while Richards thought he had done so, he did accept the result of the race.\n\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I thought I had got it, it felt as if I had touched it first. The time says differently. It is not a sport that is up for debate, it is black and white. It wasn't my best finish, I would be lying if I said it was fantastic. We move on, we get better and try to get it next time.\"\n\nThere was more agony for the British team as well, with Duncan Scott narrowly missing out on a podium place after finishing fourth. Richards added: \"Gutted for Duncan [Scott], myself and him in second and fourth, just missing out on the medal he deserves it more than anyone - that bodes really well for our 4x200m.\"\n\nAttention now turns to the relays and with Richards and Scott both hurting, the former believes that can help inspire them to glory. \"Look, if anything it has added more fire to my belly. I've got a lot more to come this week, the 100m is tomorrow, the 4x100m is tomorrow too. It fuels me on for the rest of the week.\"\n\nCoincidentally, Richards' defeat was the exact margin that denied Adam Peaty on Sunday night, who lost out to Italian Nicolo Martinenghi in dramatic fashion.\n\nAsked if the British team felt they have the curse of 0.02, Richards continued: \"It seems that way. I can't be too disappointed with that. My first individual at an Olympic games so to come away with a silver is great. To be two one hundredths off gold is excruciatingly frustrating.\n\nRichards was hoping to win Team GB the third goal of a magical Monday which has seen them rocket up the medal table. Tom Daley and Noah Williams started with a silver medal, before the GB's Eventing Team won the first gold of the games.\n\nAnd Tom Pidcock doubled their tally after launching a miraculous comeback in the mountain biking. Pidcock retained his title, despite a puncture leaving him way off the pace before a late charge saw him seal glory.\n\nAdam Burgess, who suffered heartbreak in Tokyo three years ago, put in a near-perfect run in the canoe slalom to land a brilliant silver.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_husband@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Ben Husband", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Popovici", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00f2_Martinenghi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00f2 Martinenghi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Burgess", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Burgess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Williams_(diver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Williams (diver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Pidcock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Pidcock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoe_slalom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoe slalom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Daley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain biking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eventing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33353216.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_JS340724924.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773581", "eventUri": "eng-9773581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It was the Welshman Matt Richards who did it, with a superb swim from lane one in the men's 200m freestyle.\n\nHe finished up just \u00adtwo-hundredths of a second behind the winner, the 19-year-old Romanian David \u00adPopovici. Which just happened to be the very same margin between Adam Peaty and Nicol\u00f2 Martinenghi, the gold medalist in the 100m breaststroke, the night before.\n\nBritish Swimming's performance director, Chris Spice, always calls this a \"\u00adfingertip sport\", but here in Paris races are being settled by the whites of the nails.\n\nThis one came down to a ferocious final 50m in which Popovici, Richards, the USA's Luke Hobson and Great Britain's Duncan Scott \u00adjockeyed back and forth for the \u00adwinning \u00admillimetre. For the briefest moment, Richards was convinced he had won it. He believed that he had touched the wall first, but hadn't managed to do it with enough force to beat Popovici.\n\nHe was good enough to admit that \"times don't care about feelings\", and said that if he really did touch before Popovici without triggering the stopclock, then it was his technique that was at fault, rather than the mechanism.\n\n\"It's not a sport where it is up for debate, it is black and white, so we'll just have to do better next time.\" He goes in the 100m free later this week. \"Obviously two-hundredths off gold is excruciatingly frustrating but look if anything it's added more fire to my belly, and I've got a lot more to go.\"\n\nIt wasn't his only mistake. He made a mess of his semi-final, which is how he ended up being drawn in an outside lane. \"It wasn't ideal, I'll be honest, that semi-final last night - I misjudged it a bit.\n\n\"Being out there meant I was a \u00adlittle bit out of the race so I had to call it on my own which in a close race like this one can mean you end up on the wrong side of it.\"\n\nStill, it could have been worse. Ask Scott. There was only .15 of a second between the first four, but it was Scott's sorry lot to be last among them. He had been dreaming about winning this race ever since he won the silver behind his teammate Tom Dean in Tokyo; he's 27, and unlike Richards, it's not necessarily clear he will get another chance. But he too has more racing to do, in the 200m medley, when he will take on L\u00e9on Marchand, and of course both go in the 4x200m relay on Tuesday.\n\nFor Richards, 21, the result was a measure of vindication for his decision to step away from the high\u2011\u00adperformance training centre at Bath University and move to Millfield in 2022. He was part of the quartet that won gold in the 4x200m relay in this event in Tokyo, along with Scott and Tom Dean, which taught him a lot about what it takes to succeed at this level. But he felt he had stalled when he failed to win a medal at the \u00adCommonwealth Games in \u00adBirmingham, and decided he needed a change of scene. For the past two years he has been working in a small training group with the coach Ryan Livingstone.\n\nSince the switch, he has won a world championship gold, and now an Olympic silver. He will need to carry on improving if he is going to beat Popovici, who is almost two years younger and, at his best, almost two seconds quicker. \u00adPopovici only took up swimming to help with his scoliosis when he was a kid, but turned out to have an extraordinary talent for it.\n\nHe is one of a handful of young swimmers making a breakthrough at these Games. Another of them, the 17-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, won the women's 400m \u00adindividual medley by a streak ahead of the two USA swimmers Katie Grimes and Emma Weyant.\n\nGreat Britain's Freya Colbert, who won the world championship earlier this year, was fourth. No one was ever going to catch McIntosh, who was six seconds clear, but Colbert held on to third place all the way up to the final 50m of freestyle, when Weyant pulled ahead of her.\n\nThree other young British swimmers - the breaststroker Angharad Evans, the medley swimmer Katie Shanahan, and the backstroker \u00adOliver Morgan - finished down the field in their own finals: Evans sixth, Shanahan seventh, and \u00adMorgan eighth. Like Richards and Colbert, who is 20, they are all young enough to come again, and Colbert has another chance in the shorter medley later this week.\n\nBut they'll learn, too, sooner rather than later, that chances like the ones that got away from them here in Paris are few and far between in a sport as brutally competitive as this one.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

it has made me hungry for more.\n\n\"An individual Olympic silver medal is massive for me - it's something that I've dreamt of since I was a little boy.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't dreaming of being one step higher on the podium, but tonight it wasn't meant to be.\n\n\"There's lots of lessons I can learn from the racing - I loved every minute of that tonight and it was a proper dogfight.\n\n\"It was a real battle that came down to the finish, and tonight I didn't quite get my hand on the wall fast enough.\n\n\"It felt like [I touched the wall first] - I did think I'd done enough, but it's not a sport of subjection and black and white, it's down to numbers.\n\n\"That's down to my finish and technical ability to get the pressure into the wall.\n\n\"If I got my hand on there first and didn't put enough pressure through the board, that's not the board's fault, that's mine.\n\n\"That's something that I've got to work on, go back, learn from, improve on and make sure it doesn't' happen again.\"\n\nRichards, who was crowned world champion over the distance at the age of just 20 in Fukuoka last year, added: \"I'm young, I'm 21 and I'm planning on being in the sport for at least another 10 years yet, so every single one of these little lessons I can learn is hugely, hugely valuable.\"\n\nAs for Scott, whose four medals in Tokyo made him the most decorated British athlete at a single Olympics, he was unable to improve on his 200m freestyle silver from three years ago as he missed out on a medal by just 0.08s.\n\nThe Scottish star, 27, lost out to fellow Brit Tom Dean - who failed to qualify to defend his title at this Games - in Tokyo and delivered a below-par display in a choppy lane five.\n\nScott, who will also race in the 200m individual medley and relays here in Paris, said: \"I'm pretty disappointed as you can probably imagine.\n\n\"Fourth is pretty tough for anyone - but I'm really happy for Matt.\n\n\"Maybe I saw myself as a little of an underdog tonight whereas last time I was a bit more of a favourite.\n\n\"But I've been coming back strong this whole year - I've got to use that as an advantage, but it's a pretty tough one to swallow.\"", "source": {"uri": "bournemouthecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Echo Sport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandru_Adrian_Popovici", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexandru Adrian Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Popovici", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chlorine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogfight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dogfight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dean_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Dean (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fukuoka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fukuoka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/resources/images/18364052/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773581", "eventUri": "eng-9773581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But my week's not done, it's made me hungrier than ever.\n\n\"Myself and Duncan, second and fourth, gutted for him by the way just missing out on the medal, he deserves it more than anyone but that bodes well for our 4x200m. If fuels me on for the rest of this week. If anything, it has added more fire to my belly. I've got a lot more to come this week.\"\n\nThere was agony for Scott, who was just fractions outside a medal in the same race which would have matched Sir Chris Hoy's record of seven Olympic medals for Team GB.\n\nAs well as Hoy's medal record the British team, Scott is also bidding for a first individual Olympic title at the age of 27 and has another shot later in the Games in the 200m individual medley.\n\nAfter finishing fourth last night, he said: \"I don't really know what to say. Fourth is a horrible place to come. Several hundredths of a second away from winning a medal, or even better.\n\n\"I was buzzing going into that and had really good fun in there. Looking back, I maybe should have pushed it on a bit earlier. It was really tight and came down to the finish but I didn't quite have it today.\"\n\nFor Richards, with a newly done tattoo of the Olympic rings on his right hand, his build-up has been in stark contrast to Tokyo where he won as a teenager.\n\nIn the Covid lockdown, his parents bought a pop-up pool for the family garden and he effectively attached a bungee cord to a garage door to enable him to do intensity training when pools were shut down.\n\nHe looks destined to be the superstar of Team GB's swimming set-up in the future and does not lack for confidence, saying he wanted to be, \"one of the greatest or the greatest\".\n\nHe suggested the British team might be cursed by two hundredths of a second having lost by the same fingertip finish to Peaty.\n\n\"I can't be too disappointed with that,\" he said. \"It's my first ever individual medal at an Olympic Games so to walk away from that with a silver medal is fantastic.\n\n\"Obviously, two hundredths off gold is excruciatingly frustrating. It felt as if I had touched the wall first. I thought I'd got it but you know it wasn't my best finish. I'd be lying if I said it was fantastic. It didn't feel bad. It did feel like I'd done enough but the time says differently.\n\n\"But it's not a sport where it's up for debate. It is black and white so we'll move on, we'll go better and see what we can do next time.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Richards_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Richards (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dean_(swimmer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Dean (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Popovici", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Popovici"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Guy_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Guy (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Peaty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Peaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hoy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_symbols", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic symbols"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/c6ce22e64e70dbb0dfe750f4b44599a3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773581", "eventUri": "eng-9773581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

won the gold medal in no small part down to Scott's terrific anchor leg.\n\nGreat Britain were the fastest qualifiers and went in lane four, with the USA in lane five and the home favourites, France, in\n\nGuy led the team off with Dean next up, who managed to hand over to Richards in the lead - just.\n\nHe gave Scott a lead of half a body length and the Scot was supreme to lead the team home to victory.\n\nScott came away from Tokyo 2020 as Britain's most decorated swimmer at a single Olympics, winning six medals in total.\n\nThat added to the two relay medals he won at his debut Games in Rio de Janeiro back in 2016.\n\nHis medal in this race brings him equal with cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy on seven Olympic medals.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

He won two silvers in Rio.\n\nIt was a dream come true for Richards who thought he had won gold on Monday when he appeared to touch the end of the pool first - and so did fans.\n\nHis name flashed up as the victor in the 200m freestyle, but a Romanian pipped him for the gold medal by the narrowest of margins, and he told afterwards how he didn't press the wall pad hard enough to register the touch.\n\nThe scoreboard was then amended to show he was two hundredths of second slower than David Popovici.

Lukas M\u00e4rtens kicked things off with the 400 freestyle win on night one and the Europeans have just kept rolling every day since, winning the five individual men's events that have been contested in Paris.\n\nMen's Individual Event Winners Thru Day 3\n\nThe only men's event not won by a European is the men's 4\u00d7100 freestyle relay, which the United States dominated for gold. The men can keep their streak alive tomorrow in the 800 freestyle. There, Ireland's Daniel Wiffen, the reigning world champion, looks to win his first Olympic medal. Wiffen is the fastest qualifier through the heats (7:41.53) and will face tough competition from Bobby Finke as well as four other Europeans (Gregorio Paltrinieri, Sven Schwarz, Luca de Tullio, and David Aubry). There's also the men's 4\u00d7200 freestyle relay, where the Brits are the favorites.\n\nDavid Popovici got the European Olympic history ball rolling in the first men's final of the night. The 19-year-old lived up to all the hype that's followed him for the last three years and became an Olympic champion in the men's 200 freestyle relay. His win marks the first time that a Romanian man has won gold in the pool at the Olympic Games. He's the first Romanian to earn a medal of any color since 2004 when Camelia Potec won gold in the women's 200 freestyle and Razvan Florea grabbed bronze in the men's 200 backstroke.\n\nThe third-fastest performer in the history of this event, Popovici did not lead until the end of the race. He was second at the final turn, .37 seconds behind 400 free champion Lukas M\u00e4rtens. Popovici used his long arms to his advantage at the finish, getting the better of Matt Richards, Luke Hobson, and Duncan Scott as all four charged over a chaotic final 50 meters. All four logged a 26.7 on the final lap, with Popovici's field-best 26.74 making the difference for him as he out-touched Richards by .02 seconds.\n\nIt's a huge return to form on the international stage for the Romanian. He's been faster in this event this season, but as this Olympics is currently proving, it's not about the time but the race. At the 2023 World Championships, Popovici led through the entire race but faded to 4th and didn't make the podium following his 2022 win. Today, he showed that was just a blip as he went head-to-head with the other best closers in the world and came out on top.\n\nIt's beautiful, it's a dream come true,\" he said after the race. \"I don't know how to describe it. It's so simple, yet so beautiful.\"\n\n\"This is proof that sometimes you can lose, but you can learn from that,\" Thomas Ceccon said after making his first individual Olympic medal gold with a win in the men's 100 backstroke. Ceccon is referring to the 2023 World Championships, where he didn't defend his gold from the 2022 Worlds (when he set the current world record) and took silver behind Ryan Murphy after being \"a bit slow and [making] a few mistakes, even during warmups.\"\n\nBut as Ceccon also said, he didn't make those same mistakes this time. As a result, he earned Italy's first medal in the men's 100 backstroke. He rocketed to a 52.00 for the win ahead of Xu Jiayu and Murphy, which is the third-fastest swim of his career.\n\nIt's Ceccon's fourth Olympic medal as he's earned one silver and two bronzes swimming on the Italian relays. His win gives a huge boost to the Italian men's medley relay for the end of the meet. Now, the first half of their relay are the newly minted Olympic champions since Nicolo Martinenghi won gold in the 100 breaststroke yesterday. Ceccon and Martinenghi also won their respective 100s of stroke at the 2022 World Championships, where they closed out the meet by defeating the U.S. in the medley relay.\n\nMona McSharry became Ireland's first Olympic medalist since 1996 by taking bronze in the women's 100 breaststroke. McSharry was the second-fastest qualifier for the final after breaking her Irish record of 1:05.51 during the semifinals. She just missed that mark in the final, turning in a 1:05.59 to win her first Olympic medal.\n\n\"Those moments when I thought I was done really put into perspective what I really do this for,\" McSharry said after her race. \"This is a huge bonus but there are so many other things that come as a part of this, like training and watching my friends compete, and being able to see myself progress and get better. And then you have a bonus like this when you get to stand up on the podium and watch your flag being raised at the Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old has become a consistent presence in the senior international women's 100 breaststroke field. She made the Olympic final in Tokyo and has finished 5th at the past two World Championships. She trains at the University of Tennessee and won bronze in the 100 breaststroke at the 2021 SCM World Championships. While she's made plenty of senior international finals before, this is her first senior international long-course medal.", "source": {"uri": "swimswam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SwimSwam"},

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nWales' Matt Richards goes for gold this evening in the Men's 200m freestyle final in Paris.\n\nRichards won gold at the last Olympics in Tokyo as part of the men's 4x200m relay team when he was just 18 years old. He took home the gold in the same event at the 2023 World Championships too.\n\nRichards was born in the West Midlands and currently lives near Bath, with a training base at Millfield School, but is registered as a Welsh swimmer through his Cardiff-born father.\n\nThe 21-year-old has his family in the French capital to support him.\n\nREAD MORE: Adam Peaty tests positive for Covid hours after medal in Olympics bombshell\n\nREAD MORE: Olympics commentator releases statement after 'shameful' on-air comments saw him axed\n\n\"Fundamentally, I'm just really excited to race,\" says Richards, who tried rugby and taekwondo before settling on the sport of swimming.\n\n\"That's what drives me and pushes me every day. The outcomes that come with that can be special, incredible moments but the reason why I do what I do is because I love it.\n\n\"I'm just doing what I enjoy and any pressure that comes with that, comes from doing a good job of doing what I love. I have to pinch myself sometimes and The National Lottery funding means I can focus on this all day, every day.\"\n\nHis mum, Amanda, told the BBC that having that close connection with loved ones there will help spur him on.\n\n\"He's over the moon, he's really excited about us being there,\" she said.\n\n\"If he knows that we're in the crowd, I think it just gives him that extra boost.\"\n\nAlso there to cheer him on will be his fiancee, fellow Team GB swimmer Emily Large, 23. A few days after the competition is over, Richards is set to tie the knot with his partner.\n\nThe ceremony is booked in for August 22 - 11 days after the 2024 Olympics come to an end.\n\nEmily, from Newcastle, said earlier this year: \"Matt does eight sessions a week, I do nine.\n\n\"That comes down over the next few weeks as we both compete in the British trials in April. Last year, we visited Reims near Paris and it was gorgeous, a really nice city with great training facilities for the British team.\"\n\nRichards said Olympic stars will be at the Hereford wedding, with his dad Simon, 49, as best man. He added: \"It will be great. There are 100 guests invited, with a cohort of Team GB swimmers and athletes.\n\n\"My priority now is to try and get an individual swim in 100m and 200m freestyle. I am going to try in the 50m freestyle as well. There will be the relays, too. In a perfect world, I would like to be as busy as possible in Paris to win as many medals as possible.\"\n\nDuring lockdown, Richards trained for the Tokyo games in a paddling pool in his parents' garden in Droitwich, Worcestershire, as his local leisure centre was closed. He had a harness on his back, which was attached to the garage. He joked: \"I am not doing that any more. It is too cold.\"\n\nLarge, unfortunately, is not competing in Paris. She updated social media followers in May, saying: \"I'm gutted to have to say I will be cutting my season short this year and not racing, to ensure I am recovered properly ahead of next season and the next Olympic cycle. It's a kick in the teeth but I'll be back.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mathew_davies@walesonline.co.uk", "name":

Monday's events also saw Popovici win gold in the men's 200m freestyle, McIntosh in the women's 400m individual medley, Italian Thomas Ceccon win the men's 100m backstroke, and Tatjana Smith in the women's 100m breaststroke.\n\nSummer McIntosh made history in swimming at a young age. At just 17 years old, she dominated the 400m individual medley. The Canadian won her second Olympic medal, her first gold, after leading the final from the start. By the 200m mark, she was swimming at a world-record pace. She finished with a time of 4:27.71, securing the gold medal, nearly six seconds ahead of Katie Gries (USA), who took silver, and more than seven seconds ahead of Emma Wayant (USA).\n\nMcIntosh set the world record for the distance last May with a time of 4:24.38 and came to Paris as the favourite. No one could match her. She enjoyed the moments with the fans before stepping onto the podium. At 17, her future looks incredibly bright. The Olympic record held by Hungary's Katinka Hosszu at 4:26.36 was just shy of her time, only a second off.\n\nDavid Popovici won the spectacular men's 200m freestyle final with a time of 1:44.72, one of the most exciting events so far at the D\u00e9fense Arena, a race with a rich history featuring champions like Thorpe, Phelps, and Michael Gross. Popovici had to work hard for his victory, making an Olympic comeback to touch the wall before his rivals, Mateo Richards of the United Kingdom and Lucas Hobson of the United States, who was the surprise of the final.\n\nPopovici had to exert maximum effort, even achieving a slower time than in the semifinals. Interestingly, Popovici swam four-hundredths of a second slower than he did in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, where he finished fourth. Here in Paris, that time was enough for him to become the Olympic champion.\n\nFour swimmers finished within just 15 hundredths of a second of each other, demonstrating how closely contested the race was. It was a slower final than in Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, but it earned Popovici the Olympic title at 19 years old. Just three-hundredths of a second separated the three medalists. In the last length, the three swimmers exchanged positions, and any of them could have won.\n\nPopovici had shown vulnerability only at the World Championships; he had always won his other races with total dominance, but this Olympic final pushed him to his limits.\n\nThe men's 100m backstroke final also showcased a high level of competition. Thomas Ceccon of Italy won gold after a spectacular finish. He struggled in the first length but made an impossible comeback in the final stretch, being the only swimmer to go under 27 seconds in the last length. He beat Jiayu Su of China and USA's Ryan Murphy, who took silver and bronze, respectively. Ceccon stopped the clock at 52.00, his best time of the year. Silver swam in 52.32 and bronze in 52.39.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's 100m breaststroke. Tatjana Smith won gold with a time of 1:05.28 in the last stroke the women's 100m breaststroke. She had to dig deep in the final meters as the medal was slipping away. Smith lived up to expectations, and the world record holder and world champion also achieved Olympic glory. Silver went to Tang Qianting (CHI), just 25 hundredths behind, and bronze to Mona McSharry, who was five hundredths off the silver.\n\nThe last final of Monday was the women's 200m freestyle. Mollie O'Callaghan had the best start, setting a new Olympic record with a time of 1:53.27. Titmus Arianne (Australia) with 1:53.81 and Bernardette Haughey (HKG) with 1:54.55, took silver and bronze, respectively. O'Callaghan had a great start, but Hareestyle. Mollie O'Callaghan had the best start, setting a new Olympic record with a time of 1:53.27. Titmus Arianne (Australia) with 1:5ughey, who always turns better, took the lead.\n\nThey were on a world record pace in the early stages. O'Callaghan lost some ground and switched to a tactical race. Haughey held the lead, but O'Callaghan pushed hard in the final length to win the gold and set a new Olympic record, taking it from her fellow Australian, Titmus.\n\nLater on Monday night, the semi-finals of the women's 100m backstroke took place as expected. World record holder Regan Smith won the first semi-final with a time of 57.13. The American swimmer set the world record recently at the US Trials, and her form in Paris is outstanding.\n\nShe finished the race looking like she had saved some energy for the final. The other semi-final was won by Kylee McKeown. She swam slightly slower than Smith in the previous semi-final. Both will be the favourites for the final, as they are the brightest swimmers in the distance currently.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Welshman was just 18 when he won gold at the last Olympics in Tokyo as part of the men's 4x200m relay team.\n\nNow 21, he's aiming for his first individual Olympic gold medal. And with him competing in two solo and three relays, hopes are high that he could well return home with multiple medals.\n\nHe's said: \"There is a hell of a lot of medal potential in Paris. Five would be the most that any Brit has ever won and that has got to be the target.\"\n\nREAD MORE: What is in the box given to Paris Olympic medal winners?\n\nCheering him on in Paris will be Matt's fiancee, fellow swimmer Emily Large, 23. The couple are due to tie the knot in Hereford just a few days after the competition is over, with a cohort of Team GB swimmers and athletes among the guest list.\n\nRead on to find out all about his life and career.\n\nEarly life, school and love of swimming\n\nMatt was born in the West Midlands on December 17, 2002 and currently lives near Bath, with a training base at Millfield School. Although born in England, he is registered as a Welsh swimmer through his Cardiff-born father.\n\nAnd his heart is in Wales, with him previously saying: \"I see myself as Welsh. In general, I am absolutely a proud Welshman regardless of the fact I was born in England.\"\n\nHis passion for the water became clear when he was just five, on a family holiday to Tenerife with parents Simon and Amanda. He told Dai Sport that he was unhappy with having to wear armbands in the pool while older children didn't - promptly putting them to one side and throwing himself into the deep end.\n\nHe said: \"My parents both had a heart attack, my dad ran in and jumped in after me but I was fine and I loved it and that was where I found I had a real love for the water.\"\n\nHe was ten when he joined Worcester Swimming Club, where he was coached by Mark Stowe. His former coach recently told the PA news agency Matt was a \"cheeky little chap who was quite mischievous\" but recalled him having \"plenty of potential\".\n\nMatt then moved to the Royal School, Wolverhampton, going on to train under Jol Finck at the Bath National Centre. He was a European Junior champion in the men's 100m freestyle in 2019 and made his senior international debut for Britain at the European Championships in Budapest.\n\nAfter moving to train under coach Ryan Livingstone at Millfield School in 2023 he enjoyed a hugely successful year, being crowned world champion in the 200m freestyle in Fukuoka.\n\nTraining in a paddling pool\n\nDuring lockdown, the swimmer trained for the Tokyo games in a paddling pool in his parents' garden in Droitwich, Worcestershire while his local leisure centre was closed. He had a harness on his back attached to the garage while he trained in the tiny 1.5m deep and 5m long pool.\n\nHis mum Amanda told ITV that the family all tried to pitch in with his efforts, saying: \"He found it quite difficult when he was doing it on his own, so we offered to go and help out and stand out and time (him), as I was working from home at the time.\n\n\"We were having to time on these sets. And then we used the washing line pole to tap him on the head or back when he needed to change what he was doing.\n\n\"Finn (the family's dog) didn't know what was going on, and every time Matt got into the pool and started training he would run around the pool at 100mph because he thought Matt was drowning.\"\n\nMatt now jokes: \"I am not doing that any more. It is too cold.\"\n\nTattoo and life outside swimming\n\nMatt is a talented sportsman in and out of the pool, trying rugby and taekwondo before settling on swimming. His official Team GB profile notes that he has a \"soft spot for fast cars and designer watches\". He also invests on the stock market.\n\nHe has a tattoo of the back of his right hand of the Olympic rings, which was commissioned after competing in his debut Games at Tokyo and his gold medal in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay.\n\nOlympic couple goals\n\nUnfortunately Matt's wife-to-be Emily, a butterfly specialist, is not competing in Paris for the second Olympic Games in succession. Her season was brought to a halt after a diagnosis of glandular fever.\n\nShe told followers on social media in May: \"I'm gutted to have to say I will be cutting my season short this year and not racing, to ensure I am recovered properly ahead of next season and the next Olympic cycle. It's a kick in the teeth but I'll be back.\"\n\nAfter she missed out on selection for Tokyo, Matt said it was a \"tough situation to be in as a couple and it scarred both of us. But it only drives us on more\". He said they both wanted to \"see what we can do on the world stage together\".\n\nThe sports stars are now hoping it will be third time lucky at the next Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028 - this time as husband and wife.\n\n\"I'm just excited to race\"\n\nAt the Paris Olympics Matt will be involved in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, both individual and relay, plus the 4x100m medley relay. If he is on the podium in all five events, he will become the most decorated British athlete at a single Games, which would see him eclipse friend and rival Duncan Scott, who won four medals in Tokyo.\n\nHe told Wales Online: \"Fundamentally, I'm just really excited to race. That's what drives me and pushes me every day. The outcomes that come with that can be special, incredible moments but the reason why I do what I do is because I love it.\n\n\"I'm just doing what I enjoy and any pressure that comes with that, comes from doing a good job of doing what I love. I have to pinch myself sometimes and National Lottery funding means I can focus on this all day, every day.\"\n\nThe men's 200m freestyle final takes place at 7.40pm on Monday night, and will be live on BBC One.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorna_hughes@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Lorna

More info\n\nClare Balding c all a brief pause to Olympics on Monday night, to reveal that a Team GB athlete, who had just cliched a silver medal, had been rocked by the news that his family had fallen victim to ticket scammers.\n\nWhile it was his swimming teammate Duncan Scott who seemed to be likely British chance of a medal in the 200m individual medley, it was in fact Matt Richards who ended up on the podium, after an extremely close race. Richards was just two hundredths of a second away from winning gold, being beaten by the closest margin by Romania's David Popovic.\n\nScott ended up in fourth, but even he was just a whisker away from taking gold as well; as he and Richards now turn their attention to trying to maintain Team GB's Olympic title in the 200m IM relay.\n\nREAD MORE: Gabby Logan wades in on BBC Olympics row as Clare Balding under fire\n\nGet all the latest TV and showbiz news and gossip from Chronicle Live with our free newsletter\n\nGiving their verdict closely fought final back in the BBC studio, Clare and ex Olympians Rebecca Adlington and Mark Foster were absolutely thrilled for Richards, as well as being in shock had just how tight the finish was. And it was then that Clare changed the subject to reveal that, rather than being given free tickets for the event, the young swimmer's family had to buy their own and ended up facing the very real possibility of not even being in the crowd, when they fell victim to a ticket scam.\n\nClare went onto explain that, thanks to her BBC colleague Jeanette Kwakye getting money saving expert Martin Lewis on the case, Richards' family were eventually able to get a refund, before then managing to get their hands on some legitimate tickets at the last minute, meaning they were there to see their boy win silver.\n\nThe conversation about the ticket scam led to two time gold medallist Adlington to question why swimmers' didn't get a few free tickets so their family were guaranteed a place in the crowd to watch them, before both she, Clare and Mark hit out at some of the eye watering ticket prices for the Games in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_duke@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Simon Duke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Balding", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clare Balding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Scott_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duncan Scott (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Logan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Logan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evening Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanette_Kwakye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeanette Kwakye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lewis (financial journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Foster_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Foster (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Adlington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Adlington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29638180.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_image3-2jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773581", "eventUri": "eng-9773581", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

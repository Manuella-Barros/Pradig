Four rounds will decide who wins the claret jug - the oldest trophy in golf - this year.\n\nBut only the top 70 players and ties will make the cut on Friday. It's a larger field than in the U.S. Open (top 60 players and ties) and the Masters (top 50).\n\nThe last few years have seen a low cut line at the British Open. It was 3-over in 2023, par in 2022, and 1-over in 2021. That's lower than the last British Open at Royal Troon in 2016 that saw a cut line of 4-over.\n\nAfter the first round on Thursday, 81 players were at 3 over or better for the projected cut line. That projection's moved around multiple times in round two at Royal Troon.\n\nThe second round is still going but the cut line started at -3 to kick off round 2.\n\nTiger Woods ended play on Thursday at 8 over and will need a magical round to see the weekend.\n\nThere are still many players left to finish the second round today but a few notable players are in trouble of missing the cut to start play Friday.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

High winds are wreaking havoc on the field and scores are ballooning on cut day.\n\nShane Lowry currently holds the lead at seven under (thanks in part to playing on the correct side of the draw), but most of the field is not having the same success as the Irishman. As of this writing, just 10 players are in red figures for the tournament -- and that number is sure to shrink as the day progresses.\n\nHere's who's in danger of missing the cut at Royal Troon.\n\nA total of 157 players teed off at this year's Open Championship, but roughly half of them won't be around to play the weekend. At the conclusion of the second round, the top 70 players plus ties will make the cut. The remainder of the field will be headed home early. The cut-line rules at the Open Championship are the same as the PGA Championship, and slightly more lenient than those at the U.S. Open (top 60 and ties) and the Masters (top 50 and ties).\n\nAs of 12:40 p.m. ET, the cut line sits at five over, with 75 players inside that number. However, with much of the afternoon wave still on the course, that number will likely be higher by day's end. According to Data Golf, the cut line will likely slide to six over by the conclusion of play.\n\nThe Open Championship will be without plenty of big names this weekend. Tiger Woods will miss the cut at the Open for the fifth time in his career after rounds of 79 and 77 leave him at 14 over through two rounds. Cameron Smith, the 2022 Open champion, will also miss the weekend as he posted 12 over for two rounds. Others in danger of missing the cut include Rory McIlroy, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Bryson DeChambeau and Tommy Fleetwood.

Two more days at the British Open. And while he was still 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something goes his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was among those in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, and the Californian looked to be on the verge to taking another big step in his career. He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way - a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\nMax Homa of the United States reacts after sinking a birdie putt on the 18th green during his second round of the British Open Golf Championships at Royal Troon golf club in Troon, Scotland, Friday, July 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Scott Heppell)\n\n\"Maybe I\u00b4m just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don\u00b4t know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn\u00b4t really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut - Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nAs for the three-putt?\n\n\"I was a little bit out of focus,\" he said.\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men\u00b4s competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nFor all the attention on players who missed the cut, Rickie Fowler should not be overlooked. He birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 to make the cut on the number. ... Hideki Matsuyama is among 13 players who made the cut in all four majors. Xander Schauffele, the PGA champion, is tied for seventh. He has finished in the top 10 at all four majors this year. ... John Daly (swollen knee) and Ernie Els withdrew before the second round started. ... Four amateurs made the cut, led by Calum Scott of Scotland at 4-over 146. He plays at Texas Tech.\n\nAP Sports Writer Ken Maguire contributed to this report.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nBryson DeChambeau of the United States gestures to the crowd on the 18th green during his second round of the British Open Golf Championships at Royal Troon golf club in Troon, Scotland, Friday, July 19, 2024.

Two more days at the British Open. And while he was still 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something goes his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was among those in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, and the Californian looked to be on the verge to taking another big step in his career. He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way -- a double-bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple-bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nIII\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut -- Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nIII\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nAs for the three-putt?\n\n\"I was a little bit out of focus,\" he said.\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nIII\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nIII\n\nFor all the attention on players who missed the cut, Rickie Fowler should not be overlooked. He birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 to make the cut on the number. ... Hideki Matsuyama is among 13 players who made the cut in all four majors. Xander Schauffele, the PGA champion, is tied for seventh. He has finished in the top 10 at all four majors this year. ... John Daly (swollen knee) and Ernie Els withdrew before the second round started. ... Four amateurs made the cut, led by Calum Scott of Scotland at 4-over 146. He plays at Texas Tech.", "source": {"uri": "newstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jefferson City News Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf",

The cut was 4-over in 2016, 3-over in 2004, and 5-over in 1997. The last five British Open championships have averaged a cut between 1- and 2-over.\n\nThat wasn't the case this year.

Most notably is World No. 2 Rory McIlroy, the 2014 British Open winner, who ended Round 2 at 11-over.

Cox/Getty Images\n\nNeither of the protagonists from the thrilling Sunday at last month's U.S. Open will be playing the weekend at the 152nd British Open.\n\nAfter an opening-round 78 at Royal Troon, Rory McIlroy saw any chances at a Friday rally vanish early with a bogey-triple bogey-bogey-double bogey stretch from the 3rd through 6th holes. A holeout from a pot bunker at the par-3 14th was a highlight but too little, too late as he finished at 11 over after rounds of 78-75.\n\nThe cut line fell at 6-over 148, with 80 players making the weekend at Royal Troon.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who beat McIlroy by a shot at Pinehurst, also missed the cut after rounds of 76-75 -- 151.\n\nTiger Woods missed his third straight major cut this season after rounds of 79-77 and said he won't play again until December.\n\nHenrik Stenson, the winner at Royal Troon in 2016 in memorable duel with Phil Mickelson, missed the cut at 8 over. But Mickelson will continue, as the 2013 Open champ made the cut at 5 over.\n\nKeegan Bradley, who has had a busy couple weeks since being named the 2025 U.S. Ryder Cup captain, missed the cut by one shot at 7 over after shooting 75. Zach Johnson, his predecessor as captain and the 2015 Open champion, missed the cut at 9 over.\n\nTony Finau and Viktor Hovland, two players often named as the game's best without a major title, went home after shooting 10 over. Ludvig Aberg, the rising Swedish star, missed the cut at 9 over.\n\nAmong the happier stories are Justin Thomas and Robert MacIntyre, who have Saturday tee times after both appeared to be going home midway through their Friday rounds. Thomas shot a ghastly 45 on his first nine but made three birdies coming in to salvage a round of 78 to get him through at 4 over.\n\nMacIntyre, the winner last week on home turf at the Genesis Scottish Open, made the cut at 5 over despite playing his first four holes in 10 over Friday with two bogeys and two triples. But those would be his last squares on the scorecard as he made four birdies the rest of the round and shot 75.\n\n\"After four holes, I was staring 90 in the face if that wind had stayed up and it actually did stay the same,\" MacIntyre said. \"It was just I've got a lot of pride in myself.\"\n\nMax Homa birdied two of his last three holes to shoot 72 make the cut on the number, including the par-4 18th where he let out a roar.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself. This is my favorite tournament in the world,\" Homa said. \"So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament. It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_schwarb@si.com", "name": "John Schwarb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Stenson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henrik Stenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1289,h_725,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si/01j36a5jdpja2v37svcd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748141", "eventUri": "eng-9748141", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Just was fighting it pretty much all day. I never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently made a lot of bogeys.\"\n\nOther former champions who missed the cut were Australian Cameron Smith, the 2022 winner at St Andrews, Italy's Francesco Molinari, Swede Henrik Stenson, who won the previous Open at Troon in 2016, Americans Zach Johnson, Stewart Cink, Justin Leonard and Todd Hamilton, and South African Louis Oosthuizen.\n\nAlso missing out after withdrawing from the tournament before the second round were twice winner Ernie Els of South Africa and American John Daly, the 1995 champion at St Andrews.\n\nOther big names who failed to make the cut were Sweden's world number four Ludvig Aberg, ninth-ranked American Bryson DeChambeau, the U.S. Open champion, and Norway's world number seven Viktor Hovland.\n\nSeven players ranked in the world's top 12 made an early exit from Royal Troon.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [],

Two more days at the British Open. And while he was still 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something goes his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was among those in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, and the Californian looked to be on the verge to taking another big step in his career. He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way -- a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nGoing home early\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut -- Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nAnatomy of an 8 on No. 8\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nAs for the three-putt?\n\n\"I was a little bit out of focus,\" he said.\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nOlympics on tap\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nDivots\n\nFor all the attention on players who missed the cut, Rickie Fowler should not be overlooked. He birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 to make the cut on the number. ... Hideki Matsuyama is among 13 players who made the cut in all four majors. Xander Schauffele, the PGA champion, is tied for seventh. He has finished in the top 10 at all four majors this year. ... John Daly (swollen knee) and Ernie Els withdrew before the second round started. ... Four amateurs made the cut, led by Calum Scott of Scotland at 4-over 146. He plays at Texas Tech.\n\nAP Sports Writer Ken Maguire contributed to this report.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Woods shots a 77, for a two-day total of 14-over 156. Scott Heppell/Associated Press\n\nTROON, Scotland -- Tiger Woods tied a personal record in the British Open on Friday, one he could have done without but perhaps should come to expect.\n\nWoods matched his highest 36-hole score as a professional - 156 - to miss the cut for the third straight time in a major.\n\nHe tapped in for a routine par on the 18th hole at Royal Troon and signed for a 6-over 77, a round that got away from him early with a double bogey and never improved.\n\n\"It wasn't very good,\" Woods said. \"I made a double right out of the hopper when I needed to go the other way. Just was fighting it pretty much all day. I never really hit it close enough to make birdies, and consequently made a lot of bogeys.\"\n\nThat brought a short season to an abrupt end.\n\nWoods said he won't play again until December, possibly at his Hero World Challenge with a 20-man field in the Bahamas. He specifically referenced what he jokingly calls his fifth major, the PNC Championship, a 36-hole exhibition where he plays alongside his 15-year-old son, Charlie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played all four majors for the first time since 2019 - the year he won the Masters for his 15th career major - but played only one other tournament, withdrawing after 24 holes from the Genesis Invitational in February because of the flu.\n\nHe needs to play more to get sharp. But playing more risks taking a toll on a body that has been battered by back surgeries, knee surgeries and a February 2021 car crash that shattered his right leg and ankle.\n\nIt's the ultimate Catch-22 for a player who turns 49 at the end of the year.\n\n\"I'd like to have played more, but I just wanted to make sure that I was able to play the major championships this year,\" he said. \"I got a lot of time off to get better, to be better physically, which has been the case all year.\n\n\"Physically I've gotten better, which is great. I just need to keep progressing like that, and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again.\"\n\nHe has never liked the idea of being a ceremonial golfer, but that's what the scores suggest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his 10 rounds at the majors this year, his average score was 75.6. He shot over par in all but one round - an even-par 72 in the first round at the Masters - and has gone 15 consecutive rounds in the majors since he last broke par.\n\nWoods also had a 156 when he missed the cut in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay, where he was trying to return from the first of what would be five back surgeries. His only 36-hole score higher in a PGA Tour event was a 157 at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a high school senior.\n\nHOMA REGROUPS: Max Homa watched the 30-foot birdie putt drop into the cup and let out a huge roar, his biggest celebration since his strong Ryder Cup debut last year in Italy.\n\nThe reason for his celebration? Two more days at the British Open. And while he was 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something go his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, but has had only one top 10 since then. In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today, for one of the first times maybe ever, I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way - a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, and a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nGOING HOME EARLY: It's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There were plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut - Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nOLYMPICS ON TAP: Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze medal that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend

They struggled with challenging weather conditions and high winds. McIlroy's bid to end a decade-long wait for a major fell short, while Woods missed the cut by a wide margin.\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy and three-times winner Tiger Woods led a long list of former champions who missed the British Open cut after a windswept second round at Royal Troon on Friday.\n\nMcIlroy, who lifted the Claret Jug in 2014 at Hoylake, made a premature exit from the year's final major after struggling to an opening 78 and following up with a 75. The cut fell at six-over 142 with 80 players advancing to Saturday's third round.\n\nA missed birdie putt from five feet at the last summed up a disappointing week for McIlroy, who had been bidding to end a decade-long wait for his fifth major title after his late meltdown cost him the chance to win last month's U.S. Open. \"I got off to the worst start possible today, being six-over through six, but then played the last 12 holes pretty well, bogey-free,\" the Northern Irishman told reporters.\n\n\"If I need to remember something about this week, it'll be the last few holes that I played. I didn't adapt well at all to that left-to-right wind yesterday on the back nine, and then this afternoon going out in that gusty wind on the front, it got the better of me,\" added the Northern Irishman, who bogeyed the third, ran up a triple at the fourth and dropped shots at the fifth and sixth.\n\nWoods, who competed in all four majors this year for the first time since 2019 after struggling with his health in recent years, missed the cut by a wide margin after scores of 79 and 77. \"Well, it wasn't very good,\" the 48-year-old American said of his second round. \"I made a double (bogey) there at two right out of the hopper when I needed to go the other way. Just was fighting it pretty much all day.

After the eight on four, I resigned myself to the fact I wouldn't be here for the weekend,' the 35-year-old told Sky Sports.\n\n'That four-hole stretch at the start of the round was unfortunate in the worst of the wind. The wind died down on the back nine and it became more manageable for me.\n\n'Over the course of the two days, I guess the conditions got the better of me. That was the story of the week.\n\n'I think I have to remind myself that I am close and keep giving myself chances. These disappointing Sundays are racking up, but I'd much rather have disappointing Sundays than be going home on a Friday night.\n\n'I've got to keep doing what I'm doing, reflect on the windy conditions getting the better of me at two of the majors this year.

He [Lowry] relishes these conditions,' he added.\n\n'He gets more up for this than anything else.

He has now missed the cut in back-to-back starts and withdrew with a back injury at the Rocket Mortgage Classic. He finished T-9 in the Masters but missed the cut in his final two majors in his return this season from back surgery.\n\nTommy Fleetwood\n\nTommy Fleetwood plays a shot from the rough on the 15th hole as his caddie Ian Finnis looks on during day two of The 152nd Open championship at Royal Troon on July 19, 2024 in Troon, Scotland.

He blamed his equipment but the reality is he didn't hit enough fairways and missed some short putts early. He still hasn't shown that his game translates to links golf, high wind and playing in inclement weather. But it was a tremendous major season for DeChambeau who held the 36-hole lead at the Masters before finishing T-6, finished second at the PGA Championship and became a two-time U.S. Open winner in dramatic fashion at Pinehurst.\n\nLudvig Aberg\n\nLudvig Aberg reacts on the 18th green during day two of The 152nd Open championship at Royal Troon.

He made a triple-bogey 7 at No. 9 and a quadruple-bogey 8 at No. 12 en route to shooting 81.\n\nFinau had made the cut at the first three majors, including an impressive T-3 result at the U.S. Open.\n\nTom Kim\n\nTom Kim plays from a green-side bunker on the eighth hole during his second round, on day two of the 152nd British Open Golf Championship at Royal Troon on the south west coast of Scotland on July 19, 2024.

Well, it went even worse on Friday as he failed to make a single birdie and shot 77. He missed just his fourth cut in 18 appearances this season but his second in his last three starts. It was an uneventful major campaign - a pair of T-26s and a T-30 to go along with the MC here.\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nRory McIlroy reacts as he walks off the 18th green during day two of The 152nd Open championship at Royal Troon on July 19, 2024 in Troon, Scotland. (Photo by Warren Little/Getty Images)\n\nMcIlroy ended his latest major championship with a dud. After his U.S. Open heartbreak in June, he had one more chance to grab a major and went 78-75. He was 6-over through six holes on Friday, making an 8 on the fourth hole that sealed his fate.\n\n\"That was it, 22 holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week,\" he said.\n\nMcIlroy has now gone 10 years and 40 majors without a major championship victory and he'll have to wait until April and the Masters for his next chance.\n\n\"When I look back on the two majors that I didn't play my best at, here and the Masters, the wind got the better of me on Friday at Augusta, and then the wind got the better of me the last two days here,\" he said. \"I didn't adapt well at all to that left-to-right wind yesterday on the back nine, and then this afternoon going out in that gusty wind on the front, as I said, it got the better of me, and I felt pretty uncomfortable over a few shots.\"\n\nCam Smith\n\nCameron Smith putts on the eighth green during his second round on day two of the 152nd British Open at Royal Troon. (Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe 2022 British Open champ shot himself out of this year's championship on Thursday. He posted 9-over 80, the worse round of his career at the British Open.\n\n\"If you had have told me (Wednesday) that I was going to shoot that, I wouldn't have said that was possible,\" Smith said.\n\nThe Aussie followed with a 74 on Friday. He had made eight straight cut in majors. He finished T-6 at the Masters but was a non-factor at the PGA Championship (T-63) and U.S. Open (T-32)\n\nSahith Theegala\n\nSahith Theegala plays his second shot on the 11th hole during day two of The 152nd Open championship at Royal Troon.

The second round was even worse: he made a triple-bogey 8 at No. 6 and shot 41 on the front nine and signed for 79. It was just his fourth missed cut in 20 starts this season. Theegala, No. 11 in the world, had made the cut in the first three majors with a best of T-12 at the PGA Championship.\n\nWyndham Clark\n\nWyndham Clark watches his drive from the fourth tee during his second round on day two of the 152nd British Open at Royal Troon.

He also missed the cut at the Masters and the PGA Championship and finished T-56 in his U.S. Open title defense.\n\nClark had a double on the 11th and a triple on the 12th on Thursday and tripled 12 again on Friday.\n\nTiger Woods\n\nTiger Woods alks on the 18th fairway during day two of The 152nd Open championship at Royal Troon. (Kevin C.

Tiger made the cut for a Masters record 24th consecutive time, but finished 60th and then missed the cut at the other three majors.\n\n\"I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the

For most links golf courses, including many in the Open rota, wind and pot bunkers are the greatest defense. The R&A knew wind was coming this week, so far it has, and it's been spectacular. The result has been a Royal Troon setup that has been challenging and diabolical while also remaining a very fair test for the game's best. Troon has wrought particular havoc on those who have been on the wrong side of the draw (Thursday morning/Friday afternoon). Justin Thomas, for example, shot 45 in his opening nine on Friday (but still managed to shoot 78).\n\nAs for the pot bunkers? They haven't been easy either. Joaquin Niemann made an 8 on the itty-bitty par-3 8th Postage Stamp hole on Friday, needing four shots to get out of the greenside bunkers. Tom Kim also visited three of the five bunkers on that hole alone, making a double-bogey 5. (\"As you know, links golf is very simple,\" Slumbers quipped on Wednesday, \"stay out of the bunkers.\")\n\nNiemann, quite incredibly, rebounded to make four birdies in his next seven holes to shoot even par for the second straight day and stay a manageable seven shots off Shane Lowry's lead. But Kim, the 17th-ranked player in the world, missed the cut. He wasn't alone. A handful of some of the biggest names in golf are leaving Royal Troon and the final major of the year early, as the Open Championship cut line moved to six over on Friday afternoon.\n\nGone is Tiger Woods, who followed his opening-round 79 with a 77 on Friday. He finished 14 over for his third straight missed cut in a major. He said on Thursday he's gotten better as the year has progressed but wishes he could play more in general. Although with his body, his strategy is instead to save his energy for the big ones.\n\n\"I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,\" Woods said Friday. \"Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn't as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did.\"\n\nPerhaps the most surprising missed cut came from Rory McIlroy, who shot 78-75 (11 over), his 153 the second-highest 36-hole total he's recorded in his major career. He entered the week as one of the betting favorites, with many thinking he was a likely candidate to bounce back after a heartbreaking U.S. Open loss last month.\n\n\"I think once I made the 8 on the 4th hole, that was it. Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week,\" McIlroy said with a defeated smirk. \"That was basically it. I mean, I knew from then I'd sort of resigned myself to the fact that I wasn't going to shoot, whatever it is, four or five under from there on in to make the cut.\"\n\nNewly named Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley and Will Zalatoris both finished seven over and missed the cut by a shot. Henrik Stenson, the runaway winner here in 2016, finished eight over and missed the cut. Tyrrell Hatton shot 77 on Friday. He was just two over for the week with eight holes remaining in his second round, but he played them in six over to finish eight over.\n\nThree other pre-tournament favorites -- U.S. Open champ Bryson DeChambeau, rising star Ludvig Aberg and Englishman Tommy Fleetwood -- all finished nine under to miss the cut. Tony Finau and Viktor Hovland both shot 10 over and are heading home. Finau, who shot 71 Thursday, was 10 strokes worse on Friday.\n\nThe 2022 Open champ from St. Andrews, Cameron Smith, finished 12 over and missed the cut. World No. 11 Sahith Theegala shot 14 over. Also gone is Wyndham Clark, the 2023 U.S. Open winner, who shot 78-80 for a 16-over week.\n\nAll said, 10 of the top 20 players in the Official World Golf Ranking missed the cut at The Open, which feels worse for this tournament since the wait for the next major, the 2025 Masters, is so long away.\n\nAfter his round, Fleetwood was asked how he'd reflect on his day.\n\n\"Well, it's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keegan_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keegan Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Stenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henrik Stenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/opens-stars-miss-cut.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748141", "eventUri": "eng-9748141", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Two more days at the British Open. And while he was still 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something goes his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was among those in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, and the Californian looked to be on the verge to taking another big step in his career. He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way -- a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nGoing home early\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut -- Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nAnatomy of an 8 on No. 8\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nAs for the three-putt?\n\n\"I was a little bit out of focus,\" he said.\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nOlympics on tap\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nDivots\n\nFor all the attention on players who missed the cut, Rickie Fowler should not be overlooked. He birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 to make the cut on the number. ... Hideki Matsuyama is among 13 players who made the cut in all four majors. Xander Schauffele, the PGA champion, is tied for seventh. He has finished in the top 10 at all four majors this year. ... John Daly (swollen knee) and Ernie Els withdrew before the second round started. ... Four amateurs made the cut, led by Calum Scott of Scotland at 4-over 146. He plays at Texas Tech.\n\nAP Sports Writer Ken Maguire contributed to this report.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

An impressive start to life as a pro with plenty more to come you'd have to think.\n\nTommy Fleetwood cut a devastated figure walking down the 18th hole on Friday evening in the knowledge that he was missing the cut at The Open for the first time since 2015.\n\nThe Englishman has an excellent record in golf's oldest Major, having been 2nd to Shane Lowry in 2019, T4th in 2022 and T10th last year.\n\nHe came into the week high in confidence but ultimately heads home after shooting eight-over-par, having played in the toughest of the conditions at Troon.\n\n\"It was tough. Yeah, look, conditions are tough, the golf course is tough. But it's your job to figure it out and to put in a score, and I just couldn't do that,\" he said.\n\nHovland surprisingly finished 3rd at the PGA Championship after returning to swing coach Joe Mayo - who he split with at the end of last year - but he's gone on to miss the cut in all three of the other men's Majors.\n\nFor a player who won the FedEx Cup last year and starred in Europe's Ryder Cup victory, it has to go down as a very disappointing Major season.\n\nThe Norwegian managed just one birdie over two days at Troon this week.\n\nMcIlroy admitted he was just hoping to make the cut after an opening 78 (his highest score since 2021) and his hopes had vanished after just four holes of round two.\n\nThe Northern Irishman dropped a shot at the 3rd before coming undone at the 7th, where he made a triple bogey 8 after topping a shot in the thick rough and then chipping it across the green into a bunker.\n\nThe World No.2 fought valiantly on the back nine, though, which he played flawlessly with two birdies and seven pars.\n\nHis US Open agony may hurt even more now as the realization hits it that it's another Majorless year with nine months to go until Augusta.\n\nIt's his first missed cut in The Open since Royal Portrush, 2019.\n\nThe damage was done on Thursday for Cameron Smith, who slumped to a surprising 80 after opening with a bogey and a triple to turn in seven-over.\n\nThe Australian, who won the 150th Open at St Andrews two years ago, comfortably finished short of the +7 mark to miss his first Major cut in over two years.\n\nWoods misses his third consecutive Major cut, and by some margin, after a disappointing two days at Royal Troon.\n\nThe 15-time Major winner, who has won three Claret Jugs, started strongly on Thursday with two pars and a birdie but it immediately started to go downhill.\n\nWe'll next see him at the Hero World Challenge in December, the small-field event he hosts in The Bahamas.\n\n\"I'd like to have played more, but I just wanted to make sure that I was able to play the Major championships this year,\" he said.\n\n\"I got a lot of time off to get better, to be better physically, which has been the case all year. I've gotten better, even though my results really haven't shown it, but physically I've gotten better, which is great.\n\n'I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again.\"\n\nOf the 154 men to complete 36 holes, the 2023 US Open champion beat just seven of them.\n\nClark's disappointing year continues, with his 2024 Major season reading MC-MC-T65-MC.\n\nIt's not form you'd expect from the World No.5, although he does have a miserable Major record aside from his win at LACC last year. From 11 appearances he has one win, six missed cuts and a next-best finish of T33.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It has left players like Tyrrell Hatton to complain about the setup, Max Homa to need a lengthy putt on his final hole just to make the cut, and embarrass countless others. Through 36 holes, there are only 10 golfers under par of the 156 that played the tournament.\n\nThere is still a lot of work to do, which Lowry acknowledged after his hot start. Local legend Justin Rose (Englishman) is tied for second two shots back and current World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler lurks at 2-under. Sure enough, there will be plenty of drama to unfold as the final two days play out.\n\nNevertheless, a number of golf's elite were sent home packing early, missing the cut at the Open Championship.\n\nWyndham Clark: 16-Over\n\nWyndham Clark, the 2023 U.S. Open champion, struggled yet again to close his major season.\n\nWhat began as a great start to his year with a win at Pebble Beach and runner-up finishes to Scheffler has turned sour. Clark missed the cut at the Masters and PGA Championship, finished T56 at the U.S. Open and is leaving Scotland early.\n\nIf his opening round 78 did not discourage him, his second round 80 must have. Clark needs to go back to the drawing board and find his form again before trying to help Team USA in the Olympics.\n\nTiger Woods: 14-Over\n\nNot many expected Tiger Woods to be in contention this week. But there was hope he could at least have a proper showing and quiet all of the retirement talk.\n\nSo much for that.\n\nWoods struggled out of the gate and could never get anything going. Tiger missing the weekend of a major is becoming commonplace outside of Augusta National, sadly.\n\nCameron Smith: 12-Over\n\nAustralian and LIV Golf star Cam Smith is the next player on the list.\n\nDespite playing relatively well Friday, his opening round 9-over 80 doomed him. Knowing the conditions of this track, there wasn't much of a chance coming back from that. Smith is still one of the more talented players in the world, but after a solid Masters showing, he has fallen apart.\n\nRory McIlroy: 11-Over\n\nRory McIlroy entered the Open Championship with hopes of putting his U.S. Open collapse behind him. So much for that. The Northern Irishman was done in by an opening round 78 and could not recover.\n\nHe will have to enter the offseason with questions hanging over his head.\n\nTony Finau: 10-Over\n\nTony Finau put together a fantastic first round. He carded an ever par 71 and had his sights set on winning his first major championship. The Friday happened.\n\nFinau went out in 41 and things got no better on the back nine. His quadruple bogey on the par-4 12th ended any hopes of making the weekend.\n\nViktor Hovland: 10-Over\n\nViktor Hovland's terrible year continued this week at the Open Championship. After winning the 2023 PGA Tour Championship, his game has completely fallen apart.\n\nHovland struggled Thursday and things got no better Friday, finishing four shots below the cut line.\n\nThe Norwegian star has just one Top-10 this year (PGA Championship) and has now missed the cut in the other three majors.\n\nLudvig Aberg, Tommy Fleetwood, Bryson DeChambeau: 9-Over\n\nSwedish phenom Ludvig Aberg entered the final major the year looking to put a final stamp on his impressive season. Aberg showed he is going to be a force to be reckoned with for years to come. But this tournament should have been humbling for the 24-year-old.\n\nAberg went 75-76 over the two days, failing to get any momentum. It might not have been his week, but expect to see Aberg on the top of leaderboards for a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy Fleetwood once again disappointed. His skills are elite and he has shown that, particularly overseas. But that did not happen this week. The Englishman is still in search of his first PGA Tour win.\n\nThen there is Bryson DeChambeau. Following his win at the U.S. Open, the American star had high hopes of winning another major. Yet, DeChambeau imploded Thursday and could not recover.\n\nKeegan Bradley: 7-Over\n\nThe final player on our list is Keegan Bradley. He finished one below the cut line and his inability to take advantage of the par-5's during this Open Championship will be something he remembers for quite some time.\n\nBradley can at least take solace in the fact that he was just named Team USA Captain for the 2025 Ryder Cup.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The missed cut ends an impressive run for the world's ninth-ranked player in this year's Grand Slam events, which include a victory at the U.S. Open, a runner-up showing at the PGA Championship and a tie for sixth place at the Masters.\n\nWinds that gusted over 30 mph and thick rough seemed to confuse DeChambeau, and his struggles on links courses continued. He has a single top-10 finish in seven starts at the game's oldest championship.\n\n\"It's a completely different test. I didn't get any practice in it, and I didn't really play much in the rain,\" he said following the first round. \"It's a difficult test out here. Something I'm not familiar with.

Twenty-two holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week. That was basically it.\n\n\"When I look back on the two majors that I didn't play my best at, here and the Masters, the wind got the better of me on Friday at Augusta, and then the wind got the better of me the last two days here.\"\n\nRobert McIntyre was always going to be one of the compelling figures coming into this Open, as a Scotsman who'd just won the Scottish Open.\n\nHe was in strong position to begin the day at 1-over par.\n\nAnd then he imploded early in his second round, going 8-over-par on his first four holes, with a pair of triple bogeys.\n\nBut McIntyre battled back to make the cut at 5-over par, thanks to playing his final 14 holes in 4-under par.\n\n\"That was carnage,\" McIntyre said of the start. \"When I made that 8 on [No.] 4, my head was completely gone. I didn't think I was going to make the weekend. After four holes, I was staring 90 in the face.\n\n\"I've got a lot of pride in myself. I saw an attitude. You could see me getting angrier and angrier and angrier. The golf game was going away from me. I was hitting stupid shots, hitting terrible shots.\n\n\"Once we calmed down, it was just simply, 'How do we get this thing in under 90' at one point, but really it was trying to break 80.\"\n\nMcIntytre said had this happened to him a year ago, \"I'd have been gone. I'd have been in my car already and up the road. The start wasn't good, but the end was good. I'm just proud of the way I fought, kind of making this cut, especially after last week.''\n\nIf you don't think making the cut at a British Open means much to millionaire golfers, look at the reaction from Max Homa after he drained a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th Friday evening to get to 6-over par, the cut line to play the weekend.\n\nIt was pure and it was priceless.\n\n\"I'm just proud of myself,'' Homa said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So, to have the chance to potentially play two more days ... I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament. It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nHoma survived a triple bogey on 12 and birdied 16 and 18 to make it on the number.\n\nScottie Scheffler, the world No. 1, is five shots off the lead at 2-under par.\n\nScheffler, who has six wins this season, has come from behind after 36 holes in six of his 11 stroke-play victories on the PGA Tour.\n\nThis is the third time in four career appearances at the Open when he's positioned inside the top 10 after 36 holes.\n\nHe's seeking to become the first player to win multiple majors in a year since Brooks Koepka (2018 U.S. Open, 2018 PGA Championship).\n\nThe last time all four majors in a year were won by players from the U.S. was 1982 (Craig Stadler/Masters Tournament, Tom Watson/U.S. Open, The Open Championship, Raymond Floyd/PGA Championship).\n\nThe top 10 players from the U.S. Open leaderboard are a combined 43-over par entering the weekend.\n\nBryson DeChambeau (9-over), Rory McIlroy (11-over), Tony Finau (10-over), Patrick Cantlay (1-under), Mathieu Pavon (2-over), Hideki Matsuyama (5-over), Sam Burns (3-over), Davis Thompson (5-over) and Corey Conners (1-under)\n\nAmong the players from LIV Golf in the Open field, nine of them made the cut, which was 6-over.\n\nDean Burmester has had the best week, at 2-under par, followed by Joaquin Niemann at even, then Dustin Johnson, Koepka, Jon Rahm at 1-over.\n\nThe LIV players who missed the cut includes Abraham Ancer (6-over), Henrik Stenson (8-over), Louis Oosthuizen (8-over), DeChambeau (9-over), Cam Smith (12-over), David Puig (14-over), John

That ended his hopes at a fourth British Open title, something that's becoming a trend for the 15-time major championship winner in recent years.\n\nWoods is now done competing until at least the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in December. His next official PGA Tour event likely won't be until the Genesis Invitational in February.\n\nThough Woods was the biggest name to miss the cut, plenty of others aren't seeing the weekend. The cutline was at 6-over after Shane Lowry took a two-shot lead over the field ahead of a windy afternoon that seemed to shut just about everybody down.\n\nWyndham Clark, who won the U.S. Open last year and earned a spot in the Olympics later this summer, finished behind Woods at 16-over after he had one of the most painful shots of the season. He completely whiffed with his ball in the high grass, and his ball went just a few feet in front of him.\n\nLudvig \u00c5berg, who finished in second at the Masters in April and T4 last week, dropped to 9-over on Friday to miss the cut. He went 6-over on a five-hole stretch on his front nine on Friday before closing with a 5-over 76. Will Zalatoris was right with him, too, and finished at 8-over on the week. Tommy Fleetwood, Viktor Hovland and Tony Finau are also headed home early. While it looked as if Max Homa was going to miss the cut, he drained a 30-footer for birdie at the last hole in order to sneak in. That prompted a massive celebration on the green.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprises, however, are with Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy. The duo, after their thrilling battle at the U.S. Open in North Carolina last month, both missed the cut after a brutal two days in Scotland.\n\nMcIlroy, who opened with a 7-over 78 on Thursday, went 6-over through his first six holes on Friday -- thanks largely to a triple bogey at the par-5 4th. He finished at 11-over in what was the second-highest 36-hole score at a major championship in his career. McIlroy has now gone a full decade without winning a major, too.\n\nDeChambeau, after a slightly-better 5-over 76 on Thursday, struggled to recover in his second round. He made the turn at 1-over on the day, and then made three bogeys on his back nine en route to a 4-over 75. That dropped him to 9-over on the week.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_young@aol.com", "name": "Ryan Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_World_Challenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero World Challenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_\u00c5berg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ludvig \u00c5berg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Furniture", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/m9s2gkK9m3a4tuupZtho_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/07255a7149f455597a90b9fba4aaa8f3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748141", "eventUri": "eng-9748141", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job, mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way -- a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Golf_National", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Le Golf National"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/iv1X-BYy6BF_4jAafUBOkB8jwDU=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/75434BZ4F3SLJMQ7HMMCQXXUKA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748141", "eventUri": "eng-9748141", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2880, "textEnd": 2886}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

But then I played the last 12 holes pretty well, bogey free.\n\n\"I think when the wind died down a little bit, or at least manageable for me, I started to play better. But if you haven't played in wind like that for quite a while, sometimes it's just hard to adapt.\"\n\nWhile DeChambeau was spotted shaking his head in befuddlement after he posted a second round of 75 to end nine over for his tournament, and Hatton was shouting angrily at his perceived failings (and of those watching on), spare a thought for Japan's Aguri Iwasaki who recorded an astonishing second round score of 91 to finish 154th on the leaderboard and 23 over par.\n\nThere were some good news stories however: the American Max Homa clawed his way into the weekend, securing his place in the top 80 players with a birdie at the 18th; Scottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre recovered from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to finish with a 32 on the back nine, a score of 75 and a place in the final two rounds.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_macinnes@theguardian.com", "name": "Paul MacInnes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3d11e05427538f74c6ba497828eafd30088cd4/0_136_4069_2442/master/4069.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3c633d6db74323a791ea789f98639c9f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748141", "eventUri": "eng-9748141", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Two more days at the British Open. And while he was still 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something goes his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was among those in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, and the Californian looked to be on the verge to taking another big step in his career. He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way -- a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut -- Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nFor all the attention on players who missed the cut, Rickie Fowler should not be overlooked. He birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 to make the cut on the number. ... Hideki Matsuyama is among 13 players who made the cut in all four majors. Xander Schauffele, the PGA champion, is tied for seventh. He has finished in the top 10 at all four majors this year. ... John Daly (swollen knee) and Ernie Els withdrew before the second round started. ... Four amateurs made the cut, led by Calum Scott of Scotland at 4-over 146. He plays at Texas Tech.\n\nAP Sports Writer Ken Maguire contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Two more days at the British Open. And while he was still 13 shots behind, it was a big moment to at least have something goes his way for the first time since April.\n\n\"Just been really not playing very well, and golf has not been very fun,\" Homa said.\n\nHe was among those in contention on the back nine at the Masters in April, and the Californian looked to be on the verge to taking another big step in his career. He has had only one top 10 since then, In the majors, he was middle-of-the-pack at the PGA Championship and he missed the cut at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I've been doing a poor job mentally,\" Homa said. \"I just felt like today for one of the first times maybe ever I just never really flinched, never blinked. I played 16 really good holes and just made two really bad swings.\"\n\nThose bad swings cost him in a big way -- a double bogey on the par-3 fifth hole, a tee shot out of play on the tough 12th that led to triple bogey. It looked certain to be a weekend off until two birdies on the last three holes, none bigger than the 18th.\n\n\"Maybe I'm just proud of myself,\" he said. \"This is my favorite tournament in the world. So to have the chance to potentially play two more days, I don't know, I had an out-of-body experience. I didn't really expect to yell like I won a golf tournament.\n\n\"It just felt really good. I felt like I fought all day.\"\n\nGoing home early\n\nIt's usually newsworthy when a highly-ranked player misses the cut in a major. There was plenty to choose from Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nFour of the top 10 players in the world missed the cut -- Rory McIlroy, Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg and Wyndham Clark.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. Also going home early were Tommy Fleetwood and Tom Kim, Sahith Theegala and Tony Finau, and newly appointed Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nFleetwood was asked to reflect on his round, and he could have been speaking for all of them.\n\n\"It's a missed cut, isn't it?\" he said. \"And it's a weekend where I don't get to play golf and have a chance.\"\n\nAnatomy of an 8 on No. 8\n\nIt's a good thing Joaquin Niemann isn't wasting time wondering what could have been. He had six birdies in some of the toughest conditions. He made only one bogey. It added to an even-par 71. And those five unaccounted shots came from one hole.\n\nNiemann found himself in all three bunkers that surround the tiny \"Postage Stamp\" green at the 123-yard eighth hole.\n\nOff the tee, he found the bunker on the right. He blasted out to the pin on the other side of the green, hit it too hard and it went in the coffin bunker. It took him two tries to get out, and the second shot went into a front bunker.\n\nNiemann finally got it on the green, and then three-putted from 20 feet for his 8.\n\n\"On the second bunker, I had a great lie and I thought I was going to be able to pull off the shot. I ended up being in my own divot,\" he said. \"So from there, I just tried to get it in play and ended up in another bunker.\"\n\nBut oh, what a recovery. He made four birdies in a six-hole stretch to start the back nine, and now he's right back in the championship.\n\n\"I was playing great before that. I started really good, and I started hitting all my golf shots,\" Niemann said. \"One hole is not going to change that.\"\n\nOlympics on tap\n\nRory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood are turning their attention to the Paris Olympics after missing the cut at Troon. The men's competition starts Aug. 1 at Le Golf National, where both players competed for Europe's winning Ryder Cup team in 2018.\n\nMcIlroy and Fleetwood were at the Tokyo Games at the last Olympics. McIlroy was part of a seven-man playoff for the bronze that C.T. Pan won.\n\nMcIlroy said now that the majors have come and gone for him, he will \"sort of refocus and try to reset for the Olympics, which will be another cool experience, and try to play well there.\"\n\nFleetwood won the 2017 French Open title at the Golf National course.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can get my game in better shape and go in and win a medal,\" he said.\n\nDivots\n\nFor all the attention on players who missed the cut, Rickie Fowler should not be overlooked. He birdied three of his last five holes for a 69 to make the cut on the number. ... Hideki Matsuyama is among 13 players who made the cut in all four majors. Xander Schauffele, the PGA champion, is tied for seventh. He has finished in the top 10 at all four majors this year. ... John Daly (swollen knee) and Ernie Els withdrew before the second round started. ... Four amateurs made the cut, led by Calum Scott of Scotland at 4-over 146. He plays at Texas Tech.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Ken Maguire contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors":

He played even-par golf in the second round, moving up into a tie for 38th to easily make the cut at 4 over.\n\nIreland's Shane Lowry, 37, tied for second after a 66 on Thursday, followed that with a 69 and has a two-stroke lead at minus-7. Lowry had a double-bogey the 11th hole but recovered with birdies on Nos. 16 and 18.\n\nHe has the lead entering the weekend despite a complicated issue involving a photographer and a fan, described in this story.\n\nTwo back are the English duo of 11-time tour winner Justin Rose, 43, and first-round leader Daniel Brown, 29, winless in two career PGA tournaments. Rose shot a 68 that included birdies on the popular 16th and 18th holes, while Brown carded a 72 the day after he posted a bogey-free 65.\n\nThree players are tied for fourth place at 2 under, including world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who had a 70 for the second day in a row.\n\nHoma, who has either failed to make the cut or finished outside the top 20 in his past six starts, had a double-bogey on the fifth hole before pulling back even with birdies on Nos. 8 and 9.\n\nHis triple-bogey on the 12th left him in a deep hole and pars on 13, 14 and 15 didn't help. But Homa delivered oen of the biggest shots of his career on the 18th to sneak into the weekend along with 11 others who finished the first two days at plus-6.\n\nThat's how difficult the tournament has been, thanks to heavy winds on the west coast of Scotland, some rain and tall, thick grasses off the fairways.\n\nMorikawa included four birdies and played 3 under through the final eight holes to finish in a tie with Jon Rahm, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and others at 1 over for the tournament.\n\nAn had a wild round that included five birdies three bogeys and a double-bogey but made the cut at The Open for the seventh time in his career. His best finish was 23rd place last year.\n\nOthers who didn't make the cut included No. 2-ranked Rory McIlroy, whose 75 Friday left him at 11 over. McIlroy careened off course early with a triple-bogey and three bogeys over the first six holes.\n\nTiger Woods followed Thursday's 79 with a 77 to miss the cut at plus-14 and tied for 144th place. The 48-year-old icon now has missed the cut or withdrawn in six of his past seven majors and is done for the season.\n\n\"I loved it.

Here's why there's hope for the weekend", "body": "Some stars, like Tiger Woods, are out of the Open while others, like Xander Schauffele, remain\n\nThere's a strange melancholy to the halfway mark of the Open Championship.\n\nFor golf fans in the U.K. those first two days are sporting festivals, with proper golfers facing proper golf tests from sunup to sundown, some small seaside town overrun with enthusiastic spectators, lively chatter about what could be on the rope line and at the pubs, the tournament bursting at the seams with possibility. For American fans those first two days are a rare joy, too: an excuse to stay up late or get up early, to feel some childlike excitement turning on the TV to see what's already unfolded in the elements across the pond.\n\nBy Friday night that's done. The infinite possibilities of what could be have been replaced by a smaller, finite set of potential weekend outcomes; it's natural to do some grieving for what could have been. Take Tommy Fleetwood, for instance, who grew up several hours down the coast from Troon, has been one of the game's most consistent performers on links courses and seems destined to win one of these at some point. But when he double bogeyed the ninth hole on Friday it became clear that this would not be his year; he wouldn't even make the weekend.\n\n\"Yeah, look, conditions are tough, the golf course is tough. But it's your job to figure it out and to put in a score, and I just couldn't do that,\" he said. \"I'll reflect and start again.\"\n\nThat weighty Friday feeling has only increased this past half-decade, when the PGA Championship pivoted to May and the Open became the final men's major of the year. For golfers this event now means one last chance to claim a life-changing title before the long wait for next year's Masters begins. Avid golf fans face a reality almost as jarring: major championship season denotes summertime, and when the long nights of the Open Championship have come and gone, the possibilities of the season have, too.\n\nFleetwood is hardly alone in his disappointment leaving Royal Troon. Even as a fan favorite and pre-tournament betting favorite he's still not among the biggest names to head home early.\n\nThere's Tiger Woods, still gamely fighting his fight against Father Time, who has come back from injury and looked progressively healthier each tournament this year but has run into the equally insidious challenge of rust. He made the cut at the Masters but wasn't close at the next two and wasn't close this week, either, bowing out at 14 over par and beating just a handful of competitors.\n\nThere's Rory McIlroy, who suffered a heartbreaking defeat at Pinehurst in last month's U.S. Open but seemed destined to bounce back and contend at Troon -- but then he bombed out with a seven-over 78 in the opening round and was another six over par in his first six holes Friday, by which point his mind was wandering to vacation, a far less consequential quest than that for a fifth major after a decade sitting on four.\n\nThere's Bryson DeChambeau, the man who beat McIlroy at Pinehurst, one of golf's great characters and competitors, who was having the best major season of anyone in the world before he shot nine-over par for two days and headed for the exits early.\n\nThere are others, too. Ludvig Aberg, who has climbed to World No. 4 in his first full PGA Tour season but shot nine over for two days. World No. 5 Wyndham Clark, whose mystifying major play continued with a two-day total of 16-over par. Viktor Hovland, who is still searching, and Sahith Theegala, still looking for his best at the biggest moments, and Tom Kim, a trendy pick this week, and Tony Finau, whose opening 71 was betrayed by his Friday 81 and Keegan Bradley, who hopes to play his way onto the Ryder Cup team he'll captain next year but who missed the cut by one agonizing shot. Their stories have reached their end for this major season. See you in April.\n\nThis remains the beauty of cut lines. Friday evening at the Open can be about those guys -- their could-have-beens and missed opportunities. That's fine. But Saturday we get something far cheerier: a mad dash to the finish at the year's final major. This third round is no exception: beyond the flashy absences this is a tournament bursting with potential weekend drama.\n\nAt the top there's Shane Lowry, proud Irishman, who this year is celebrating the five-year anniversary of his storybook triumph at Royal Portrush and would very much like to do so by lifting the claret jug again. He leads by two at seven-under par after a turbulent Friday that served as a reminder of just how much fun it is to watch him scrap his way through the elements.\n\nThere are the Englishmen in second place at five-under par, Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, the former an aging thoroughbred chasing another day in the sun and the latter an unproven, unheralded dark horse whose first moment in golf's limelight came Thursday afternoon.\n\nThere's the imposing presence of Scottie Scheffler in T4, just three players and five shots separating him from the lead. He's the second betting favorite behind Lowry and it's easy to see why; there's an inevitability to his presence on these leaderboards and in a year as dominant as his it would feel strangely lacking if he won just a single major.\n\nThere are LIV golfers without majors and with uncertain futures chasing world ranking points and prestige and a long-term place in these events, guys like Dean Burmester in T4, five back and Joaquin Niemann in T11, seven back. There are LIV golfers with multiple majors chasing one more, notably the trio of Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka -- each lurking at one-over par, eight shots back.\n\nThere's the fascinating duo of Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay, frequent practice-round sparring partners and U.S. teammates with remarkably similar careers -- similar, that is, until Schauffele won this year's PGA Championship. The two played together Thursday and Friday and they're paired together on Saturday, too. It's plausible by Sunday evening Cantlay could now draw equal or that Schauffele could ascend to the game's next level. One major is table stakes for a great career, after all. Two gets you invited to a different party. There's a former World No. 1, Jason Day (T7, six back) looking for his second, too, fully familiar of the joys of one and the desire for one more.\n\nThere are PGA Tour players whose solid careers could elevate with a win, guys like Billy Horschel (T4, five back) or Corey Conners (T7, six back). And there's a pesky U.K. underdog, England's Matthew Jordan (T11, seven back), who has invited himself to weekend contention for the second year in a row.\n\nMostly there's Troon, its coastline and its pot bunkers and the wind that whips off the former and through the latter. And there's the institution of the Open, and of golf's majors, which have proven their strength even as other foundations of the game have shaken. The players matter, of course. Their star power matters. But the way they gather here, the way they play for the claret jug in this setting -- the tournament remains greater than the individuals comprising its field. So it's worth mourning the absence of some of the field's star-studded blue-chippers Friday night. It's worth considering, over a pint, what could have been but will not be.\n\nThen it's time to rest up for the conclusion of the Open Championship, its two final, glorious rounds, knowing just how much you'll miss it when it's gone.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki",

Like I said, it's very important to have your mental rest, especially on the weekend.\"\n\nAfter six bogies in the opening 12 holes, Scott rallied late with a birdie on 17 to return to 5-over, which placed him one shot inside of the cut.\n\nBut the former Masters winner looked shell-shocked as he assessed an especially testing day in a chat after the round with foxsports.com.au.\n\nAfter finishing runner-up in the Scottish Open last week and among only 17 players to finish under par on Thursday, as his score ballooned on Friday, Scott had to reassure himself that he could actually play the game as the bogeys started to flow.\n\n\"I've found myself in this position a lot, it feels like, over the last few years,\" he said.\n\n\"I just kept plugging away (and) somehow I did not let what happened out there on the front 12 holes make you think you can play golf. But that's really hard. But I kept hitting some good shots coming in, so that felt good.\"\n\nScott pumped his fist in defiance after making the putt at 17, which seemed crucial at the time given the cut was hovering at 5-over before ultimately landing one shot further back.\n\n\"I just told myself to just give it a run at the hole and hopefully the hole gets in the way,\" he said.\n\n\"I hit a few good parts and then one went in at 17. I mean, it's a pride thing, honestly, to make the cut and be here for the weekend. But it's now on a prayer that you're thinking about winning the tournament. I'd have to go and shoot a hell of a round.\"\n\nScott will be playing this weekend when champions including Cameron Smith, who fared better on Friday but still finished at 12-over, Rory McIlroy (+11), Bryson deChambeau (+9) and Tiger Woods (+14) are among those headed home.\n\nMin Woo Lee started Friday even with the card but shot a 9-over 80 in a horror round that matched Smith's opening day disaster, while Elvis Smylie and Jasper Stubbs (+10) also endured a testing introduction to the British Open on their debuts.\n\nBut Scott was far from surprised with some of the massive scores recorded over the first two days.\n\nHe said few modern-day players were used to playing in conditions where it was better to shape balls lower to the ground and rely on run and bounce, hence the scorecard blowouts.\n\n\"lt is (incredibly difficult). You have to really strike your shots pure,\" he said.\n\n\"They have to start on such a tight line to where you're looking and, to be honest, I think all of us probably aren't used to seeing the ball move this much up in the air, and it's very hard for us to put it on the ground when that's not what we have played.\n\n\"The confidence isn't there to bang a five iron down along the ground from 150 (metres out) and run it into the front. We all hit it up in the air and it moves from the right edge of the green across to the left edge and then it kicks in the hay. It's really difficult out there.\n\n\"But there are a few guys who have obviously managed it better than others, but once it starts going the wrong way, it's really hard to figure out what to do, because your go-to (game) is not working. And then you are just battling.\"\n\nStubbs, who enjoyed some good moments on Friday after a torrid start on Thursday, has been on the road since the end of May and will head to the US for more amateur events.\n\nThe Melburnian is hopeful of defending the Asia Pacific Amateur Championship which earned him a spot in the US Masters and British Open to enable him to return next year.\n\n\"It was a very awesome day. Obviously the conditions were testing, but I felt like I handled it pretty well. (I'm) very happy with the day. It's a nice end to the week,\" he said.\n\n\"How the tournament is run is amazing compared to what I've played on the amateur circuit. We get treated like kings here, so it's amazing to see the other side of it, which is really cool.\n\n\"I love playing in front of a crowd and feeling the energy off them, and they've been pretty similar between the Masters and The Open as well, so it's pretty awesome to see.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Woo_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Min Woo Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firth of Clyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elvis Presley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amateur_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Amateur Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c5bee1436216ea45afb64bb7f2482cab", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748141", "eventUri": "eng-9748141", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Forlow grew up in Brentwood\u2019s downtown art deco-style Delta Theater, which her family bought in 1955 and owned and operated for nearly two decades. She saw all the classics \u2014 \u201cThe Ten Commandments,\u201d \u201cBen-Hur,\u201d \u201cHercules\u201d and many more \u2013 and she\u2019s anxious to see the nearly 100-year-old movie palace reopen after a four-year closure. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole big difference between a 50-inch screen in your house and a screen at the movie theater \u2013 a huge difference,\u201d said Forlow, now an East Contra Costa Historical Society museum archivist. \u201cWhen I see people watch movies on their phone, I go, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just watch it on a postage stamp?\u2019 The bigger the screen, the better for me.\u201d Forlow will soon get her wish, as Sean McCauley and partner Ron Harrison and their crew work feverishly to restore the 1937-era movie theater at 641 First St. for a late May opening. Despite competition from other movie houses, such as the 14-screen theater at the Streets of Brentwood shopping center several miles away, local redevelopers believe the restored iconic two-screen theater will be a big draw. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really want to buy it, but the former owners weren\u2019t going to put a lot of money into that particular building,\u201d McCauley said of his 2019 purchase. \u201cWe knew it was the anchor of downtown Brentwood, and that\u2019s the only building that brings 1,000 people a day, on a weekend, to downtown.\u201d But McCauley, who by himself and with Harrison, has bought and renovated some 10 buildings downtown, said refurbishing and reopening the theater makes sense \u201cto keep the momentum\u201d of \u201cbusinesses thriving there.\u201d With chain and other retail stores locating elsewhere, Brentwood\u2019s city center was \u201cmore of a ghost town\u201d until it started to turn into \u201ca more social area,\u201d starting in 2016 with upscale restaurants like Zephyr\u2019s Grill and Bar in a building he had refurbished, he said. \u201cThe downtown district is a social district now, and we\u2019re seeing a lot of downtown districts such as Martinez and even San Francisco, Antioch and now Brentwood, turning that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBack when I was a kid, it was more retail.\u201d McCauley, though, acknowledged the timing turned out to be tough as the COVID-19 pandemic hit shortly after he bought the theater, then-called Cinelux Delta Cinema, which was forced to close in 2020. \u201cWe got hit with this perfect storm of of bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to do a humongous remodel, and with COVID, the city was closed down and the operator bailed.\u201d McCauley said that the pandemic changed movie-going and the former operator has since then \u201cbeen instrumental in helping us open back up again.\u201d Even so, McCauley and his partner decided to operate the new movie house themselves, though they did hire someone to direct the day-to-day operations. \u201cNetflix, Prime Video and streaming killed the theater after COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cThe movie industry is way different than it is today. The theater business is definitely not what it was.\u201d McCauley, though, is optimistic that things will be different in Brentwood because of all the support he\u2019s received so far from residents. \u201cThe difference is we\u2019re trying to keep our prices low, there\u2019s that whole charm of Brentwood and the old-town charm of that particular theater,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen legitimately, like, crazy-good support from Brentwood residents.\u201d Tickets will range from $8 to $12, depending on the seat and whether there\u2019s a student or senior discount, while Tuesdays \u2014 as in the past \u2014 will also be reserved for bargain-priced movies, he said. As for renovations, McCauley said he has tried to keep \u201cthe old-town, old-school vibe of this particular theater\u201d even as they install a variety of new, high-end vinyl reclining seats along with non-reclining ones, duet romantic seats for couples, new screens, a state-of-the-art digital sound system and all-new digital equipment. They even took over the space from an adjacent former candy store to add \u201cbeautiful, new modern bathrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did a lot of research on what it was like, but then we put the really cool amenities that we have in theaters today,\u201d McCauley said of the now 200-seat venue. Perhaps the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, though, is the renovation of the foyer back to its open-air design and restoration of the marquee and the green \u201cDelta\u201d sign with neon pink lights to their 1937 splendor, which alone cost more than $100,000 and detailed work from numerous contractors, the owner said. \u201cOur biggest concern was just how it looked back when we were kids, back when I came here in 1970,\u201d McCauley said. \u201cI just wanted it to look like more the way it was originally built, so we took out that front door area that they put in in the \u201890s and we opened back up to be more original.\u201d Josh Caudle, hired to handle day-to-day theater operations, said he\u2019s been impressed with McCauley\u2019s dedication to restore the art deco theater back to its original 1930s\u2019 look. \u201cIf we had kept it the other way (with a closed foyer), I would have had more lobby space; I could have generated more dollars per square foot,\u201d Caudle said, noting McCauley was more interested in authentic restoration. \u201cI love that that was the first thing that he prioritized.\u201d \u201cIn terms of the entire experience, there\u2019s going to be some nice aesthetic touches that you just don\u2019t see anywhere else,\u201d Caudle said. Gold curtains also have been added to the theater\u2019s stage, which will also be available for fundraisers, comedy shows, theatrical events and talks by local film celebrities, he said. \u201cWell just try a lot of different stuff,\u201d Caudle said. \u201cBasically, it\u2019s not just movies anymore.\u201d In the early days, that was also the case, Forlow said. Her mother, Rose Pierce, a Spanish speaker, made sure she included Mexican films and entertainment. She remembers mariachi groups and other Mexican entertainers performing at the Delta, including the immensely popular film star Cantinflas and exotic dancer Tonga Lilly. \u201cWe had a lot of farm laborers back then and we catered to their entertainment,\u201d she said. In the 1950s, The Great Toussaint, a master hypnotist and magician entertained there. Forlow claimed that her father had to call him back from Stockton after a show when he found a woman still hypnotized in the back of the dark theater at the end of the night. Though the new Delta Theater doesn\u2019t have magic or hypnotist shows planned, it might seem like a step back in time for theatergoers when they watch some of the decades-old cartoons \u2014 including the original Superman series \u2014 Caudle has planned before the movies and during the Saturday farmers markets. And, then there\u2019s the food, which will have a modern touch, with items such as homemade pizza, panini sandwiches, pretzels and at least a handful of gourmet items on the menu, McCauley said. Anthony Roost of Attraversiamo, a Brentwood farm-to-table restaurant, is designing the locally sourced menu, he said. Wine and beer \u2013 all of it local \u2013 also will be served, he said. Of course, there will be popcorn. Caudle said it will be prepared in a high-end popping machine with a tumbler to evenly coat the kernels with hot butter in a variety of flavors, including red-hot Ghost Pepper Popcorn. \u201cWe\u2019re really not going cheap on anything in there,\u201d McCauley said of the $15,000 popcorn machine.", "summary": "Gourmet food, local wine, bar and new reclining seats, modern bathrooms among the amenities.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/05/26/historic-bay-area-movie-theater-gets-a-full-renovation-and-a-modern-twist/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EBT-L-DELTATHEAT-XX-1.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:15:08", "author": "Judith Prieve", "authors": ["Judith Prieve"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.198}

{"id": 232085364, "title": "So which is cheapest for a three-month sabbatical in retirement... a Cunard cruise, a Park Lane...", "text": "Have you ever dreamt of taking a sabbatical in retirement from household management, saying goodbye to daily chores and putting your feet up for a few months? If you decide to escape, which would be the best value: a world cruise; a five-star hotel in London; or living in a luxury apartment in a retirement community? Three tempting alternatives, all priced differently, with different levels of inclusions in the cost and optional extras. Let\u2019s have a look. THE LUXURY WORLD CRUISE 107 nights \u2013 \u00a349,466 for two You can sail away from Southampton on glamorous new Cunard cruise ship Queen Anne on January 9. The route takes you to the sunny Americas, Australasia, South East Asia, the Gulf and Mediterranean, arriving home when spring is sprung. On the 107-night circumnavigation of the globe, as well as breakfast, lunch and dinner, afternoon tea is served by white-gloved waiters in the Queens Ballroom every day, and should you still be peckish you can order room service any time of night or day, all included in the fare. As well as the four main dining rooms (allocated by cabin grade) and buffet restaurant, there is a choice of many other places to eat costing extra. Entertainment ranges from the well-stocked library to pub quizzes, deck games, lectures and art classes to dancing to the orchestra in the ballroom, concerts and plays in the theatre, gala dinners and the captain\u2019s cocktail party. On a tour that includes New York, the Panama Canal, Sydney and Hawaii, you\u2019ll visit 28 destinations in 18 countries and relax for 68 days at sea with time to lounge beside the pool. The cost for two people sharing an ocean view cabin with a good-sized window is from \u00a337,298 (cunard.com) working out at \u00a3348.60 per cabin per night, for two. But there are further costs that must be taken into account. Although service charges \u2013 that apply on shorter cruises from $16pp (\u00a312.50) per day; \u00a325 per couple \u2013 are included in the fare on world voyages, using the internet is not, costing $1,444.50 (about \u00a31,136) for the basic package for just one device \u2013 about \u00a310.60 a day. You\u2019ll also need to add compulsory travel insurance, offered from a not inconsiderable \u00a311,032.70 for a couple by Holiday Extras (holidayextras.com), Cunard\u2019s recommended insurance provider. It all adds up to \u00a349,466.70, about \u00a3462.30 for two per night. 5 STAR LONDON HOTEL 107 nights \u2013 \u00a350,386 If you prefer to stay put while being waited on in style, with plenty to see and do in easy reach, a long stay in a five-star hotel in the capital ticks those boxes. Check in to the Hilton Park Lane and you\u2019ll never have the bother of making the bed, a concierge will help with sightseeing advice and theatre bookings and you\u2019ll have the freedom to dine in or out with a vast choice of restaurants nearby \u2013 but unlike a cruise, meals are an extra cost. The hotel\u2019s brasserie has two courses for \u00a322 and three for \u00a326. All rooms have kettles, coffee machines and mini fridges, so you could save on the hotel breakfast (up to \u00a344pp) by making your own. You\u2019ll have Hyde Park and Green Park on your doorstep and free museums such as the V&A, National Gallery, Tate Britain and Wallace Collection within 30 minutes walk, or a short bus ride (free with older person\u2019s bus passes from other regions of England). And hotel guests can go to the gym, sauna and steam room without charge. Canny bookers will get the best room rates through the Hilton Honors programme, which is free to join and has the benefit of free internet and bottled water and other perks, plus clocking up points for future stays. To stay at the Hilton Park Lane for the same dates as the Cunard cruise, January 9 to April 27, 2025 \u2013 107 nights in a park or city view, double room, the total cost would be from \u00a339,686.26. Add, say, a modest \u00a350pp a day for meals (\u00a310,700) and it all adds up to \u00a350,386.26 \u2013 from about \u00a3471 a night for two. RETIREMENT COMMUNITY 107 nights \u2013 \u00a356,280 A more permanent option that is becoming increasingly popular among well-off older people is renting, rather than buying, an apartment in a luxury retirement community. Auriens Chelsea, a complex of 56 flats for well-heeled over-65s in the smart London neighbourhood, has the air of a swish hotel, with hot and cold running attentive staff. The head chef of the private restaurant is a former head chef at the Savoy. And the restaurant and bar manager is from the Mayfair club, Annabel\u2019s. Daily housekeeping of your flat can be arranged, along with other extra services. There is a gym and spa on site, and the beautifully tended garden, designed by a Chelsea Flower Show gold medal winner, is a tranquil spot to read with a coffee. Residents can be as private or as social as they like and are offered a programme of events and activities, such as joining the choir, book talks and piano recitals. Located off the King\u2019s Road, Auriens is just a stroll up to the Royal Court Theatre, Cadogan Hall and Peter Jones department store on Sloane Square, or over the river to Battersea Park. For this carefree life in a one-bedroom apartment, rent starts at \u00a316,000 a month, covering maintenance, utilities, council tax, broadband, telephone and TV package and television licence \u2013 but not meals. That\u2019s \u00a3192,000 a year. To compare the cost of living in Auriens (auriens.com) for the same period as the 107-night Cunard world cruise or hotel stay, we can divide the annual rent by 365 (\u00a3526.27 a day) and multiply by 107. The result is \u00a356,280.93 for two people plus restaurant bills (Sunday roast in the restaurant is \u00a360pp), or the cost of food to be prepared and eaten at home. So the least expensive way of spending just over 15 weeks cocooned in comfort is the Cunard (cunard.com) world cruise on full board at \u00a3462 a night per couple. Coming close behind is the hotel stay at the Hilton Park Lane (hilton.com), but eating more sparingly, at \u00a3471 a night for two. And in third place, Auriens Chelsea retirement community, a long-term commitment with no meals included at \u00a3526 a night.", "summary": "Have you ever dreamt of taking a sabbatical in retirement from household management, saying goodbye to daily chores and putting your feet up for a few months?", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/mailplus/article-13510701/So-cheapest-three-month-sabbatical-retirement-Cunard-cruise-Park-Lane-hotel-luxury-village-65s.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/09/13/85895951-0-image-a-45_1717936800354.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:55:34", "author": "Caroline Hendrie,Editor", "authors": ["Caroline Hendrie", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.42}

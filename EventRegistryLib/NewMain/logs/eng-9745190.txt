He previously came from Purdue University, where he served as provost, dean of the agriculture college and in various other leadership positions.\n\nUnder his long tenure at NC State, Woodson led the university in increasing graduation and retention rates and research funding.

Appalachian State's former Chancellor Sheri Everts was the most recent chancellor to step down in April.\n\nThe search for UNC-Chapel Hill's new chancellor -- a position opened after former Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz left in January -- progressed further on Wednesday when search committee members started considering candidates. The chancellorship is currently held by Interim Chancellor Lee Roberts, who GOP legislative leaders have signaled support in becoming the next chancellor.\n\nThe search committee has been \"aggressively in the market\" for several weeks to find suitable candidates, but competition with other universities conducting chancellor searches has presented challenges, said Laurie Wilder, head of search firm Parker Executive Search, during the meeting.\n\nHans told reporters after the meeting that he thought the high turnover of chancellors could be partly attributed to university leaders postponing their departures to ensure administrations ran smoothly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Another chancellor in North Carolina's public university system has announced plans to step down -- this time at the state's largest university by enrollment.\n\nNorth Carolina State University Chancellor Randy Woodson declared his retirement plans at the university's trustees meeting Thursday, capping off nearly 15 years in his role. His term will officially end June 30, 2025, Woodson said.\n\nHis departure marks yet another chancellor vacancy in the University of North Carolina system that is in the process of filling three other openings, including the state's flagship campus, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Seventeen schools are members of the system.\n\n\"I feel good about leaving the institution better than I found it, but I also feel good that the next leader has plenty to do at NC State,\" Woodson said during the meeting. \"This is a great place.\"\n\nWith his contract ending next June, Woodson told reporters it was \"just a good time\" for him to step away from being chancellor. Retirement was something the 67-year-old said he considered for a while.\n\nWoodson received a two-year contract extension in 2021 that allowed him to serve until 2025 -- something UNC System President Peter Hans said he \"twisted his arm at the time to stay.\"\n\n\"When I think about where NC State was 15 years and where NC State is now, it's an extraordinary testament to this man's leadership and the team he has built around him,\" Hans told reporters after the meeting.\n\nWoodson started in his role as NC State chancellor in 2010. He previously came from Purdue University, where he served as provost, dean of the agriculture college and in various other leadership positions.\n\nUnder his long tenure at NC State, Woodson led the university in increasing graduation and retention rates and research funding. The university's enrollment also has grown to more than 37,000 students as of Fall 2023.\n\nHis term included radical changes in the college athletics landscape, including the Atlantic Coast Conference adding the University of Pittsburgh and Syracuse University in all sports, adding the University of Notre Dame in all non-football league sports, as well as the league's move to add Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley, and Southern Methodist University this year.\n\nHe is the university's third longest-serving chancellor and one of the longest currently serving in the university system.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have immediate plans for what's next after his chancellorship, Woodson said he intends to stay in Raleigh.\n\nWoodson's announcement means yet another chancellor search for the UNC system to embark on after filling four openings in the last year. Those new chancellors now lead four universities: James Martin at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Karrie Dixon at North Carolina Central University, Bonita Brown at Winston-Salem State University and Kimberly van Noort at UNC-Asheville.\n\nThree other universities currently have chancellor openings: Appalachian State University, Elizabeth City State University and UNC-Chapel Hill. Appalachian State's former Chancellor Sheri Everts was the most recent chancellor to step down in April.\n\nThe search for UNC-Chapel Hill's new chancellor -- a position opened after former Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz left in January -- progressed further on Wednesday when search committee members started considering candidates. The chancellorship is currently held by Interim Chancellor Lee Roberts, who GOP legislative leaders have signaled support in becoming the next chancellor.\n\nThe search committee has been \"aggressively in the market\" for several weeks to find suitable candidates, but competition with other universities conducting chancellor searches has presented challenges, said Laurie Wilder, head of search firm Parker Executive Search, during the meeting.\n\nHans told reporters after the meeting that he thought the high turnover of chancellors could be partly attributed to university leaders postponing their departures to ensure administrations ran smoothly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press writer Aaron Beard in Raleigh contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

With a research background in molecular plant biology, he joined NC State after more than two decades at Purdue University in Indiana, where he became provost in 2008.\n\n\"Under Woodson's leadership, NC State has become a preeminent research enterprise known for solving real-world challenges -- a true Think and Do university,\" his biography states, referencing the university's motto.\n\n\"His strategic vision has enabled the university to advance in areas of student success, innovative research and collaborative partnerships. This has resulted in students ready to solve real-world challenges, public-private partnerships that transform ideas into solutions, and a creative, engaging center of learning and exploration for all.\"\n\nWoodson's announcement of his upcoming retirement comes at a time of significant turnover for chancellors across the UNC System. Already this year, new leaders have been named for four universities in the 17-campus system, and three additional searches are underway or soon-to-begin.\n\nUNC System President Peter Hans addressed the turnover Wednesday after a meeting of the ongoing UNC-Chapel Hill chancellor search, saying he attributed much of the trend to natural cycles, such as chancellors reaching their retirements or choosing to make changes in their career after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut at a time when the average tenure for college presidents and chancellors nationwide is less than six years, Woodson's nearly 15-year tenure at NC State stands out.\n\nWoodson is one of the longest-serving chancellors currently in the UNC System. (North Carolina A&T State University Chancellor Harold Martin, who officially retires next month, is the longest-serving.) He is the third-longest-serving chancellor in NC State history.\n\nUniversity leaders have made efforts to keep Woodson at the helm of NC State over the past decade: The UNC System Board of Governors and then-system President Tom Ross in 2015 entered into a contract with Woodson, indicating their \"desire\" for him to remain in the role until at least 2019. The contract, according to documents previously obtained by The News & Observer, has been extended on two occasions, with the most recent version -- signed in 2021 -- set to expire in June 2025.\n\nThe same year his contract was last extended, Woodson was the highest-paid public university chancellor or president in the country, bringing in $2.3 million in 2021. That compensation included a $1.5 million performance bonus as part of a retention package set up by the NC State Board of Trustees in 2015. He and his wife, Susan, donated the bonus back to the university to support student scholarships.\n\nAmong Woodson's significant accomplishments as chancellor are a major increase in student retention and graduation rates, an increase in applications for admission, the completion of a 10-year strategic plan and the beginning of another, and a $2.1 billion \"Think and Do the Extraordinary\" campaign, which supported scholarships, research, programs and facilities at the university.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Woodson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Randy Woodson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_State_Wolfpack_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NC State Wolfpack men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_State_Wolfpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NC State Wolfpack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provost (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purdue University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_A&T_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina A&T State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_&_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The News & Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/charlotte_observer_mcclatchy_513/ce3c0d96409946ebc5ccaa5cf4223f1b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745190", "eventUri": "eng-9745190", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Another chancellor in North Carolina's public university system has announced plans to step down -- this time at the state's largest university by enrollment.\n\nNorth Carolina State University Chancellor Randy Woodson declared his retirement plans at the university's trustees meeting Thursday, capping off nearly 15 years in his role. His term will officially end June 30, 2025, Woodson said.\n\nHis departure marks yet another chancellor vacancy in the University of North Carolina system that is in the process of filling three other openings, including the state's flagship campus, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Seventeen schools are members of the system.\n\n\"I feel good about leaving the institution better than I found it, but I also feel good that the next leader has plenty to do at NC State,\" Woodson said during the meeting. \"This is a great place.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Retirement was something the 67-year-old said he considered for a while.\n\nWoodson received a two-year contract extension in 2021 that allowed him to serve until 2025 -- something UNC System President Peter Hans said he \"twisted his arm at the time to stay.\"\n\n\"When I think about where NC State was 15 years and where NC State is now, it's an extraordinary testament to this man's leadership and the team he has built around him,\" Hans told reporters after the meeting.\n\nWoodson started in his role as NC State chancellor in 2010. He previously came from Purdue University, where he served as provost, dean of the agriculture college and in various other leadership positions.\n\nUnder his long tenure at NC State, Woodson led the university in increasing graduation and retention rates and research funding. The university's enrollment also has grown to more than 37,000 students as of Fall 2023.\n\nHis term included radical changes in the college athletics landscape, including the Atlantic Coast Conference adding the University of Pittsburgh and Syracuse University in all sports, adding the University of Notre Dame in all non-football league sports, as well as the league's move to add Stanford University, the University of California, Berkeley, and Southern Methodist University this year.\n\nHe is the university's third longest-serving chancellor and one of the longest currently serving in the university system.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have immediate plans for what's next after his chancellorship, Woodson said he intends to stay in Raleigh.\n\nWoodson's announcement means yet another chancellor search for the UNC system to embark on after filling four openings in the last year. Those new chancellors now lead four universities: James Martin at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Karrie Dixon at North Carolina Central University, Bonita Brown at Winston-Salem State University and Kimberly van Noort at UNC-Asheville.\n\nThree other universities currently have chancellor openings: Appalachian State University, Elizabeth City State University and UNC-Chapel Hill. Appalachian State's former Chancellor Sheri Everts was the most recent chancellor to step down in April.\n\nThe search for UNC-Chapel Hill's new chancellor -- a position opened after former Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz left in January -- progressed further on Wednesday when search committee members started considering candidates. The chancellorship is currently held by Interim Chancellor Lee Roberts, who GOP legislative leaders have signaled support in becoming the next chancellor.\n\nThe search committee has been \"aggressively in the market\" for several weeks to find suitable candidates, but competition with other universities conducting chancellor searches has presented challenges, said Laurie Wilder, head of search firm Parker Executive Search, during the meeting.\n\nHans told reporters after the meeting that he thought the high turnover of chancellors could be partly attributed to university leaders postponing their departures to ensure administrations ran smoothly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press writer Aaron Beard in Raleigh contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(WTVD) -- North Carolina State University will soon be looking for a new chancellor because Randy Woodson announced he will be retiring on June 30, 2025.\n\nWoodson made the announcement Thursday afternoon during a regularly scheduled NC State Board of Trustees meeting at Park Alumni Center.\n\n\"For 14 years, Randy Woodson has perfectly captured the pragmatic brilliance of NC State,\" said UNC System President Peter Hans. \"Like the university he leads, Randy is sharp, good-natured, and eager to get things done for North Carolina. It's made him a great colleague and one of the most effective leaders in this state.\"\n\nWoodson is credited with implementing plans that grew the university's influence, infrastructure and reputation. Graduation rates and retention rates also saw improvements under Woodson.\n\n\"Under Chancellor Woodson's visionary leadership, North Carolina State University has transformed into one of our nation's preeminent public research universities. Chancellor Woodson will leave a lasting legacy of innovation and success, and I want to thank him for his steadfast dedication to advancing knowledge and enriching the lives of countless individuals in North Carolina and beyond through his service to the NC State community,\" Sen. Thom Tillis said in a statement.\n\nWoodson, 67, took over as the university's 14th chancellor in April 2010. That 14-year tenure is extremely long for the leader of an American university.\n\nBefore arriving at NC State, Woodson was an internationally renowned plant molecular biologist. He specialized in the reproductive processes of agricultural crops. He also served as a provost and vice chancellor at Purdue University.\n\nWoodson's announcement is just the latest in a string of upheavals for universities in North Carolina.\n\nKevin Guskiewicz left the University of North Carolina to take over as president at Michigan State University. He was replaced by Lee Roberts as interim chancellor, but a fulltime chancellor announcement has not yet been made for UNC.\n\nAfter nearly nine months of searching, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T), the country's largest historically Black university (HBCU), has a new chancellor. In late June, UNC Board of Governors announced James Martin II would lead NC A&T.\n\nThe chancellor search at NC A&T was initially prompted in September when Chancellor Harold L. Martin announced his retirement. His retirement came after 15 years serving as North Carolina A&T chancellor.\n\nNorth Carolina Central University named a new chancellor June 6. The selection was Dr. Karrie G. Dixon, who had been serving as Elizabeth City State University's chancellor. Elizabeth City State University then chose Dr. Catherine Edmonds as interim chancellor to fill the opening.\n\nBack in May, Bonita J. Brown was elected as chancellor of Winston-Salem State University. She began her tenue on July 1. She succeeded Interim Chancellor Anthony Graham and former Chancellor Elwood Robinson, who retired in 2023.\n\nFarther west, the chancellor of Appalachian State University stepped down back in April citing her health. Sheri Everts had been chancellor since 2014. Dr. Heather Hulburt Norris was appointed interim chancellor shortly after Everts stepped down.", "source": {"uri": "abc11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "abc11 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

NC State has the largest enrollment in the UNC System with more than 37,000 students in the fall of 2023.\n\nWoodson's contract expires at the end of the 2024-25 school year. He received a two-year extension in 2021.\n\nSpokespersons for NC State and the UNC System did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nPeople familiar with his plans say the retirement has been in the works since before the university came under scrutiny for its handling of complaints about air quality at an academic building. Hundreds of people who worked in Poe Hall have reported a diagnosis of cancer to 5 On Your Side.\n\nAs a result of the university's handling of the Poe Hall situation, the faculty of the university's College of Education voted in February that they didn't have confidence in Woodson.\n\nThe university is currently working on plans to remediate toxic chemicals found in the building's air handler after conducting two rounds of testing.\n\nFreshman enrollment at the university is up more than 65% since the start of his tenure with increases in first-year retention and five-year graduation rates. During his tenure, NC State has seen a large increase in federal research grants.\n\nThe UNC System has three chancellor vacancies, including an on-going search at UNC-Chapel Hill. Four other chancellors started in 2024.\n\nWoodson taught at Louisiana State before joining the faculty at Purdue University in Indiana, where he held a number of posts including dean of the agriculture school and, eventually, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs.

It's made him a great colleague and one of the most effective leaders in this state.\"\n\nUnder Woodson's leadership, NC State developed two 10-year strategic plans that set the priorities of the university's progress in many areas including enhancing student success, and organizational excellence, investing in faculty and infrastructure and supporting interdisciplinary scholarships.\n\nAlso during his tenure, NC State created, implemented and completed \"The Pathway to the Future,\". The strategic plan was credited with elevating the university's recognition among the nation's top public research universities. In 2021, \"Wolfpack 2030: Powering the Extraordinary\" was created. This strategic plan focused on building on this momentum and carry the university even further.\n\nWoodson also led the university's most ambitious fundraising campaign in it's history, a $1.6 billion campaign that raised $2.1 billion from more than 128,000 donors.\n\nNC State University Provost Warwick Arden said in a statement, \"Randy Woodson has been an exceptional chancellor for NC State. During his leadership, NC State has increased significantly in student graduation rates, extramural grant activity and research, and development activity with completion of a very successful campaign and dramatic growth of the endowment. Our national rankings have soared resulting in greater national visibility and greatly increased student applications, at both the undergraduate and graduate level. This of course has been achieved by a dedicated team of individuals but Randy appointed many of them and has led the way. After working with Randy for 14 years I can tell you he is a person of great integrity, intelligence and vision. He is passionate about the role of higher education and especially about the success of NC State.

This past year, however, has been marred by controversy surrounding Poe Hall -- a building on campus in which a suspected cancer cluster related to PCB contamination -- and what some have argued was the university's inadequate response to protect staff and students.", "source": {"uri": "ncnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NC Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_schofield@ncnewsline.com", "name": "Rob Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hans", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Hans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Woodson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Randy Woodson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Central University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC-State-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745190", "eventUri": "eng-9745190", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

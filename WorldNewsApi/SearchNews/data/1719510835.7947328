The American player, a two-time tour winner, withdrew from a competition in Texas with two holes remaining of his second round on Friday citing an illness, a day before he died. In their statement, Eric and Terry Murray said \"life wasn't always easy\" for their son and \"although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now\". The couple said that losing him was a \"nightmare\" and they have \"so many questions that have no answers... but one\". \"Was Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and - it seems - by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed.\" The pair thanked the PGA Tour and \"the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support\". They ended their statement by saying: \"Please honour Grayson by being kind to one another. If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else.\" Murray pulled out of the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday and his death on Saturday was announced by PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan, who said Murray's parents had asked for the event to continue. 'I wanted to give up on life at times' Murray spoke in January about his battles with anxiety and depression and revealed he had sought treatment in the past few years for alcohol abuse but had been sober for several months. Following his tour victory at the start of this year in Hawaii, he explained how much the win meant to him after what he had been through, saying: \"It's not easy... I wanted to give up a lot of times, give up on myself, give up on the game of golf, give up on life at times, and you just persevere. \"When you get tired of fighting, let someone else fight for you and that's what happened.\" Golfers pay tribute to Murray World number one Scottie Scheffler led the tributes to him. The American golfer said: \"Obviously, the news hasn't really sunk in quite yet, but I'm thinking about his family and praying hard for all of them. \"I can't imagine how difficult of a time this is. I got to know Grayson a bit better over the last six months or so. There's not really a way to put into words how sad and tragic it is, but I'm thinking about his family.\" Murray's long-time caddie Jay Green hailed him as \"the absolute best\". \"Not only was he an incredible, thoughtful and generous boss, he was an even better friend,\" he said in a statement. \"He truly would do anything for anyone. He has the best family and my heart goes out to them. We will all miss him deeply.\" English golfer Luke Donald wrote on X: \"Truly devastating news that Grayson Murray has passed away. He asked me for some advice on how to play Augusta a few months ago, last week I saw him at the PGA Championship, life truly is precious. My condolences and prayers to his whole family that they may find some peace.\" Donald's fellow countryman Justin Rose wrote: \"I had the opportunity to spend a few rounds of golf alongside Grayson in recent weeks at Hilton Head, Quail Hollow and Valhalla. \"I will always remember that and use it to remind myself that you never know what challenges people have going on in their lives and how they may be internalising things. RIP Grayson and love and strength to your family and friends.\" PGA Tour boss Jay Monahan said: \"Over the last several years I spent a lot of time with him because I wanted to understand what we could do, in his opinion, to help everybody else out here. \"I'm devastated by Grayson's loss. The conversations I had with him, particularly the last year, I learned an awful lot from him. He was very open and transparent with me.\" Murray won the Sony Open in Hawaii in January after sinking a 40ft birdie putt to beat Byeong Hun An and Keegan Bradley in a playoff. It marked his first tour victory since clinching his maiden PGA Tour title during his 2017 rookie campaign, when he won the Barbasol Championship in Alabama aged 24.

{"id": 225036460, "title": "SNP will not back parliament ban for Michael Matheson over \u00a311,000 iPad data roaming bill", "text": "The SNP will not support a Holyrood ban for Michael Matheson over an \u00a311,000 bill he racked up on his parliamentary iPad. MSPs will decide on Wednesday if they agree with the Standards Committee recommendation that the former health secretary should be barred from Holyrood for 27 sitting days and lose his salary for 54. If the motion carries, it would be the longest suspension and biggest fine ever handed down to an MSP. Matheson, who quit the cabinet in February, was found to have breached the code of conduct for MSPs by racking up the huge roaming bill while on holiday in Morocco, which later he said was caused by his children watching football. Initially, the Falkirk West MSP had attempted to use a combination of his office costs and expenses to cover the bill, but he later said he would pay it himself after the issue was made public. Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem and Scottish Green MSPs are expected to back the motion calling for sanctions to be imposed on Matheson. First Minister John Swinney previously said he would not back sanctions against Matheson. The SNP then lodged an amendment that outlines concerns about the complaints process but ultimately accepts the standards committee\u2019s recommendations. STV News understands SNP MSPs will vote in favour of their amendment but will abstain on the actual motion \u2013 even if it is amended. Swinney told Sky News on a General Election campaign visit on Wednesday: \u201cI never at any stage suggested that I would bring forward an alternative proposition. What I expressed was concerns about a process which I think brings Parliament into disrepute. \u201cIn no other walk of life would it be tolerable for somebody on a disciplinary panel to prejudge a case. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t be allowed in any other walk of life, and I think the Scottish Parliament has got itself into a really tricky situation by doing that. \u201cParliament will sort these things out and it will decide its position and obviously I\u2019ll accept what Parliament decides.\u201d Following the Holyrood debate and vote on the committee\u2019s recommended sanctions, the Tories will then force a vote on Matheson\u2019s future, calling for him to resign. It is unlikely the motion will pass, however, with the Scottish Greens not expected to support it and party MSP Ross Greer describing it as \u201ccynical\u201d. Speaking ahead of the debate, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said: \u201cPublic trust in MSPs is on the line in today\u2019s vote \u2013 and it will be destroyed if SNP and Greens MSPs do a dodgy deal to save Michael Matheson\u2019s skin. \u201cMichael Matheson outrageously billed the taxpayer \u00a311,000 for roaming charges he racked up while on holiday. He then repeatedly misled the public and Parliament to cover his tracks and only paid back the money when he was rumbled. \u201cMichael Matheson would have been sacked in any other walk of life for what he did. That is why opinion polls show the vast majority believe he has to go. \u201cThe public will be incandescent with rage with every MSP who fails to back this motion because those politicians will effectively be saying, \u2018normal rules don\u2019t apply to us \u2013 we\u2019re better than you\u2019. \u201cMSPs must vote for our motion to tell Michael Matheson he must finally do the decent thing and quit.\u201d Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar accused the SNP of \u201cputting their party interests before the good of the country\u201d. He added: \u201cJohn Swinney and the SNP are using the Boris Johnson and Conservative Party playbook \u2013 putting personal relationships before the integrity of Parliament. \u201cJohn Swinney is trying to defend the indefensible by backing Matheson, who was found to have attempted to misuse \u00a311,000 of public money. \u201cIt\u2019s completely and utterly unacceptable.\u201d He said Labour is \u201cdedicated to cleaning up politics\u201d, including by introducing a Bill that would include a recall process to sack suspended MSPs. A spokesman for the SNP Holyrood group said: \u201cThe procedures of the Parliament must be beyond reproach \u2013 not open to bias, prejudice and political motivation. \u201cThere is a need for a review of the complaints process to restore integrity and confidence in the Parliament and its procedures to ensure we are never again in a position where politics is put before process and prejudice is put before Parliament.\u201d", "summary": "Former health secretary faces a record ban from Holyrood over an \u00a311,000 bill racked up on his parliamentary iPad while on holiday.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/politics/snp-will-not-back-parliament-ban-for-michael-matheson-over-11000-ipad-data-roaming-bill", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cfbadc68977d794daf1985563159c22e-1716469915.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:35:47", "author": "Kevin Scott", "authors": ["Kevin Scott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": -0.466}

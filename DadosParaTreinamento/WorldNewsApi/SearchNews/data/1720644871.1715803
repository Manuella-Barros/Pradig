Her mother is American and her father was born and raised in London. Dewey's parents lived between London and the U.S. before eventually settling in New Jersey, where she grew up. She and her sisters would regularly fly to England's capital during school breaks and summer vacation to visit their grandmother, who still lives there. In 2022, the 25-year-old and her fianc\u00e9, Harrison Kent, had been living in Philadelphia for two years. \"We wanted to be a little closer to our families but I had always told him, 'whenever you want to move to London, I'm down,'\" the graphic designer tells CNBC Make It. \"He had only been once before.\" Around the time of this conversation, Kent began researching schools to get his master's in furniture design. In November 2022 he was accepted to his dream master's program, the Kingston University Masters of Product & Furniture Design, in London, and the couple decided to cross the pond. \"It was one of those things that we knew if we don't do it now we were never going to do it,\" Dewey says. \"It's such a privilege to have multiple passports and I didn't want my 20s to be over and never have actually lived in the U.K. full time.\"", "summary": "Maisy Dewey and Harrison Kent live on the houseboat in London with their dog too.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/08/couple-london-houseboat-unlocked.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107425973-1717784055588-IMG_3858.jpeg?v=1717784072", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:59:19", "author": "Celia Fernandez", "authors": ["Celia Fernandez"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.436}

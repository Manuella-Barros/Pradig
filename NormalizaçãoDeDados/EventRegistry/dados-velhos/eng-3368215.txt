Dealers don't know everything the company is planning, Hackett said in a brief interview with The Associated Press. \"We think dealers are really going to be happy with the vehicles we've got coming this year and what we've got in the hopper,\" he said, without giving specifics.\n\nFord's U.S. sales were down 4 percent through July and its market share has slipped 0.3 percentage points, causing investors and dealers to worry about the company's product decisions. While Ford's top-seller, the F-Series pickup, was recently updated with a new aluminum body, other important bread-and-butter products such as the Fusion sedan and Escape SUV have grown dated. Ford has lagged rivals in long-range electric cars, and while subcompact SUV sales are booming, Ford doesn't plan to roll out an entry in that market until next year.\n\nSuccessful CEOs always have to prepare for the future and take care of the present, Hackett said from the San Francisco area, where he was to attend a Ford symposium Thursday on helping cities handle increasing traffic with technology and better transportation options.\n\nAlthough people in cities have more transport choices such as ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft, Hackett predicted that personal car ownership will survive. People already own vehicles and prefer to drive them knowing that they aren't used 90 percent of the time, Hackett said. \"I'm not ready to admit that Ford is facing a world where it's losing a lot of personal buyers,\" he said. \"But I would admit that they're going to have a lot more options.\"\n\nIn September, Ford bought Chariot, app-based shuttle service that originally operated 100 14-passenger vans in the San Francisco area. Since then it's tripled the fleet and expanded to New York, Seattle and Austin, Texas. The company also is investing $1 billion in a budding robotics startup, Argo AI, to acquire more expertise for autonomous vehicles.\n\nHackett said spending on the future is small compared with how much Ford spends on car and truck development.\n\nHe said Ford has to be at the forefront of helping cities deal with increased congestion from growing populations and increased package deliveries as vehicles fight over scarce curb space for parking. \"All these things point to the need to harmonize and choreograph transportation,\" he said.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Ford invested $1 billion in robotics startup Argo AI and did not purchase the company.\n\nBusiness Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nMake it your business.

Dealers don't know everything the company is planning, Hackett said in a brief interview with The Associated Press. \"We think dealers are really going to be happy with the vehicles we've got coming this year and what we've got in the hopper,\" he said, without giving specifics.\n\nFord's U.S. sales were down 4 percent through July and its market share has slipped 0.3 percentage points, causing investors and dealers to worry about the company's product decisions. While Ford's top-seller, the F-Series pickup, was recently updated with a new aluminum body, other important bread-and-butter products such as the Fusion sedan and Escape SUV have grown dated. Ford has lagged rivals in long-range electric cars, and while subcompact SUV sales are booming, Ford doesn't plan to roll out an entry in that market until next year.\n\nSuccessful CEOs always have to prepare for the future and take care of the present, Hackett said from the San Francisco area, where he was to attend a Ford symposium Thursday on helping cities handle increasing traffic with technology and better transportation options.\n\nAlthough people in cities have more transport choices such as ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft, Hackett predicted that personal car ownership will survive. People already own vehicles and prefer to drive them knowing that they aren't used 90 percent of the time, Hackett said. \"I'm not ready to admit that Ford is facing a world where it's losing a lot of personal buyers,\" he said. \"But I would admit that they're going to have a lot more options.\"\n\nIn September, Ford bought Chariot, an app-based shuttle service that originally operated 100 14-passenger vans in the San Francisco area. Since then it's tripled the fleet and expanded to New York, Seattle and Austin, Texas. The company also is investing $1 billion in a budding robotics startup, Argo AI, to acquire more expertise for autonomous vehicles.\n\nHackett said spending on the future is small compared with how much Ford spends on car and truck development.\n\nHe said Ford has to be at the forefront of helping cities deal with increased congestion from growing populations and increased package deliveries as vehicles fight over scarce curb space for parking. \"All these things point to the need to harmonize and choreograph transportation,\" he said.\n\n____\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that Ford invested $1 billion in robotics startup Argo AI and did not purchase the company.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label":

That will mean changing how cities look. For a Ford now under the leadership of new CEO Jim Hackett, it means changing some of the company's goals beyond selling cars, too.\n\n\"I love this about my status as CEO in a family company, because they can take a very long view,\" Hackett said.\n\nThe conversations ranged, though a common theme emerged: City streets are crowded by too many single-passenger cars, and streets need to be made much safer for all forms of transportation.\n\nGenerally, multiple panelists said, roads with fewer cars are better in a multitude of ways.\n\nHackett and Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford want to fix that problem.\n\nChange will be driven by autonomous vehicles, but carmakers are going to have to think a lot harder about goals for those vehicles as self-imposed deadlines approach, according to Janette Sadik-Khan, principal of transportation for Bloomberg Associates. And Ford, which has pledged a self-driving vehicle without a steering wheel or accelerator or brake pedals by 2021, is leading a push that could result in fewer vehicles on the road.\n\n\"I don't believe there's going to be a big degradation of sales as the cities become less congested,\" Hackett said. \"It's probably going to give people more options to keep their cars, because they can choose to use them in ways that they couldn't before.\"\n\nFord leadership has used its City of Tomorrow concept in the past to outline how the company thinks cities of the future will move.\n\nUnder the leadership of Hackett, the conversation at the event Thursday took on a more literal tone. The leader brought in to change the company opened the day-long event inside a Fort Mason warehouse on the San Francisco Bay with a simple observation.\n\n\"Technology is magic,\" Hackett said, but it needs to be applied in an intelligent, thought-out way.\n\nRather than displaying colorful artist renderings with flying vehicles, or rolling out futuristic concept machines, talks Thursday focused on how to bring things like autonomous vehicles, ride-hailing systems and bike-sharing to densely populated areas, and how private companies can work with municipalities to implement a real transportation ecosystem.\n\nFor Ford, it made public the conversations that typically happened behind closed doors.\n\n\"What they're doing here demonstrates that they seem to be getting more serious about trying to execute,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, analyst with Navigant Research.\n\nLeading a fireside chat with Hackett, Alex McDowell, director of the University of Southern California World Building Institute, commented that the San Francisco event was the first Ford event that wasn't filled with middle-aged men in sports coats.\n\nHackett used the half-hour time slot to touch on his \"human-centric\" design process, which he's weaving into company dialogue.\n\nIt's all meant to get to the root of how humans can interact with a product in a way that will enrich their lives.\n\n\"We have a chance to offer (new technology) in a way that humans get the advantage,\" Hackett said. \"All I want to get across ... I am for this new technology, because it can do a lot of things that humans can't do today.\"\n\nHackett added that continuing dialogue through public talks and symposiums will continue to push Ford and other companies toward the best implementations of new products. That's something informing his assessment of the company's autonomous programs, for example.\n\nHackett's predecessor, Mark Fields, made the original promise of self-driving cars for ride-sharing programs by 2021. On Thursday, Hackett said the technology will be ready to launch by then, but it might come in a different form than ride-sharing, based on what Ford determines to be best to meet market needs.\n\n\"The tension is the evolution of the technology is progressing really well,\" he said. \"The markets will develop independently. ... I want choices.\"\n\nithibodeau@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @Ian_Thibodeau\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2uVgIVv", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 100, "id": 550, "label": "dmoz/Society/Future"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229192"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303305", "label": {"eng": "Traffic congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303314", "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303817", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304057", "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304492", "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307172", "label": {"eng": "Steering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313243", "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319951", "label": {"eng": "Autonomous car"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay"}, "type": "loc", "id": "325005"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "349858", "label": {"eng": "Fireside chats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigant_Consulting", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "394377", "label": {"eng": "Navigant Consulting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Mason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "444259", "label": {"eng": "Fort Mason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clay_Ford,_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "554482", "label": {"eng": "William Clay Ford, Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janette_Sadik-Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "622973", "label": {"eng": "Janette Sadik-Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "651715", "label": {"eng": "Mark Fields (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_McDowell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "1137168", "label": {"eng": "Alex McDowell"}}]}

Fields' replacement, Jim Hackett, is spending his first 100 days trying to assess his shop and get a grasp on where he wants to take it. While Ford may be behind competitors in the race to develop robotcars, Hackett showed a willingness to be realistic about the fledgling technology.\n\nAhead of a Ford symposium in San Francisco this week, Hackett spoke with the San Francisco Chronicle about autonomous cars. His view toward the adoption of the technology jibes with what carmakers have quietly said in the past, but seeing Hackett publicly embrace the idea that there should be tempered expectations about self-driving cars is a breath of fresh air.\n\nHere's one response he gave to a question about whether there'll still be a place for human-driven cars down the line:\n\n[Chronicle]: So do you think we'll shift entirely to autonomous vehicles, or will there still be a place for the car that you buy and drive yourself?\n\n[Hackett]: It's the latter. We don't know that autonomous vehicle intelligence in the future will all be delegated to a service that no one owns but everyone uses. It could play a role in vehicles that people own, vehicles that aren't supposed to crash. You're buying the capability because of the protection it gives you. It's also possible it could be applied in these big, disruptive ways that of course we're not blind to, but my bet is we don't know. So again, that's a good position for Ford to be in, because the company can actually advantage itself both ways. Compared to -- I don't want to name anyone, but a tech company that's not in the vehicle business -- they hope it will only go one way, right? Today, 60-70 days into my job, I just want to make sure the possibility isn't closed.\n\nThere was this bit, too, about people handling the wheel:\n\nQ: Ford has invested in self-driving cars, with Argo AI. You've invested in ride services, with Chariot. Why can't we just keep driving our own cars?\n\nA: They're actually together, for me. Vehicles are getting smarter, in the traditional business. And with the promise of the future business -- autonomy -- the vehicles are going to get much smarter. That guarantees, in a way, that Ford's vehicle history is an advantage. Because the smarter the vehicles are in the future -- and we can build them -- the more they'll have a role. I think dumb things are going to have a hard time in that out-there future. Things that have no intelligence, it's going to be harder to understand why you need them.\n\nFord has said it plans to roll out a highly-automated car by 2021, likely to be used in a ride-hailing setting. This seems like an achievable goal. Carve out a section of a downtown core, and have a taxi-like service operate in a capacity that can show people how the technology works. You could probably win over some skeptics that way, while continuously trying to perfect the technology.\n\nHackett has a clear-eyed approach, not a shoot-from-the-hip view that could lead people to think fully-autonomous cars will be offered for sale in the next few of years. It's cautious, but in an environment where pushing out the tech and developing it as fast as possible seems to be the official line of everyone in the industry right now, it's nice to see Hackett take this line. The rollout of self-driving cars across the U.S. will take time; it's good Hackett is taking this approach.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229192"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303588", "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303773", "label": {"eng": "Wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303817", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304132", "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306478", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308007", "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313243", "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315233", "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319951", "label": {"eng": "Autonomous car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "346057", "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "359131", "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "651715", "label": {"eng": "Mark Fields (businessman)"}}]}

And so it was with wariness but also curiosity that I approached a first-time meeting Wednesday with Jim Hackett, the new CEO of Ford. He's also the former CEO of Steelcase (scs) and, in between those two posts, a Ford board member and head of the venerable automaker's \"smart mobility\" unit.\n\nWhat exactly, I wondered, does Ford (f) mean by mobility, a vague and overly broad term that makes me think of cell phones but might also pertain to movement among the social classes or a rehab patient's progress? It turns out, says Hackett, that Ford thinks of mobility as a \"catch-all\" phrase that encompasses all non-traditional businesses. In other words, anything that doesn't involve popping an internal-combustion engine into a vehicle and selling it, is a potential mobility product.\n\nMobility is sexy, but it doesn't account for much of Ford's revenue. And although Hackett's predecessor, Mark Fields, got the boot for not having a coherent strategy, Ford already has made a handful of non-traditional moves. It's a partner in a popular bike sharing program. And it operates Chariot, a \"micro-transit\" shuttle service in several U.S. cities.\n\nThis essay first appeared in Data Sheet, Fortune's tech newsletter. Subscribe here.\n\nHackett sees his mission as positioning Ford for the day when most people live in cities and may or may not need their own car. He's currently drafting a 100-day plan for Ford he plans to unveil in October. In the meantime, he says the company will consider a \"smorgasbord\" of options that involve moving people around. He hinted, for example, that Ford is looking closely at a \"metered parking\" business (a la startup SpotHero) and various \"curb management\" schemes.\n\nEverything is on the table, he says, including ride-hailing, though he professes to be uninterested in owning a piece of Uber or Lyft. Right now Ford supplies those companies' drivers, notes Hackett. If Ford were to own the service, \"they'll want a discount, and I don't want to destroy our margins.\"\n\nNot destroying margins in the challenged car business is neither a vague nor overly broad goal, provided a detailed strategy follows.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302735", "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303012", "label": {"eng": "Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303239", "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303817", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304292", "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305851", "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310794", "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310944", "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimride#Lyft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "313244", "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "313247", "label": {"eng": "Uber (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "319945", "label": {"eng": "Chrysler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "338343", "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_meter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "390397", "label": {"eng": "Parking meter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelcase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "491740", "label": {"eng": "Steelcase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "651715", "label": {"eng": "Mark Fields (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1269491", "label": {"eng": "Bicycle-sharing system"}}]}

So again, that's a good position for Ford to be in, because the company can actually advantage itself both ways.\"\n\nHackett added in a separate interview with The Wall Street Journal that he doesn't believe the autonomous vehicle will \"just replace the station wagon.\". \"The AV will replace and do something that the station wagon can't do -- not just drive itself -- but other things,\" he said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 657, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Automobiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "wgt": 100, "id": 1206, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302531", "label": {"eng": "Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302854", "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302990", "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303318", "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303817", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304234", "label": {"eng": "Mass media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306478", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306512", "label": {"eng": "Mind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307067", "label": {"eng": "Manufacturing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307528", "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307628", "label": {"eng": "Leadership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "307951", "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313243", "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315233", "label": {"eng": "Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319110", "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319951", "label": {"eng": "Autonomous car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "335800", "label": {"eng": "Market sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "338343", "label": {"eng": "Fortune (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "346057", "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "651715", "label": {"eng": "Mark Fields (businessman)"}}]}

And so it was with wariness but also curiosity that I approached a first-time meeting Wednesday with Jim Hackett, the new CEO of Ford. He's also the former CEO of Steelcase and, in between those two posts, a Ford board member and head of the venerable automaker's \"smart mobility\" unit.\n\nWhat exactly, I wondered, does Ford mean by mobility, a vague and overly broad term that makes me think of cell phones but might also pertain to movement among the social classes or a rehab patient's progress? It turns out, says Hackett, that Ford thinks of mobility as a \"catch-all\" phrase that encompasses all non-traditional businesses. In other words, anything that doesn't involve popping an internal-combustion engine into a vehicle and selling it, is a potential mobility product.\n\nMobility is sexy, but it doesn't account for much of Ford's revenue. And although Hackett's predecessor, Mark Fields, got the boot for not having a coherent strategy, Ford already has made a handful of non-traditional moves. It's a partner in a popular bike sharing program. And it operates Chariot, a \"micro-transit\" shuttle service in several U.S. cities.\n\nHackett sees his mission as positioning Ford for the day when most people live in cities and may or may not need their own car. He's currently drafting a 100-day plan for Ford he plans to unveil in October. In the meantime, he says the company will consider a \"smorgasbord\" of options that involve moving people around. He hinted, for example, that Ford is looking closely at a \"metered parking\" business (a la startup SpotHero) and various \"curb management\" schemes.\n\nEverything is on the table, he says, including ride-hailing, though he professes to be uninterested in owning a piece of Uber or Lyft. Right now Ford supplies those companies' drivers, notes Hackett. If Ford were to own the service, \"they'll want a discount, and I don't want to destroy our margins.\"\n\nNot destroying margins in the challenged car business is neither a vague nor overly broad goal, provided a detailed strategy follows.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "wgt": 100, "id": 571, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "wgt": 100, "id": 572, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302735", "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303012", "label": {"eng": "Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303239", "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303817", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304292", "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305851", "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310794", "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310944", "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimride#Lyft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "313244", "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "313247", "label": {"eng": "Uber (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "319945", "label": {"eng": "Chrysler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_meter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "390397", "label": {"eng": "Parking meter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelcase", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "491740", "label": {"eng": "Steelcase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fields_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "651715", "label": {"eng": "Mark Fields (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1269491", "label": {"eng": "Bicycle-sharing system"}}]}

And help shape it.\n\nIn May, Ford tapped Hackett as the storied company's new CEO. The former top executive of the Steelcase office furniture business, Hackett joined Ford's board of directors in 2013 and last year became chairman of Ford Smart Mobility, a subsidiary focused on new business models that don't revolve solely around building and selling cars. Ford Smart Mobility purchased San Francisco shuttle service Chariot in September, pointing to at least one of the ideas Ford was willing to pursue. Ford also will invest $1 billion over the next five years in Argo AI, a self-driving startup.\n\nOn Thursday, Ford is sponsoring the \"City of Tomorrow\" symposium at San Francisco's Fort Mason, focused on how new modes of transportation could mold the growth of cities, and vice-versa. The Chronicle spoke with Hackett, 62, about how a century-old automaker can thrive in a world of robot taxis. The interview has been edited for space and clarity.\n\nQ: You are a relative newcomer to Ford, a 114-year-old company. And for 114 years, the company has basically focused on one mission: building cars that people will buy and drive themselves. Is it difficult to get people within such an established company to start planning for such radical changes in the business?\n\nA: It is a challenge to get people to see themselves in a movie and not in a Polaroid. The notion of the Polaroid is a picture of our business as we know it today: the models, the products. Everything that we produce successfully is really in a movie, moving in this direction.\n\nWhat's an example? The Chariot acquisition. It had 12 people when we bought it, it's over 100 today. And we're evolving the inside of the Ford Transit van because of what we've learned about the way people actually ride. Because we're now using it for ride-sharing, we've actually learned more about what people really care about. Isn't that great? Both sides really advantaged themselves: the core business and the emerging business. Those little success stories open the eyes of the all the people for the potential of other plays like this.\n\nQ: Ford has invested in self-driving cars, with Argo AI. You've invested in ride services, with Chariot. Why can't we just keep driving our own cars?\n\nA: They're actually together, for me. Vehicles are getting smarter, in the traditional business. And with the promise of the future business -- autonomy -- the vehicles are going to get much smarter. That guarantees, in a way, that Ford's vehicle history is an advantage. Because the smarter the vehicles are in the future -- and we can build them -- the more they'll have a role. I think dumb things are going to have a hard time in that out-there future. Things that have no intelligence, it's going to be harder to understand why you need them.\n\nQ: So do you think we'll shift entirely to autonomous vehicles, or will there still be a place for the car that you buy and drive yourself?\n\nA: It's the latter. We don't know that autonomous vehicle intelligence in the future will all be delegated to a service that no one owns but everyone uses. It could play a role in vehicles that people own, vehicles that aren't supposed to crash. You're buying the capability because of the protection it gives you. It's also possible it could be applied in these big, disruptive ways that of course we're not blind to, but my bet is we don't know. So again, that's a good position for Ford to be in, because the company can actually advantage itself both ways. Compared to -- I don't want to name anyone, but a tech company that's not in the vehicle business -- they hope it will only go one way, right? Today, 60-70 days into my job, I just want to make sure the possibility isn't closed.\n\nQ: If we do shift to a future of shared fleets of self-driving cars, wouldn't that mean fewer car sales for Ford and the auto industry?\n\nA: I'm open to the possibility that the line could bend that way. Then the company's defense is not only its investment in new possible models, but also its fitness. How fit is it in delivering the old model?\n\nBut again, I'm really optimistic that the threat is not going to be that there's not enough vehicle revenue. If I'm right about the smartness, there's all this other revenue that we could get, because we may have just south of 100 million people in our products at any time, and we're not really earning substantial revenue from them today.\n\nImagine a vehicle's going by some sort of a retail thing that takes standing in line for. The vehicle is mediating \"Do I want to stay in line for whatever thing is in that retailer: coffee, a drive-through,\" and arbitrating whether I go there or I go to the next destination on my path. There are fees for Ford helping that. There's an advantage to the retailer because now there's higher utilization. And the car occupant gets an advantage of not waiting in line. So everyone wins in that model. That's an example of the fees that come from the 100 million users that we haven't mined at all.\n\nQ: Your predecessor committed the company to getting self-driving taxis out there by 2021. Is the company still committed to that vision, and is it doable?\n\nA: The answer is, we are going to be in the market with products in that timeframe. But the nature of the romanticism by everybody in the media about how this robot works is overextended right now. It will be a progressive thing, just like computing. If you think about a vehicle that can drive anywhere, anytime, in any circumstance, cold, rain -- that's longer than 2021. And every manufacturer will tell you that.\n\nTen years ago, it was about thinking of the vehicle having this independence. I think it'll be a co-dependent model in the future. Co-dependence will actually create a safe envelope for the vehicles.\n\nQ: You mean the infrastructure talking to the vehicles? Roads communicating with cars?\n\nA: There's never been a transportation system ever that didn't have some kind of co-dependence. Like maps in cars, or air traffic control with airplanes. Even the most advanced military drones are still using low-earth-orbit satellites.\n\nQ: You have a reputation of working quite well with Silicon Valley companies, and Silicon Valley companies often have a high opinion of themselves. Are there lessons Detroit could bring to Silicon Valley, things the Valley could learn from Ford?\n\nA: I have a tremendous respect for the way entrepreneurs here answer what has become a design framing question, \"How might we?\" They start with the affirmation that it's possible. Detroit can learn from that.\n\nOn the other hand, mechanical engineering in these systems called vehicles is as difficult as anything that was ever done in electrical engineering or software. It's actually a parallel science that they can learn from us. To build something at the scale the auto industry builds is mind boggling, so that scale and capability could help Silicon Valley.\n\nI had three new employees today in meetings. I always ask \"Where'd you come from?\" and it was the usual suspects here: Facebook, Google, Apple. They're coming to work for Ford. My friend David Kelly who founded (design firm) IDEO says it's because this is the hottest problem in the tech world, the future of the vehicle.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 657, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Automobiles"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "type": "loc", "id": "210760"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "type": "loc", "id": "229192"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302735", "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302814", "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302870", "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302990", "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303009", "label": {"eng": "Transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303318", "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303379", "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303387", "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303588", "label": {"eng": "Taxicab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303817", "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303871", "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304132", "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304163", "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304413", "label": {"eng": "Design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305842", "label": {"eng": "Chairman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305851", "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "390784", "label": {"eng": "Polaroid Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelcase", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "491740", "label": {"eng": "Steelcase"}}]}

We had a very profitable ride.\n\nBut since those highs, and despite good profits over the last couple of years, Ford has slowly fallen out of favor with investors.\n\nNow, with Ford shares trading at less than seven times the company's expected 2017 earnings, it seems like a good time to ask: Is Ford stock a buy, a sell, or a hold?\n\nLet's take a closer look.\n\nThere are two common bearish narratives for Ford stock: that Ford is at risk of disruption from new high-tech market entrants and new business models, and that the all-important U.S. new-vehicle market appears to be past its cyclical peak, putting Ford's margins at risk.\n\nInvestors' ongoing fascination with Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) dramatic growth story has seemingly cast a shadow over Ford (and other big automakers). At the extreme, the bullish investment case for Tesla stock assumes that it will become the largest and most profitable company in the history of humanity. How could Ford stock compete with that?\n\nThere are genuine concerns beyond the Tesla hype. Quite a few analysts think the world is moving toward \"transportation as a service,\" in which many of us will choose to give up car ownership in favor of mobility services using self-driving electric taxis. If so, given that the technology that will enable such services is probably only a few years away, where will Ford find profit growth -- if it even survives?\n\nA related concern that's less bearish but still bearish: Even assuming that Ford can retool its business and product line to thrive in such a world, how much will it have to spend over the next few years to get there?\n\nThere's no question that this one is for real. The U.S. new-car market is clearly softening. As it softens further, increasing pricing pressure and declining sales will eat into Ford's profit margins.\n\nGiven that Ford generated 61% of its revenue in North America last year, with a 9.7% operating margin in the region, you can see the concern. As that gets squeezed, so will Ford's bottom line.\n\nDespite the bearish concerns, Ford stock has some big things going for it as an investment, even now.\n\nThe market may be sluggish, and possibly even headed for a decline before too long. But there's good news, too, in that consumer trends in the U.S., Europe, and China all favor Ford's most profitable products: trucks, commercial vehicles, and SUVs. That means Ford's profits are still strong: Ford earned $10.4 billion before taxes in 2016, and expects to earn close to $9 billion on that basis in 2017, despite the slipping market, higher commodity costs, and increased investments in future technologies.\n\nFord isn't flinching from the possibility of a slowdown in new-vehicle sales. Unlike some rivals, notably General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford's U.S. inventories are in great shape, meaning that it won't have to discount deeply to clear out unwanted vehicles. Ford has shown repeatedly that it can quickly adjust its production to meet demand as it falls (or rises, for that matter).\n\nIt's also important to note that Ford has a hefty $28.4 billion cash reserve to sustain new-product development even if its profits disappear during a downturn. That was a key factor in Ford's success in the first couple of years after the last recession: It had fresh products available while its rivals were still scrambling to recover.\n\nWhile the disruption concerns are real at an industrywide level, Ford's doing just fine with the future tech: It has a strong self-driving research and development program, a big commitment to electric drivetrains, and a subsidiary that is putting together a series of compelling mobility-related offerings for cities. Ford also sees ways to leverage its decades of commercial-fleet expertise in the new mobility-enabled world, as a provider of fleet management services to operators of automated ride-haling and car-sharing fleets. (That has the potential to be a very lucrative business.)\n\nThere's no doubt that some automakers will be left behind as technology changes the way we get around, but Ford is better prepared than most.\n\nFord's board has shown that it isn't afraid to shake things up to keep the company on course. Ford has a new CEO, Jim Hackett, who has experience in tech-savvy corporate transformations (and who led Ford's mobility subsidiary before taking the top job.) Hackett has said that his mission is to sharpen Ford's execution, speed decision-making, and ensure that Ford can thrive in that future world of tech-enabled mobility. He has a good team behind him: Most of Ford's senior executives are veterans of the turnaround who have proven themselves in the years since.\n\nThe low valuation of Ford stock means that its dividend is yielding a fat 5.5% at the moment. And that dividend is sustainable, thanks to that hefty cash reserve. Ford expects to keep paying the dividend to shareholders through a downturn, at least as long as its cash reserve holds out. (Ford has a substantial credit line to draw on if it runs out of cash, but that credit line won't be used to fund the dividend.)\n\nTo sum up, there are real, substantial arguments both for and against an investment in Ford's stock now. An investor who buys here can reinvest that hefty dividend to dollar-cost average through any downturn, getting paid to be patient while Hackett and his team, backed by a strong balance sheet, work to complete the transformation of Ford and its businesses.\n\nBut as we've seen, an investment in Ford stock isn't without risk. The market for new cars (and trucks, a super-important Ford profit center today) could transform and even shrink substantially over the next 10 to 15 years. And Ford's profits aren't likely to be growing in the near term: They'll almost certainly be down year over year in 2017, and Ford's bottom line will shrink further if (or rather, when) the U.S., Europe, or China enters a recession.\n\nLong story short: If you're attracted to the dividend and think Ford will prosper as the world changes, Ford stock could be a buy. But investors should tread carefully, as the risks are real.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Ford\n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

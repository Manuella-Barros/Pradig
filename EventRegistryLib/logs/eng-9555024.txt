On Thursday, Stormy Daniels, the woman whose non-disclosure agreement underlies the prosecution's claim that the former president wrongly classified payments made to his former attorney, Michael Cohen, as legal expenses, took to the stand for a second day of testimony.\n\nAfter Tuesday's testimony, the defense team moved for a mistrial, contending that Judge Juan Merchan allowed in testimony that was prejudicial and not probative. Merchan, while agreeing that there were \"some things that would have been better left unsaid,\" declined to grant the mistrial, and pointed out to the defense that they had a responsibility to raise timely objections.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBlame Game: Judge Merchan Tells Trump Defense They Should Have Objected More to Stormy Daniels' Testimony\n\nAfter several more hours of testimony from Daniels on Thursday, Trump's team again moved for a mistrial and were again shot down by the judge. After stating that he'd reviewed Tuesday's testimony and his prior rulings and was satisfied that they had not been violated, he asserted that Trump's attorneys \"opened the door\" to Daniels providing details regarding the purported encounter when they denied in their opening statement that any sex had taken place between Daniels and Trump.\n\nMerchan, echoing his denial Tuesday of the defense's initial mistrial motion, said Trump's lawyers had ample opportunities to object to questions that elicited what they say were damaging details about the alleged sexual encounter.\n\n\"There were many times, not once or twice, but many times when Ms. Necheles could've objected but didn't,\" the judge said.\n\nIn particular, the judge said, the defense should've objected to prosecutor Susan Hoffinger's question about whether Trump used a condom, which led to Daniels' response that he hadn't.\n\n\"I agree. That should never have come out. That question should never have been asked and that answer should never have been given,\" Merchan said. \"For the life of me, I don't know why Ms. Necheles didn't object.\"\n\nMerchan also rebuffed the defense's claim that Daniels' testimony so differed from her previous accounts of the alleged events as to warrant a mistrial. \"I disagree with your narrative that there's any new account here,\" the judge said.\n\nAs many do, I have serious reservations about the scope of the testimony Merchan is permitting in this trial. I'm not sitting right there in the courtroom, but based on what I can glean, he's been lax in his rulings on several evidentiary matters. That said, he's absolutely right about one thing: The defense has the responsibility to object to each and every question (or response) that they contend should not be allowed in -- and if they don't, they're waving that issue.\n\nNow, from a strategic standpoint, there are times when you forego an objection -- even if you might technically be correct -- because the particular question/testimony isn't particularly harmful, and you don't want to be seen by the jury (or judge) as obstructionist. You have to pick your battles and bear in mind that you're putting on a show for the jury, and you want them to have the impression that you know what you're doing and aren't just throwing stuff out there to see what sticks. (This is where I explain that trying cases is an art.)\n\nBut if there's a critical piece of testimony that should not come into evidence, it is incumbent upon you, the attorney, to make a proper objection on proper legal grounds. And if the judge overrules you, then the judge overrules you. You've made your record, and that issue gets added to the list of issues you'll be raising on appeal -- where an appellate court will review what's there on the record and the legal bases on which you raised your objections and determine if the trial court erred in allowing the evidence to come in. If you don't raise your objection, you don't have grounds for appeal. You're either building your case or deconstructing the opposition's, with precision, one legal brick at a time. (This is where I explain that trying cases is a science.)\n\nAgain, I'm not there in the courtroom -- without going through the transcript with a fine-toothed comb, it's difficult to know for certain how many times Necheles missed an objection she should have made. And there may already be ample evidence in the record that will ultimately support any conviction being overturned. But I'll tell you one thing: There was very little that I worried about more at trial than making sure I was making a proper record on appeal. For Trump's sake, he'd best hope his legal team is dotting i's and crossing t's on that front.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_moore@redstate.com", "name": "Susie Moore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-disclosure agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/e2f26ac3-6e3c-49f7-909b-91f2671c13b1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555024", "eventUri": "eng-9555024", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Defense attorneys had argued that Daniels told a different story on the witness stand than she in 2016.\n\nMerchan also repeated what he has maintained since his first mistrial denial on Tuesday: that defense attorneys could have objected to the questions prosecutors asked Daniels.\n\n\"For the life of me, I don't know why Ms. Necheles didn't object,\" the judge said.\n\nMerchan cited specific problems with the defense's arguments, saying that instead of denying the falsification of business records, they denied the sexual encounter with Daniels.\n\n\"That, in my mind, allows the people to do what they can to rehabilitate her and to corroborate her story,\" Merchan said. \"That pits your client's words against Ms. Daniels's word.\"\n\n\"Your motion for a mistrial is denied,\" Merchan concluded.\n\nBefore ruling on the mistrial request, Merchan rejected Trump's effort to narrow his gag order so he can speak publicly about Daniels now that she has finished her testimony in the trial.\n\nThe gag order on Trump limits any comments on witnesses and family members of prosecutors and the judge, forcing Trump to stop railing against some of his frequent targets online or face potential jail time. It doesn't bar him from attacking the judge or Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, an elected Democrat.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"He needs an opportunity to respond to the American people,\" Blanche said. \"She is no longer a witness.\"\n\nMerchan denied the motion to alter the gag order, saying, \"The reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks -- the vitriol.\"\n\nOn his way out of the courtroom, Trump told reporters, \"We are so innocent.\"\n\n\"Everybody saw what happened today. I don't think we have to do any expert explaining,\" Trump said. \"I'm not allowed to anyway because this judge is corrupt.\"\n\nTrump, who has been forced to appear for the trial for nearly four weeks so far, said he is missing valuable campaign time.\n\n\"I got to get back on the campaign trail. I'm not supposed to be here. We are so innocent,\" Trump added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe mistrial request and the gag order modification effort were part of three separate requests Trump attorneys said needed to be addressed before the end of the day.\n\nDefense attorneys also sought to limit the testimony of Playboy model Karen McDougal, though prosecutors voluntarily decided they would not call her to the stand for this trial.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

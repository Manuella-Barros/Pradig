{"id": 243232268, "title": "Liverpool transfer news: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia breaks his silence with Reds ready to strike deal", "text": "Euro 2024 has complicated the start of the summer transfer window for Liverpool, who may have to bide their time before approaching players. The tournament began on the same day the window opened \u2013 June 14 \u2013 and will run until July 14, making business harder to do for the elite players who will still be focused on their national team for the next few weeks. Nevertheless, Arne Slot is now in position as Reds boss and he is plotting the path ahead. As Mirror Football explained this week, it is expected to be a case of continuity, rather than revolution at Anfield, despite the change in regime. However, new sporting director Richard Hughes is always open to the possibility of signings \u2013 either as replacements for existing players, or if a bargain becomes available. With that in mind, here are the latest rumours from the world of Liverpool, involving both possible ins and outs. Kvaratskhelia breaks his silence Khvicha Kvaratskhelia says he will decide on his future after Euro 2024 because he is fully focused on Georgia\u2019s knockout game against Spain. Napoli star Kvaratskhelia scored in Georgia\u2019s remarkable win over Portugal which earned the lowest-ranked side in the competition a last-16 match against heavyweights Spain on Sunday evening. But away from the tournament there is much speculation about his future, with his agent and his father both offering their opinions on the subject. Liverpool are among the sides reportedly interested in his services, but Napoli have put their foot down, releasing a testy statement and now the 23-year-old winger has spoken out. \u201cI respect [new Napoli boss Antonio] Conte, he\u2019s one of the best managers,\u201d he said. \u201cI respect also Napoli, I love Napoli. I will decide my future after the Euros. Now I\u2019m focused on the game vs Spain.\u201d Juve move for Reds target Juventus are preparing to table a bid for Nice midfielder \u2013 and former Liverpool target \u2013 Khephren Thuram after agreeing an \u00a311million deal to sell striker Moise Kean to Fiorentina. Tuttosport reports that Juve are ready to reinvest the funds from Everton flop Kean's exit to sign 23-year-old Thuram, who's the brother of Inter forward Marcus. The France youth international has entered the final 12 months of his contract and Nice would be willing to sell. Thuram, who's also the son of French legend Lilian, was strongly linked with a move to Liverpool last summer as they searched for a deep-lying midfielder. He ended up staying put, but is now set to get his big move. Liverpool selling unknown defender Do you know the name Anderson Arroyo? Well, if you answered no, you\u2019re not alone, but he is a Liverpool player, albeit not for much longer. The Colombian defender joined the Reds in 2018, but hasn\u2019t made a single appearance for the club. He\u2019s been sent out on loan eight times, journeying to Spain, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Andorra. But that nomadic lifestyle is about to come to an end, with his most recent loan club, Burgos, set to sign him permanently. The Spanish second tier side, whose sporting director is former Swansea striker Michu, want to sign the 24-year-old. Liverpool will reportedly let him go for nothing, despite Arroyo being under contract for another year. Join our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

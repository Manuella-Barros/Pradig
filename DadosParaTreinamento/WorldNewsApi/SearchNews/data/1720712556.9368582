Fans are speculating that the actress, 36, will make an appearance in the anticipated superhero movie after spotting the arrival of what appears to be Lady Deadpool in a new teaser for the film that was released on Saturday, June 8. The clip depicts Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprising their respective titular characters as they team together to save the world from an existential threat. Around the 30-second mark, after Reynold\u2019s Deadpool says in a voiceover, \"I\u2019m about to lose everything that I\u2019ve ever cared about,\" a pair of legs are seen walking through an orange mist in a red and black Deadpool-esque suit. Many now believe the character could be Lady Deadpool, who is a female variant of Deadpool from an alternate universe. \"Willing to bet Blake Lively\u2019s playing Lady Deadpool. It would make perfect sense given that she\u2019s married to Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds,\" wrote one fan on social media. Lively and Reynolds have been married since 2012 and currently share four children together. Another eagle-eyed fan agreed about who could be playing the mysterious figure. \"My husband said based on the costume its lady Deadpool and he thinks it\u2019s Blake Lively!\" they wrote.

Two others shared their excitement, with one writing, \"It'll make absolutely ZERO sense if anyone other than #BlakeLively will play #LadyDeadpool,\" as another said that casting Lively as the character would be the \"best decision ever made in the history of decision making.\" Earlier this week, it was announced that the movie sequel has officially been rated R for \"strong bloody violence and language throughout, gore and sexual references.\" It is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to earn an R rating. The first two Deadpool movies, released in 2016 and 2018, received the same rating but were released by 20th Century Fox. In a May interview with PEOPLE, Reynolds and Jackman reflected on their 17-year friendship, with Reynolds comparing his relationship with Jackman to his marriage with the Gossip Girl actress. \"I think the secret sauce to a long-lasting Hollywood friendship is not too dissimilar to having a partner or a marriage,\" Reynolds said to Jackman. \"I am genuinely rooting for you, all the time. I want you to win. It\u2019s the same way I feel about Blake. As I'm rooting for her, I know she's rooting for me, and it's why we're so connected.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

The instantaneously iconic goal \u2013 United\u2019s opener in a 3-0 win at Goodison Park last year \u2013 was named the league\u2019s Goal of the Month back in November. Following the conclusion of the season, it then went up against the other eight \u2018Goal of the Month\u2019 winners from throughout the campaign \u2013 a shortlist that included three other United players. Bruno Fernandes was a contender due to his belting volley at Burnley (October), Kobbie Mainoo for his solo stunner at Wolves (February), and Marcus Rashford took March\u2019s prize for his booming long-ranger at Manchester City. But in the final reckoning, Garnacho reigned supreme. The Argentinian international has already been awarded the BBC\u2019s Goal of the Season accolade, and is surely favourite for the club\u2019s own equivalent prize, with results expected in the next few days. After the Everton game, the 19-year-old seemed astounded by what he had achieved. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, to be honest,\u201d he began. \u201cI just did [it] and I didn\u2019t see how I scored, I just listened around. \u201cI said: \u2018Oh, my God\u2019, and for me, of course, it was one of the best goals I have ever scored.\u201d The most acrobatic of strikes, it immediately drew comparisons with Wayne Rooney\u2019s timeless bicycle kick against Manchester City \u2013 arguably the greatest goal in the 32-year history of the Premier League. That\u2019s a topic for future debate, but Garnacho\u2019s glorious Goodison moment undeniably helped to kickstart a season of huge progression for the teenager. Alejandro appeared in all but two of United\u2019s Premier League games and scored in his 50th match of the 2023/24 campaign, our FA Cup final win over Man City on Saturday.", "summary": "Just one day after scoring at Wembley in the FA Cup final, Alejandro Garnacho has even more to celebrate as his otherworldly overhead kick against Everton has won yet another prize: the English Premier League&#8217;s Goal of the Season award for 2023/24.

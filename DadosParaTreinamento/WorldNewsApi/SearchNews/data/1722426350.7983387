German Ambassador Ute K\u00f6nig exchanged notes of the financing agreement with Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Simplex Chithyola- Banda and Minister of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare Jean Sendeza in Lilongwe yesterday. The ambassador said Germany, as a longstanding partner on social protection, has renewed the agreement with additional financing. \u201cThis funding is a testament to our enduring partnership with Malawi and our shared goal of fostering social equity and development,\u201d said K\u00f6nig. On his part, Chithyola-Banda said the country is facing various challenges that are aggravating poverty. \u201cThis additional funding will significantly bolster efforts to provide essential relief to the most vulnerable families in Malawi,\u201d he said. On her part, Sendeza said the new aspects of the programme include focus on gender equality to ensure that social development programmes are inclusive and equitable. She said: \u201cThis funding will empower women and girls, providing them with the support they need to thrive. \u201cThe Social Cash Transfer Programme, commonly known as Mtukula Pakhomo, provides critical support to vulnerable families in Malawi, enabling them to meet their basic needs and improve their quality of life.\u201d According to the minister, the programme\u2019s success is a result of collaborative efforts of the Malawi and German governments, along with other development partners. The social cash transfer is the country\u2019s main social safety net programme that targets the 10 percent ultra-poor of the country\u2019s population. However, with increasing vulnerabilities in rural communities, Sendeza said the beneficiaries will now be increased to 15 percent of the population. Germany has been supporting SCTP since 2009, reaching 92 000 households in the districts of Chitipa, Likoma, Mchinji, Salima, Machinga, Mangochi and Phalombe.", "summary": "<p>Malawi and Germany have signed a 19 million euros (about K35 billion) grant that will go towards the Social Cash Transfer Programme (SCTP) in seven targeted districts.

A similar gesture by Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in a regular season game in March drew a $100,000 fine from the league.\n\nMurray, who has been flummoxed by a strained left calf, a lost shooting touch and a paucity of whistles going his way, left Ball Arena without speaking to reporters after Games 1 and 2.\n\nHe met with the media after practice Wednesday but didn't have much to say about his actions that endangered players on both teams and Marc Davis' officiating crew or the fine issued by the league.\n\nREAD: NBA: Timberwolves blitz Nuggets for 2-0 lead\n\n\"Nah, I mean it is what it is and I take everything in full responsibility, so on to the next,\" Murray said when asked whether he had expected the fine and if he felt his punishment was appropriate.\n\nAsked for an explanation of his actions, Murray said, \"Yeah, on to the next. I mean, two days ago, not much for me to say about it right now.\"\n\nWhen asked about issuing an apology or taking responsibility, Murray cut off the line of questioning by asking, \"Do you have any basketball questions?\"\n\nMurray acknowledged the Nuggets lost their collective composure Monday night when the Wolves hounded them into a 35% shooting performance even though their best defender, Rudy Gobert, who won the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award on Tuesday, was back in Minneapolis for the birth of his son.\n\n\"We've just got to be ready to play and not get frustrated with how the game goes sometimes and we allowed it to take us out of our game,\" Murray said. \"So, we've just got to stay composed and find a way to stick together during the game and figure it out. No matter what the scoreboard says, we've got to be able to claw back.\"\n\nThe towel Murray threw landed at the heels of Davis on the baseline but the heat pack skidded across the floor just as Karl-Anthony Towns was going for a lay-up.\n\nWolves coach Chris Finch called Murray's actions \"inexcusable and dangerous,\" saying somebody easily could have gotten hurt.\n\n\"I've never seen that from Jamal. That was very uncharacteristic,\" Malone said, attributing Murray losing his cool to \"taking a charge and it's not called, not making shots at the level we know he's capable of making, being down 30 points to a team that we're trying to beat to get to the Western Conference finals.\n\n\"So when you put it all in the boiling pot, that's a lot to handle. And he didn't handle it the way he knows he needs to handle it, and I'm sure he told you guys that.\"\n\nComing off the first NBA championship in franchise history, the Nuggets have shown a fatigue in these playoffs that has plagued previous champions.\n\nUnlike last year when they coasted at the end of the regular season with the top seed in the West already secured, the second-seeded Nuggets jockeyed with Minnesota and Oklahoma City until the final weekend of the season.\n\nMurray missed 23 games this season with a variety of lower body injuries and the constant double teams that opponents threw at Nikola Jokic is evident in the scars on his upper arms.\n\nIt's not just health but slow starts that have plagued the reigning champs ever since the playoffs began.\n\nThey've trailed by large margins in all seven of their postseason games. They bounced back against the Lakers to win in five, with Murray hitting a pair of game-winning buckets.

Smith, who recently took to First Take to reveal his highly-anticipated opinion on the matter.\n\n\"I'm pretty pissed off at Jamal Murray,\" said Smith, per ClutchPoints on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter. \"...Entitled.

However, the 2024 NBA Playoffs haven't been as smooth sailing, particularly for Murray.\n\nWith the Nuggets staring at a second-round exit against a worthy opponent, the frustrations have started to boil over for the team, especially Murray. After Murray's ignorant response to his Game 2 antics, ESPN's Jarred Greenberg questioned his character amid a \"butt\" kicking, saying:\n\n\"You know when you find out what people are really made of? You don't find out what they're made of when they are sweeping a team that came in of the play-in in the Western Confernece finals (Lakers) ...

However, he produced mediocre performances apart from those decisive moments. His inconsistent run has carried over to the conference semis against the T'Wolves, where Murray has managed only 12.5 points across two games on 28.1% shooting.\n\nHis on-court antics are catching more heat amid this underwhelming run, and the Nuggets could be out soon if this persists.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arhaan_raje@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arhaan Raje", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/b2fa3-17152636427782-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552802", "eventUri": "eng-9552802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Jamal Murray's emotional meltdown and fines affect the team negatively. Nikola Jokic's lackluster performance and coaching controversies reflect poorly on team commitment.\n\nFor the first time since the 2022-23 NBA season began, the Denver Nuggets are staring in the face of true adversity. On Monday, the Minnesota Timberwolves ran the Nuggets off of their home floor to take a commanding 2-0 lead heading back to Minnesota.\n\nWhat came with it was the Nuggets showing the world who they are: a group of frontrunners that caught the league in a transition period.\n\nIt is no secret that Denver is a really, really good team. Nikola Jokic is one of the game's all-time greats and his supporting cast has shown what they are capable of in the postseason. Jamal Murray has been one of the league's all-time playoff risers. Aaron Gordon has looked like a true star in his role, and Michael Malone fully embodies the team's hard-nosed, homegrown persona.\n\nThe problem is that Denver has not quite figured out how to lose. In Monday's 106-80 loss against Minnesota, the Nuggets had several shockingly embarrassing moments, and that is not about their play on the court.\n\nThe Murray Meltdown Jamal Murray got fined for throwing items on the court\n\nJamal Murray, who has been given the 'closer' moniker, is supposed to be Denver's steady hand in moments of consequence. On Monday night, though, Murray completely melted down emotionally when the going got tough. After taking exception to the referees' calls, Murray made a money sign gesture at the officials, an act that cost Timberwolves' C Rudy Gobert $100,000 during the regular season.\n\nMurray was whining to anyone who would listen: the officials, his coach, Reggie Miller at the table, and even his dad in the crowd. It was, at the very least, a pathetic display of an inability to control his emotions in a moment(s) of doubt.\n\nLater in the contest, the 27-year-old Canadian escalated things a step further, as he proceeded to throw a towel and heat pack onto the court (and seemingly at the referee) from the bench. While the heat pack landed at the feet of the players on the court and, luckily, nobody was injured, it was just another shameful act by a poor loser this postseason.\n\nWas it the most dangerous? The most shocking? The answer, definitively, is no. However, throwing an item from the end of the bench onto the court while scoring 8 points on 18 shots in the biggest game of your season, is downright sad. It is a move that not even the biggest fans of Denver or Murray could defend. It showed mental weakness on Murray's part. It showed cowardice.\n\nAfter the game, Murray refused to speak to reporters and defended his actions. On Wednesday, Murray offered very little explanation but did change his tune.\n\n\"I mean it is what it is and I take everything in full responsibility, so on to the next,\"\n\nApparently, Gobert did not get his money's worth in March because Murray received the same penalty: a $100,000 fine. While no true basketball fan should want to see Murray suspended, the contrast of the two offenses and the similarity of the penalties is noteworthy, at a minimum.\n\nJoker Quits? Game 2 saw a lackluster effort from the MVP\n\nWhat may be even more concerning for Nuggets' fans is the demeanor of Nikola Joki\u0107 in the second half of Game 2. He did nothing embarrassing, nothing inflammatory. He never approached a technical foul.\n\nWhat it did look like, though, is that the now 3x NBA MVP quit. As the defending champion. In Game 2 of the second round. At home.\n\nNikola Joki\u0107's Game 2 Stats\n\nCategory\n\n1st Half\n\n2nd Half\n\nPoints\n\n8\n\n8\n\nRebounds\n\n6\n\n10\n\nAssists\n\n7\n\n1\n\nFGA\n\n8\n\n5\n\nFG%\n\n37.5%\n\n40%\n\nJokic, in the second half, looked completely uninterested in trying to score, posting just eight points and leaving the majority of the shot attempts to his teammates. His defense looked as bad as it has in two seasons, clearly a step slower than the Timberwolves' bigs and rim attackers.\n\nPractice What you Preach Malone got in the face of a referee\n\nFurthermore, Nuggets' coach Michael Malone had his own embarrassing moment in Monday's loss. Despite preaching keeping their poise \"Whether we're not getting calls, whatever it may be,\" Malone had a moment in the first quarter of Game 2 where he walked fully onto the court and got into the face of NBA Official Marc Davis, having to subsequently be separated by other coaches and players.\n\nIt was a moment that baffled the NBA world, wondering how Malone was allowed to stay on the sidelines, let alone not even receiving a technical foul. In that moment, Malone embodied a different side of the Nuggets: the entitled frontrunner.\n\nMalone has said in the past he believes that his getting into altercations with the referees can help spark his team. Was that his intention here, though? In the first quarter of a must-win game? It is certainly hard to fathom that that would be the case.\n\nFor all the talk of whether Michael Jordan is really Anthony Edward's father, it seems that Malone and the Nuggets might be calling Anthony Edwards \"daddy\" pretty soon.\n\nRelated Jalen Brunson Shows Respect to T.J.

However, the Minnesota Timberwolves seem to have total control over the Nuggets after winning the first two games in the semifinal series. Unfortunately, the Nuggets are not responding well to the pressure situation and an example of that can be seen by how Jamal Murray behaved during Game 2. The 27-year-old threw a towel and a heat pack on the court in a moment of frustration.\n\nMurray successfully avoided suspension for his act but couldn't go unpunished as he was given a $100,000 fine. A one-game suspension, which most people were suspecting of the Nuggets star would've further damaged their chances of making a comeback in the series. While discussing the topic on a recent episode of the Run It Back show, Lou Williams said that he is happy for Murray because he didn't get suspended as that'd give the Nuggets an excuse after losing more games or even the series.\n\nWilliams said, \"The NBA could've easily gave these guys an out, suspend them for game 3, now there's your built-in excuse, now the fans are like 'ahh it'd be different if Jamal Murray was playing'. Like nope, you're going to stay here and finish getting your a** whooped.\" Williams believes that the Wolves will kick the Nuggets out of the race, and he's happy Murray will get to experience it with the rest of the team.\n\nThe former NBA star said that he appreciates the league for the way they handled it to keep the series fair, but Chandler Parsons saw it for something else. He said, \"They're setting the standard\" in the league for offenses and punishments. He believes that some player in the future will get suspended for doing something much less offensive, but those rules won't apply to stars and key players like Murray.\n\nIn addition to that, according to Parsons, it wasn't a fineable offense so it's better to let Murray go with a fine. While he didn't see any harm in it, another NBA veteran thinks that Murray's action could've been dangerous.\n\nThe Nuggets had a rough Game 2 against the Wolves. Right before the halftime, they were down 28 points, which is not something we can usually say about the Nikola Joki\u0107's squad. Unfortunately, it happened, and that frustrated Murray to the point where he even risked injuring several players on the court, including some of his own.

He also avoided a suspension and punishment for making a money sign at an official earlier in the second quarter.\n\nMurray on Wednesday didn't have much to say about his actions that endangered players on both teams and Marc Davis' officiating crew or the fine issued by the league.\n\n\"Nah, I mean it is what it is and I take everything in full responsibility, so on to the next,\" Murray said when asked whether he had expected the fine and if he felt his punishment was appropriate.\n\n\"Yeah, on to the next. I mean, two days ago, not much for me to say about it right now.\"\n\nNuggets coach Michael Malone, however, had a stern message for his team Wednesday.\n\n\"Guys, we're the reigning world champions,\" Malone said. \"Act like it and play like it.\"\n\nMinnesota heads home with a 2-0 lead in the best of seven Western Conference semifinal series.

They all say they do but we will all find out collectively come Friday night.\"\n\n\"We've just got to be ready to play and not get frustrated with how the game goes sometimes and we allowed it to take us out of our game,\" said Murray, who has been flummoxed by a strained left calf, a lost shooting touch and a paucity of whistles going his way. \"So, we've just got to stay composed and find a way to stick together during the game and figure it out.

Check out how his Q&A with reporters went after Denver's practice on Wednesday.\n\nMurray was caught on camera throwing a towel in the direction of officiating crew chief Marc Davis, and then moments later grabbing a heating pad and tossing it in the direction of Davis.

That's what it is. It's pathetic.\"\n\nTimberwolves head coach Chris Finch ripped Murray's antics, calling the heating pad incident \"immature and dangerous.\" Others in the national media were calling for Murray to be suspended for Friday night's Game 3, though their wish was not granted when the league simply hit Murray with a fine equal to the penalty Rudy Gobert paid during the regular season when he flashed a money sign at the officials.\n\nMurray and the Nuggets are in an 0-2 hole and facing what amounts to a must-win game Friday in Minneapolis.

With every possession and point so crucial, missed calls or perceived biases can significantly impact a game's outcome. In Game 2 of the Western Conference semis between the reigning champions Denver Nuggets and the Minnesota Timberwolves, the cameras caught Nuggets point guard Jamal Murray throwing a heat pack onto the floor.\n\nWhile the play didn't impact the action on the floor, many saw Murray's act of frustration as dangerous as anyone could have stepped on the pack, potentially causing an injury. While some corners called for a severe sanction to be slapped on the high-scoring guard, the NBA announced on Wednesday that Jamal would be fined a whopping $100,000 for his actions.\n\nThe league rarely gets praise for decisions like this. However, former Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams lauded the NBA for not suspending Murray for the pivotal Game 3 on Thursday in Minnesota.\n\nNot giving the Nuggets any excuse\n\nDenver finds itself in a world of trouble. Down 2-0 to a Timberwolves squad that is rolling like a freight train, the Nuggets could have had a ready-made excuse had they lost Game 3 with Murray not playing. However, the league was not having any of that.\n\n\"I love it. The NBA could have easily given these guys an out, suspending them for Game 3. Now there's your built-in excuse. Now the fans are like, 'Oh, it'll be different if Jamal Murray was playing,'\" LouWill said on \"Run It Back.\" \"It's like, no, you're going to stay here and finish getting your ass whooped, or you're going to walk him down and tie this thing up in Minnesota one way or another. You're going to be a part of this.\"\n\nAs the playoffs go deeper, the intensity rises, creating a contentious atmosphere between players, coaches, and game officials. However, it appears the league is giving the competing teams a longer leash, which the former high-scoring guard appreciates.\n\n\"I appreciate the league for doing this. I appreciate the league for not ejecting Coach Mike Malone,\" Lou added, referring to the Nuggets coach who got into it with referee Marc Davis early in the game. \"You know, I've been seeing a lot of different actions coming from the league office that I haven't seen in the past, so I'm encouraged.\"\n\nFormer NBA forward Chandler Parsons, who co-hosts the show, said he agreed with Williams' sentiments, saying the punishment fit the crime.\n\n\"I'm with Lou. I agree this is a finable offense. Nothing happened; no one got hurt. The play didn't even stop; it resumed play, and I think everyone was more confused. I thought it was a ball boy that accidentally did it or something,\" Parsons remarked.\n\nInexcusable and dangerous\n\nWith Minnesota dominating every facet of this series so far, it's understandable that frustrations are boiling over in Denver's camp.

When both Murray and Joki\u0107 were on the floor in the regular season, the Nuggets recorded a 127.9 offensive rating in 2849 possessions, ranking in the 99th percentile, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nJoki\u0107 is one of those all-time players who will put up numbers regardless of what the defense does. Either he kills you with scoring, his peerless passing, or a combination of both.\n\nEven though he hasn't made a single All-Star appearance, Murray can be the same way. When matching up against the Nuggets in the regular season or playoffs, it's imperative that one of the two is held in check. If not, Denver turns into the team we saw lose only four games in the postseason last year en route to its first championship in franchise history.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have a history of battling against the Nuggets. Both teams are divisional foes and met in the first round of the NBA Playoffs last season. That series went only five games as the Nuggets proved they were head and shoulders above the Wolves, who were without Naz Reid (broken wrist) and Jaden McDaniels (broken hand).\n\nHowever, things are much different this year. Much different.\n\nAfter sweeping the Phoenix Suns in the first round, the Wolves headed to the Mile High City for a rematch with the team that bounced them in the first round last year. Unsurprisingly, Minnesota wasn't favored to beat the Suns or the Nuggets. Still, the Wolves are headed back to the Twin Cities with a 2-0 lead on Denver and an immaculate 6-0 start to the playoffs, which was capped off by a statement, blowout, demoralizing 106-80 win in Game 2 on Monday.\n\nThe Nuggets were held to their lowest point total of the season in Game 2, which came while the Wolves were without Rudy Gobert -- who was awarded his fourth Defensive Player of the Year trophy on Tuesday -- because his girlfriend gave birth to their baby boy Romeo Monday morning in Minneapolis.\n\nA massive part of the defensive success can be explained by simply looking at the box score.\n\nMurray averaged 23.6 points on 40% from the floor against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, featuring two game-winners. Even though he wasn't at 100% because of a calf strain injury, the former Kentucky Wildcat made his impact felt when the games mattered most. However, in the first two games against the Wolves, Murray is averaging 12.5 points on 28.1% from the floor and 25% from deep while being a combined -38 in 69 minutes.\n\n\"I'm not going to make no excuses, bro,\" Murray said after Game 2 vs Minnesota. \"Everybody has got nagging injuries. Everybody is playing through something at this point of the season. My calf is no different than anybody else on the team or in the league, honestly. Obviously, it sucks, but it's not something that I enjoy talking about as part of the loss.\"\n\nHis health has played a significant role in Jamal's ability to explode off screens and get past his defender -- two weapons he relies heavily on -- but Minnesota's backcourt has collectively put him in hell, and his emotions are starting to boil over as a result.\n\nBefore the series shifts to Minneapolis for the first time on Friday night, let's examine a few specific reasons leading to the Blue Arrow's demise so far in Round 2.\n\nThe playoffs are all about adjustments. Seeing a team for up to seven straight games doesn't mean each contest will be the same. In fact, schemes and outcomes can vary drastically from game to game. But if a team has succeeded with certain things, they will run with it until the opposition develops a counterpunch.\n\nAgainst the Suns, the Timberwolves made a few changes to their defensive matchups, which ultimately led to their total domination on that side of the ball. Instead of Karl-Anthony Towns matching up with Greyson Allen, Mike Conley took that duty while Towns switched on the future Hall of Famer Kevin Durant. The Wolves took Allen out of every game he played in, and Towns made life as difficult as possible for Durant. Even though KD averaged 26.8 points on 55.2% from the floor and 41.7% from deep, most of his attempts were positive for the Wolves because they isolations ending in mid-range shots. Those took away from Phoenix's ball movement, thus keeping Devin Booker and Bradley Beal out of the mix for stretches.\n\nMinnesota's coaching staff hasn't drastically changed their matchups against the Nuggets. Still, they've been mixing and matching the looks that Murray sees -- not allowing him to get comfortable or settle into any groove.\n\nHere were Murray's most frequent defensive matchups in the regular season, complete with his stats against them, courtesy of NBA.com.\n\nJaden McDaniels was far and away the most called-upon defender against Murray in the regular season. Both of his matchup minutes logged and partial possessions defended rank second in the NBA, only behind Oklahoma City Thunder wing Luguentz Dort.\n\nWhile Jaden is an incredible defender and has the chops to go down as one of the most versatile defenders in NBA history, he has had trouble against certain isolation-heavy guards, with Murray being on the top of that list, as the matchup stats above illustrate.\n\nOff the jump in Game 1, the Timberwolves switched up their looks. Instead of McDaniels defending Jamal, Anthony Edwards took that challenge with Jaden matching up against 6-foot-10 forward Michael Porter Jr. Instead of relying on those matchups throughout the majority of the game, Minnesota kept things fresh.\n\nBelow are Murray's matchup stats through the first two games against the Wolves via NBA.com.\n\nAs we can see, the matchup minutes and partial possessions are very spread out. The Wolves' capability to divide and concur in defending a player who averages 24.5 points over his career in the playoffs is a strength unique to them. Murray can only prepare and gameplan so much when a new player defends him almost every other possession. He can only watch so much film, and he can only make so many in-game adjustments.\n\nMinnesota is set up always to have a counter for Jamal, but its success against the Kitchener, Ontario native goes far deeper than matchups. Simply put, no matter who is defending him, Murray doesn't have any space at any point in the game to find a groove.\n\nIn the regular season, according to Synergy, Murray averaged 0.97 points per possession in isolation, ranking him 25th in the NBA with a 61.1 percentile (minimum of 1.8 possessions per game). Those aren't head-turning numbers, but he still ranked above Trae Young, Brandon Ingram, Jalen Brunson, Durant, and Edwards, to name a few. Without a doubt, Murray's isolation numbers would be higher if he didn't share the court with Joki\u0107 for 76% of his total minutes played this season. However, he is still a threat with the ball in his hands, whether coming off a screen or in isolation, so physical on-ball defense is needed to contain him.\n\nThe first example comes from the first possession of Game 1.\n\nRight away, Conley denies the pass to Kentavious Caldwell-Pope by fronting. Aaron Gordon defers to Murray, who dumps the ball off to Joki\u0107. Once the Joker realizes his chances of connecting on a low-post shot aren't great and the shot clock is dwindling, he returns the ball to Jamal at the top of the key. Murray tries to get any sort of space with head fakes and a quick step back but cannot because Ant is hounding him. In one final attempt to score, Jamal goes back to the top of the key and attacks inside to his left. However, Edwards said no yet again, using his hands well.\n\nThe play ends with an offensive three-second and Edwards nodding his head, setting the tone early and preluding what was to come the rest of the first half as Murray was held scoreless for the first time this season on 0-of-5 from the floor in 14:38 minutes.\n\nShifting gears to the fourth quarter of Game 1, Murray is yet again operating in isolation; this time, his defender isn't Edwards, McDaniels, or Alexander-Walker. Instead, Conley logged only 1:29 matchup minutes against Jamal through the first two games.\n\nOnce Gordon realizes Murray has a smaller defender on him, he places himself in the weak-side dunker's spot while Christian Braun, Porter Jr., and Joki\u0107 are spaced from deep. Minnesota Mike finds himself on a deserted island with no reinforcements. Still, he keeps close to the Wilson ball as Tom Hanks did in Castaway and offers up some tremendous defense against Jamal, who already has seven points in the quarter.\n\nContinuing with stellar defense in mismatch situations, we have Naz Reid's effort in Game 2.\n\nOff the screen, Murray gets the mismatch he wants, extending Reid to the 3-point line, and every other Nugget spaced on the weak side. Monte Morris, Kyle Anderson, and Daishen Nix begin yelling at Naz once he gets the matchup, seemingly to hype him up. Big Jelly responds to his teammates by shuffling his feet, taking a low-post blow from Murray, rejecting his shot impressively, and staring him down after the fact.\n\nWe've talked so much about Reid's growth over the last few seasons. He's slimmed his body down and looks like a completely new player from when the Wolves signed him in 2019 out of LSU. Typically, his flashy layups, crossovers, or consistent 3-point shooting lead us to converse about his development, but defensive plays like the one above signify far more growth from the 6-foot-9 forward.\n\nIf he can consistently thrive in mismatch situations while improving his low-post defensive IQ, Minnesota's entire rotation will be a defensive force to be reckoned with.\n\nMurray has yet another mismatch in this clip, with Kyle Anderson defending him beyond the 3-point line. And again, he is unable to do anything with it.\n\nWhen Murray attacks into the paint, Minnesota's defense collapses, forcing him into a turnover -- textbook defense. However, before that could even transpire, Anderson stayed connected to Jamal outside, battled through a screen, and temporarily poked the ball free, which slowed No. 27 down enough to give Slow-Mo time to get back and take away the chance of a pull-up mid-range attempt.\n\nAccording to Cleaning the Glass, 22% of Murray's attempts per game in the regular season were in the long mid-range (outside of 14 feet and within the 3-point line), ranking in the 98th percentile among guards. He loves to come off screens and will kill the opposing defense from the mid-range if they allow him to. Fighting over screens isn't enough to remove his offense from that range. High levels of physicality and decision-making are essential. This is also where his limited explosion impacts him; it makes it easier for the Wolves' length to prevent him from getting into the mid-range for open jumpers out of pick-and-roll.\n\nThis clip resulted in a foul, but it demonstrates exactly what it takes to limit Murray's damage off PnRs with Joki\u0107, who frequently gets away with illegal screens.\n\nLike he has done all season, but particularly in the playoffs, Alexander-Walker picks up Jamal at the center-court logo, forcing Denver to initiate its half-court offense from a less-than-ideal spot on the floor. Could NAW have gone under the screen because of how far away from the hoop he was? Sure, but that isn't in his DNA.\n\nWhen Alexander-Walker fights over the pick, Reid initially plays a little help defense. He doesn't commit to the ball handler all the way, but he fakes as if he is to potentially make Murray second guess attempting a mid-range or kicking the ball to the Joker outside.\n\nThat split-second of uncertainty allows NAW to remain with Jamal on the attack and take away any chance for an uncontested layup.\n\nHere's another prime example of stellar PnR defense coupled with a team-wide desire to come away with the defensive stop from Game 2.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Alexander-Walker fights as hard as he can to get over an illegal screen from Joki\u0107. Reid steps up to take away the floater before retreating back to Nikola on the roll. Murray backsteps into what would have been a wide-open long mid-range attempt, but for some reason, MPJ is spacing four feet beyond the 3-point line, making Jaden's decision to step up and contest Jamal's attempt a very easy one.\n\nFrom that point, the Wolves -- who already packed the paint -- make Joki\u0107's putback attempt incredibly difficult. They are unable to come away with the defensive rebound, but Minnesota's ridiculously impressive flurry of defense, which was capped off by Naz's block, more than made up for it.\n\nThat entire sequence sums up the first two games almost to a tee.\n\nThis example includes a complete team effort from the Wolves as Murray rolls off the double screen from Justin Holiday and Gordon.\n\nDenver's movement was snappy in this play. Jamal quickly attacked into the lane, and as soon as Reid, Towns, and McDaniels collapsed in the paint with Reggie Jackson wide-open in the left corner, he whipped the ball to the open man. Jaden responded by quickly rotating back to the corner and taking the triple away from Jackson.\n\nMinnesota's rotations have been on another level this season. Not very often does a shot go uncontested because of poor rotations or defenders losing sight of their man. Sure, being loaded with lengthy defenders helps in that regard, but the Wolves' incredible knowledge of where to be and when to be there is the overarching reason.\n\nTo wrap up, I would be remiss not to include these clips, both of which put the figurative cherry on top of what the Timberwolves' defense is all about. In the first example, Murray is doubled at the half-court, and in the second, Alexander-Walker simply contains Jamal's initial attempt to get past him but smiles because NAW is on him \"like braces on crooked teeth,\" said Jamal Crawford on the TNT broadcast.\n\nThe Wolves head back to Minneapolis for Games 3 and 4 with a 2-0 lead. They are now second only to the Boston Celtics for the highest odds of winning the NBA Championship. Like it has all season, their defense is a massive reason for success.\n\nNever take what you see, Wolves fans, for granted. This is one of, if not the best, defensive teams in NBA history, and it boils down to having length, of course, but also players who are all working toward one goal on defense.", "source": {"uri":

Now, they find themselves down 0-2 to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Following their second loss, they coach touched on how to overcome such an obstacle.\n\nWhen asked about their current situation, Nuggets head coach Michael Malone is taking things one game at a time. He also preached to them that teams have passed have come back from the hole they are currently in. For Malone, having the proper mindset is key moving forward.\n\n\"Is it possible? Yes,\" Malone said. \"History tells us its possible. You have to participate in your own recovery. Just because it's been done before doesn't mean we're going to do it. Only if we have the requisite mindset. That's what the biggest thing is.\"\n\nThe biggest uphill battle for the Denver Nuggets is they have to come back on the road. Going into a crazed Minnesota environment to claw back into the series will be no small feet. However, the defending champs don't have much of an option at this point.\n\nDenver will take on Anthony Edwards and company on Friday night in Game 3.\n\nMichael Malone didn't like Denver Nuggets' attitude following Game 2 loss\n\nAs a team that has regularly been in the playoffs in recent history, the Denver Nuggets understand that the postseason is full of ups and downs. That said, Michael Malone was not pleased with his team's attitude following their most recent loss.\n\nAfter practice on Wednesday, Malone spoke on what he saw from the group after their Game 2 loss. He feels the team is starting to fall off an separate, when now is the time they should be coming together.\n\n\"I was probably more disappointed with our reaction to the adversity,\" Malone said. \"I had never seen that in my nine years. First time in the last six years of making the playoffs.\"\n\n\"As things got tough, we just kind of fell apart and kind of separated. As we all know, you can't do that. That's when you need to come together, help each other and support each other.\"\n\nThere are two keys for the Denver Nuggets as they look to battle back from down 0-2. The first is to get Jamal Murray going offensively. He is their top scoring option behind Nikola Jokic, but he has struggled to get things going against the Timberwolves defense. In Game 2, Murray finished with just eight points on 3-for-18 shooting.\n\nDenver's other focus needs to be on slowing down Anthony Edwards. He has been one of the NBA's top playoff performance, most recently having a 43-point outburst in Game 1. If the Nuggets want any shot at coming back in the series, they need to contain the emerging superstar.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_mccormick@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Kevin McCormick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23148372-1715262855.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552802", "eventUri": "eng-9552802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Rudy Gobert, the freshly-named Kia Defensive Player of the Year who missed the last game because of the birth of his first child, returns to the lineup. What's not to like from the Wolves' standpoint?\n\nThis team is restless, hungry, smells blood and a spotless 6-0 through the playoffs. The Nuggets are reeling and vulnerable, for the first time in the last two post-seasons.\n\nThe good news is Jamal Murray didn't hit anyone with that heat pack in Game 2. The bad news for the Nuggets is he hasn't hit many shots, either, in this series.\n\nMurray is one of the coldest -- in a negative way -- designated scorers in the playoffs, period. He shooting 37.5% overall in the playoffs and 28.6% on 3-pointers. These playoffs would be miserable for him were it not for those game-winners against the Lakers.\n\nYes, Murray is dealing with a sore calf, but he wasn't hitting shots before he tweaked it. Having a wounded calf and missing jumper puts the Nuggets in a bind, too. Lastly, his pick-and-roll with Nikola Jokic is critical to Denver's success.\n\n\"Jamal will bounce back,\" said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. \"Jamal's not making any excuses and I'm not making any excuses for Jamal Murray.\"\n\nThe Nuggets didn't help themselves when they failed to address the need for a solid backup at point guard -- opting to forego that move both in the offseason (when they lost key pieces off the bench) and at the trade deadline. Christian Braun isn't a dependable shooter or playmaker, and Reggie Jackson is limping.\n\nThis means that against this tremendous Minnesota defense, the Nuggets lack options at that position.\n\nIt's too bad for Murray. He made his reputation in this league by rising in the postseason and injuries prevented his making any All-Star or All-NBA teams in his career.\n\n\"I'm just doing what I can to give my team what they need out there,\" he said. \"I haven't been shooting great but I expect the next game to be different.\"\n\n2. More aggression from Jokic, or else\n\nHe now has three Kia MVPs in four years and that stretch of dominance compares with the greats in NBA history. We've certainly seen Jokic at his best. Which makes what we're seeing now seem so weird.\n\nHe's not as forceful, especially in the paint. He's reckless with the ball. And there were times in Game 2 when his body language screamed ... surrender.\n\nThis isn't \"The Joker\" who ruled the first round against the Lakers, or who triple-doubled his way through the 2023 playoffs. He seems spooked by the Wolves and specifically, Minnesota's size, at least in Game 2.\n\nHere's another reason it's weird -- Jokic averaged a 33.3 points and a double-double against the Wolves during the regular season. He looks for his shot and takes satisfaction when Gobert defends him.\n\nIn this series, the Wolves are not only sending a platoon of bigs, all giving different looks -- Gobert, Karl-Anthony Towns, Naz Reid, Kyle Anderson -- their guards are crashing as soon as Jokic puts the ball on the floor. That's partly why he has 11 turnovers in this series.\n\nThe Nuggets will need Jokic to be more selfish (which isn't his nature) if only to ease the burden from Murray and make him more comfortable. That could force the Wolves to make adjustments.\n\n\"He's just got look to be more aggressive,\" Malone said. \"If they're not doubling, he's got to look to make more shots.\"\n\n3. Edwards going all-out\n\nThe beauty of witnessing the development of a projected superstar is the attitude he's unleashing. All the greats bring a measure of nastiness, a show-no-mercy approach from tip to buzzer.\n\nNot only is Anthony Edwards dropping shots and dunking on heads, but he's also laughing, smiling and talking as he does it. He's out to break open the game and break spirits. Because if you do both, the opponent is left dizzy and develops a sense of doom.\n\nThose opponents then feel defeated, and that's the intent of this Anthony Edwards Experience as it takes the league by storm.\n\nThe atmosphere at Target Center for Game 3 will be festive. Edwards will allow himself to be swept up in the emotion. If he gets off to a great start -- and he hasn't had a tough stretch in this postseason yet -- he'll win the crowd and add another layer of worry for the Nuggets.\n\nEdwards knows (and the Nuggets do, too) what a 3-0 lead means in a best-of-seven NBA playoff series. Sometimes math ain't hard.\n\n4. McDaniels comes of age\n\nThe craziest stat in these playoffs involves a 23-year-old Wolves swingman whose name rings familiar to only the hard-core hoops audience.\n\nJaden McDaniels is a plus-40 through two games ... and has scored five total points.\n\nEven better: McDaniels scored those five points and the Wolves found it necessary for him to average 33 minutes in those games. That speaks to his ability to be disruptive defensively, which is at the core of Minnesota's success.\n\nMcDaniels (6-foot-9, 185) is long, quick and guards multiple positions. The Wolves are putting him on Michael Porter Jr. to contain his 3-point shot, and using him as help on Murray to keep the guard from approaching the rim.\n\nThat's why Edwards needed to give Williams a \"shout-out\" following Game 2, to let the basketball nation know what's up.\n\nThere's also an advantage for the Wolves: When Edwards, Towns, Reid and others are scoring, McDaniels can save energy for defense. At this rate, why should he worry about touches and shots, whether he gets them or makes them?\n\n\"He don't complain, he just keeps guarding, keeps picking up full court,\" Edwards said. \"He's definitely the X-factor of the team.\"\n\nShaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Down 2-0 to the Minnesota Timberwolves, they look outmatched and outgunned in every conceivable way. According to ESPN's Brian Windhorst, that is by design.\n\n\"I think Chris Finch has been plotting this Nuggets game plan for maybe a year. He had this tucked away in the file and this gameplan where they were gonna press full-court. Plus they saw Jamal Murray's calf was a little bit sore and they're like 'We're gonna put it to them.' And they're like 'Why should Jokic get to dribble the ball up to half-court? He's not doing that anymore, we got three centers and we're gonna press him.' And the Nuggets acted like they've never seen that before.\"\n\nThe Nuggets came into this post-season as the overwhelming favorites to win it all. With 3x MVP Nikola Jokic leading the way, they were able to secure a top-three seed in the West and re-establish themselves as the team to beat for the second straight season.\n\nIn the first round, the Nuggets looked borderline invincible against LeBron James and company, and even though they weren't playing at their best, it was enough to easily dispatch an older, weaker, and thinner Lakers squad. But since starting the second round, the Nuggets' situation has completely flipped and it's getting ugly to watch on the court.\n\nAfter a close Game 1 that went down to the wire, the Nuggets were getting desperate to win Game 2 at home. But with the size, strength, and versatility of the Timberwolves' defense, the Nuggets have been completely shut down and it led to them losing all composure on the court.\n\nWhile the series is not yet over for the Nuggets, they haven't been challenged like this since before their title run and it remains to be seen if they can get through this victorious.\n\nThe Timberwolves Are The New Title Favorites\n\nWith two rounds still left to play, the NBA playoffs are far from concluded and any one of the teams remaining has a chance to win it all. In the West, the Timberwolves have been the biggest story of the post-season and they are on a historic pace as the NBA's best defensive team by a mile.\n\nEven without Rudy Gobert in Game 2, the Wolves held their competition to just 80 points through four quarters, including limiting the 3x MVP Nikola Jokic to just 16 points on 38.5% shooting. Jamal Murray went 3-18 in 35 minutes, finishing with just 8 points total.\n\nBesides a brilliant effort on defense, the Timberwolves have also been the NBA's best offense in these playoffs, thanks to Anthony Edwards who is averaging 32.3 points through six playoff games this year. The Timberwolves have gone 6-0 in that span, including a 4-0 sweep against Kevin Durant and the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIn short, the Timberwolves have been ready for this moment and they aren't about to waste the opportunity now that it's finally arrived. With a must-win scenario for the Nuggets on Friday, Edwards and the crew will have a chance to send them to the brink of elimination with a Wolves victory in Game 3.\n\nOf course, even if they do advance in this series, the job would only be half over for the Timberwolves, who have aspirations of winning the championship for the first time in franchise history.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nico_martinez@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Nico Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTI2MDcyOTk4NDA1MzA5/0ac56dd6-23d4-44c5-8bf5-21465e513b9d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552802", "eventUri": "eng-9552802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Win the battle\n\nThe physicality has favored the Timberwolves through two games. If Denver has any hope of making this a series, it starts with upping the intensity. There's a good chance Game 3 is officiated more tightly than Game 2, when the Nuggets got outmuscled on their home court. The Nuggets need to operate under the assumption that same level of physicality will be the norm in Game 3 and scale it back, if necessary. Allowing the Timberwolves to dictate the terms of the fight is akin to giving up the series to Minnesota.\n\nPaul Klee Nikola Jokic, three-time NBA MVP, reflects on how long he'll play for Denver Nuggets | Paul Klee By Paul Klee paul.klee@gazette.com Sign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The new, three-time Most Valuable Player is at risk of being swept in the second round a second time as MVP. Back in 2021, the Nuggets were without Jamal Murray when the Suns broke out the brooms. This year, the Nuggets are operating with a limited version of their clutch point guard and face a similar fate against the Timberwolves. Jokic was a deserving MVP in both seasons, but coming up short of the conference finals is going to lead to the same conversations Joker loves to avoid. A big-time performance in Game 3 will at least delay the hot takes for a few days. Denver needs to feed him early and often.\n\nNuggets Family matters: How fatherhood shaped three-time Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic's sense of legacy By Vinny Benedetto vinny.benedetto@gazette.com\n\n3. Never say die\n\nThe Nuggets looked like they lacked belief for the first time in a long time during Game 2. The Timberwolves have gotten off the better starts in both games, something the Nuggets would like to reverse on Friday. Regardless of what happens at the start of Game 3, the Nuggets can't get discouraged. Big leads can disappear fast in the NBA, something the Nuggets have been on both sides plenty of times this season. After Minnesota led by as many as 32, the Nuggets had a chance to close within 15 or so points early in the fourth quarter. There would've been plenty of time to make things interesting, but Denver didn't have the right mentality. Even if the series is too far gone, the Nuggets and their fans could feel better about the season with a more consistent effort from the team.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vinny_benedetto_vinny_benedetto@gazette.com", "name": "Vinny Benedetto Vinny.Benedetto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Klee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Klee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/1f/f1fc9a90-0f62-5cbb-9de2-718510f388f8/663a8d68e9e20.image.jpg?crop=1839%2C965%2C0%2C80&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552802", "eventUri": "eng-9552802", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

He suggested that a suspension for Game 3 would be appropriate. Williams expressed his view on the situation, stating, \"The NBA could've easily given these guys an out, suspended them for game 3.\"\n\nThe incident occurred during the second game of the 2024 NBA playoff series between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Denver Nuggets. Murray's frustration with the referees led him to throw a hot pack from the bench area, narrowly missing another player's foot.\n\nThe NBA promptly responded by announcing a $100,000 fine for Murray's misconduct.

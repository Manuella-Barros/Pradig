This measure was necessary in order to comply with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) \"prior action\" requirement.\n\nA updated summary, including for \"protected consumers\" whose consumption stays below 200 units per month, will be expeditiously sent via the federal cabinet, which only approved the significant tariff hike last week, per the prime minister's directions.\n\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) changed the schedule of a public hearing from July 8 to July 10 within this context. The power division requested a hearing for an average rise of Rs5.72 per unit, with higher-end domestic and other consumer categories subject to an increase of Rs7.12 per unit. Nepra has been ordered to wait for the updated summary.\n\nSources claim that the PM was informed by other entities, aside from the electricity division, that customers were already quite irate due to piling bills resulting from public holidays during Eidul Azha, as well as increased usage during hot and muggy weather. In certain places, they had previously used violence against distribution company executives to vent their rage.\n\nThe prime minister gave orders on Monday morning to amend the rate increase summary that was previously submitted to Nepra and exempt protected users from the hike before taking off from Islamabad for Quetta. The power division distributed the report as directed by the evening. The government would use both creative rate setting and subsidies to make up the approximately Rs50 billion income shortfall that resulted.\n\nAs part of the IMF's \"prior action and structural benchmark,\" the tariff hike must take effect for all ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric on July 1, 2024. The public hearing is merely a formality, as the Nepra itself determined that a 20 percent (average of Rs5.72 per unit) increase in the uniform national tariff would ensure that the 10 Discos would receive approximately Rs3.8 trillion in funding for the fiscal year 2024-25.\n\nThe tariff was supposed to be raised by 51 percent for \"protected consumers\" using up to 100 units per month and by 41 percent for protected consumers using up to 200 units per month, according to the tariff adjustment summary that the federal cabinet approved through circulation. This category includes more than 15.5 million consumers, of which 10.11 million reside in less than 100 units and 5.5 million in 101-200 units. These consumers are below this barrier and are free to use the roadways at any time.\n\nHowever, individuals unlucky enough to over 200 units even once every six months are classified as \"unprotected category.\" The largest rise of more than 43 percent (or Rs7.12) to Rs23.6 per unit (kilowatt-hour, or kWh) has been proposed for the first 100 units in the \"unprotected category,\" which entails an additional 5.95 million consumers.\n\nThe tariffs for the 101-200 and 201-300 slabs will then increase by 31 percent and 27 percent, respectively, to Rs7.12 per unit and Rs30.1 per unit, respectively. These two groups comprise five million more customers.\n\nCustomers in the next five household groups, which include those with 300 units or more, would pay an increase of 14 percent to 22 percent (Rs6.12 per unit) in addition to a new fixed capacity tax of Rs200-1,000 per kilowatt capacity.\n\nA set price of Rs. 400 per kilowatt would be applied, with the monthly charge rising to Rs. 5,000 based on the approved load capacity. Agricultural customers will also see a tariff hike of 19-44 percent (about Rs5.75 to Rs6.59 per unit) and be subject to a fixed capacity tax of Rs400 per kilowatt.\n\nInstead of the current cost of Rs400-500 per kilowatt, all other customer categories, including commercial, general services, industrial, and bulk, will be subject to a set capacity price of Rs1,250 per kilowatt. The cost for commercial and general services will rise by 17% (or Rs5.89 per unit) to approximately Rs44 in addition to this increase in capacity charges.\n\nHowever, the off-peak cost for all other industries above 25 kilowatt capacity would increase by 8-11pc (Rs2.64 to Rs3.56 per unit), while the peak rates would stay the same. In contrast, the industrial price for the B1 category would be cut by 6-8pc (Rs2-2.65pc) to Rs31.65 per unit.\n\nAccording to the power division, the proposed tariff will bring in Rs3.5 trillion to 10 Discos in revenue this fiscal year, or roughly Rs580 billion more than it did the year before. In addition to any additional modifications in the form of monthly fuel charges and quarterly price adjustments for exchange rate, inflation, and other variables, the total revenue would be around Rs4.2tr after the impact of 18% GST.\n\nAn official stated that the real, applicable average national tariff would now be between Rs65 and Rs72 per unit after including surcharges, taxes, duties, and levies, as well as monthly and quarterly adjustments. The average national base tariff, including for K-Electric, has now been worked out at Rs35.50 per unit for this fiscal year, against Rs29.78 per unit for the previous year. This would yield about Rs3.763tr in revenue to 10 Discos this fiscal year, compared to Rs3.28tr last year.", "source": {"uri": "pakistankakhudahafiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PKKH.tv"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electric_Power_Regulatory_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Electric Power Regulatory Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Electric", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K-Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistani rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://pakistankakhudahafiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/09074501c37c715.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "dateEnd": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 682, "textEnd": 699}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The hearing was sought by the power division for Rs5.72 per unit average increase -- going up to Rs7.12 per unit for higher-end domestic and other consumer categories, but it has asked Nepra to wait for the revised summary.\n\nAccording to sources, the PM had been alerted by some quarters, other than the power division, that consumers already had a lot of pent-up anger following accumulated bills in view of public holidays around Eidul Azha, coupled with higher consumption in hot and humid weather. They had already expressed their wrath through violence against officials of distribution companies in some areas.\n\nBefore flying to Quetta from Islamabad, the prime minister issued instructions on Monday morning to modify the tariff increase summary already submitted to Nepra and exempt protected consumers from the hike. By the evening, the power division had circulated the summary as instructed. The resultant revenue gap of about Rs50 billion would be covered by the government through subsidies and innovative tariff setting.\n\nThe tariff hike has to become effective from July 1, 2024 for all ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric as part of the IMF's \"prior action and structural benchmark,\" and the public hearing is just a formality as the Nepra itself had determined about 20pc (average Rs5.72 per unit) increase in the uniform national tariff to ensure about Rs3.8 trillion in funds to the 10 Discos during the fiscal year 2024-25.\n\nThe tariff adjustment summary approved by the federal cabinet through circulation had envisaged raising the tariff by 51pc for \"protected consumers\" using up to 100 units per month and 41pc for protected consumers using up to 200 units per month. More than 15.5 million consumers fall into this category, including 10.11 million in less than 100 units and 5.5 million in 101-200 units who remain below this threshold and could come on roads anytime.\n\nBut those unfortunate who cross 200 units even once in six months fall in the \"unprotected category\". Among the \"unprotected category\", the biggest increase of more than 43pc (or Rs7.12) to Rs23.6 per unit (kilowatt-hour, or kWh) has been suggested for the first 100 units involving another 5.95 million consumers.\n\nThis is followed by a 31pc and 27pc increase in rates (Rs7.12 per unit each) for the 101-200 and 201-300 slabs to Rs30.1 and Rs34.25 per unit, respectively. Another five million consumers fall into these two categories.\n\nThe consumers of the next five household categories ranging from 300 units and above would face a 14pc to 22pc increase (Rs6.12 per unit each), but they would be simultaneously subjected to a new fixed capacity charge of Rs200-1,000 per kilowatt capacity.\n\nThis fixed charge would be Rs400 per kilowatt and gradually increase to Rs5,000 per month depending on the sanctioned load capacity. Likewise, agricultural consumers would be subjected to a fixed capacity charge of Rs400 per kilowatt, and their tariff increase would range between 19-44pc (about Rs5.75 to Rs6.59 per unit).\n\nAll other consumer categories -- commercial, general services, industrial and bulk -- would be subjected to Rs1,250 per kilowatt fixed capacity charge compared to the existing rate of Rs400-500 per kilowatt. On top of this capacity charge increase, commercial and general services tariff would increase by 17pc (Rs5.89 per unit) to about Rs44.\n\nOn the other hand, the industrial tariff for the B1 category would be reduced by 6-8pc (Rs2-2.65pc) to Rs31.65 per unit, but the off-peak rate for all other industries exceeding 25-kilowatt capacity would increase by 8-11pc (Rs2.64 to Rs3.56 per unit), and the peak rates would remain unchanged.\n\nThe power division said the proposed tariff would generate Rs3.5tr to 10 Discos during the current fiscal year, about Rs580bn higher than last year. After the impact of 18pc GST, the total revenue would reach around Rs4.2tr in addition to any further adjustments in the shape of monthly fuel charges and quarterly tariff adjustments for exchange rate, inflation and other factors.\n\nThe average national base tariff, including for K-Electric, has now been worked out at Rs35.50 per unit for this fiscal year, against Rs29.78 per unit for the last year. This would yield about Rs3.763tr in revenue to 10 Discos this fiscal year, compared to Rs3.28tr last year.

The announcement comes after public outcry over a government's decision to massively increase the tariff, touted as a pre-condition to secure the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) loan. The prime minister, whose government has been under severe criticism for burdening the salaried class through the new budget, said the subsidy would cost the national exchequer Rs50 billion.\n\n\"These households make up 94% of the electricity consumers. This subsidy will be funded through our budget's development fund,\" he said, reminding the nation that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had slashed power prices sans allocation in the budget. PM Shehbaz said under the package, cost of per unit electricity will be Rs4 to Rs5 per unit and consumers of K-Electric will also be eligible for this subsidy.\n\nThe premier said the decision has been taken to provide relief to common man in the wake of increase in prices of electricity. He said these three summer months are the hardest to cope with and ultimately from October onwards as the weather gets pleasant, the electricity consumption also gets down.\n\nAnnual power use in Pakistan is expected to fall consecutively for the first time in 16 years, due to higher tariffs curbing household consumption, according to Reuters. The premier also assured the people of further relief as the government got a fiscal space consequent to its ongoing measures of taxing the elite class, expanding the tax net, closing the non-performing entities and plugging the holes, causing financial leakages.\n\nPM Shehbaz said the government was going to sign a three-year programme with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and had also taken it on board about the relief announced for the domestic power consumers. He added that Pakistan has no choice but to enter a new IMF programme and that Islamabad wants to sign a three-year deal.\n\nPakistan has set a tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($47 billion) for the fiscal year that began on July 1, a near 40% jump from the previous year. It aims to lower its fiscal deficit to 5.9% of gross domestic product from 7.4% last year. In a bid to unlock the IMF programme of over $6 billion, the federal government earlier this month increased the applicable end-power tariff of protected consumers by up to 51% and unprotected consumers by up to 43%, which was earlier slated to take effect from July 1, 2024 before the PM's announcement of power subsidy.\n\nAmong protected consumers' categories, tariff for those who fall under the slab of 1-100 units increased by Rs3.95 per unit from Rs7.74 to Rs11.69 per unit, according to The News report. Also, those protected consumers who fall under the slab of 101-200 will have to at least 41% more as their tariff has increased by Rs4.10 per unit from Rs10.06 to Rs14.16 per unit. For the unprotected consumers, the first four categories will experience a 22-43% increase in their power tariffs.\n\nThe unprotected consumers falling in the slab of 1-100 units a month will experience a maximum hike in the tariff in percentage term as these consumers will pay 43% more in their tariff as their tariff has increased by Rs7.11 per unit to Rs23.59 from Rs16.48 per unit. And those who fall in the slab of 101-200 units a month will pay 31% more as their tariff has swelled by Rs7.15 per unit to Rs30.10 from the existing Rs22.95 per unit. Those falling under the slab of 201-300 units per month will pay 26% more as their tariff has increased by Rs7.12 per unit because their tariff has escalated to Rs34.26 from Rs27.14 per unit.\n\nLikewise, those who fall in the fourth category of the 301-400 units slab will experience a 22% surge in the tariff as their tariff has jumped by Rs7.12 per unit to Rs39.15 from Rs32.03 per unit. Similarly, consumers who fall in the category of 401-500 per month unit slab will face 17% increase as their tariff has surged by Rs6.12 per unit to Rs41.36 from Rs35.24 per unit and those using 501-600 units a month will also brave the increase in tariff by 17% as their tariff has swelled to Rs42.78 from 36.66 per unit.\n\nConsumers who utilise 601-700 units a month will face 16% increase as their tariff has gone up by Rs6.12 per unit to Rs43.92 from Rs37.80 per unit and those who consume above 700 units per month will face a 14% hike as their tariff has increased by Rs6.12 per units to Rs48.84 per unit from Rs42.72 per unit.", "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sajid_salamat@dailytimes.com.pk", "name": "Sajid Salamat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehbaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shehbaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The News International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Family_and_Consumer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Family and Consumer Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Simulations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2024/07/PM-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 2379, "textEnd": 2385}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

For three months, 25 million consumers of the country will benefit from the government's relief.\"\n\nIt added that the move would benefit \"94 per cent of the country's domestic consumers\" of electricity.\n\nAmid public outcry and potential political backlash, the government had decided to step back from about 51pc increase in electricity rates it had approved last week for so-called protected consumers by meeting a 'prior action' required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nOn the instructions of the prime minister, a revised summary was planned to be urgently run through the federal cabinet that only last week cleared the massive tariff hike, including for 'protected consumers'.\n\nAccording to sources, PM Shehbaz had been alerted by some quarters, other than the power division, that consumers already had a lot of pent-up anger following accumulated bills in view of public holidays around Eidul Azha, coupled with higher consumption in hot and humid weather.

This substantial subsidy is aimed at cushioning the financial burden on the national exchequer while ensuring that consumers receive immediate relief on their electricity bills.\n\nFor lifeline customers, who are among the most economically vulnerable segments of society, the government has maintained the existing tariffs to provide continuous support.\n\n- Consumers using up to 50 units per month will continue to pay a tariff of Rs3.95 per unit.\n\n- Consumers using between 51 and 100 units per month will have their tariff remain at Rs7.74 per unit.\n\nThese measures ensure that the most financially constrained households are protected from any increase in their energy costs.\n\nWith the prime minister's endorsement, the increase for consumers using up to 200 units will be officially withdrawn today (Tuesday). This decision reflects the government's commitment to alleviating the economic pressures faced by citizens, particularly in light of the current economic challenges.\n\nAccording to recent estimates, the country is grappling with a significant electricity shortfall of 5,600 megawatts, leading to extensive load shedding across both urban and rural areas. According to media reports, the national power demand stands at 25,000MW, while production is lagging at 19,400MW.\n\nAs a result, electricity load shedding has reached up to eight hours in urban areas and 10 hours in rural regions. In areas experiencing high line losses, residents are enduring even longer durations of 12 to 14 hours without power.\n\nOn July 5, Pakistanis grappling with inflation received another blow as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) announced a massive hike in power tariff.

Consequently, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has rescheduled its public hearing from July 8 to July 10 to allow for consideration of the revised summary.\n\nSources indicate that concerns were raised to the Prime Minister about the existing public frustration over accumulated bills due to Eidul Azha holidays and increased electricity consumption in the hot weather. This frustration has already led to incidents of violence against officials from distribution companies in certain areas.\n\nBefore departing for Quetta, the Prime Minister ordered modifications to the tariff increase summary, exempting protected consumers from the hike. By evening, the power division had circulated the updated summary. The government plans to cover the resultant Rs50 billion revenue gap through subsidies and innovative tariff setting.\n\nThe tariff hike, scheduled to take effect from July 1, 2024, for all ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, was a \"prior action and structural benchmark\" under the IMF agreement. The public hearing by Nepra is largely a formality, as Nepra had already determined a 20% average increase in the uniform national tariff to ensure Rs3.8 trillion in revenue for the 10 Discos during the fiscal year 2024-25.\n\nThe initial tariff adjustment summary approved by the federal cabinet included a 51% increase for protected consumers using up to 100 units per month and a 41% increase for those using up to 200 units per month. This category includes over 15.5 million consumers.\n\nUnprotected consumers, those who exceed 200 units even once in six months, were facing the highest increase of more than 43% (or Rs7.12) per unit, raising their cost to Rs23.6 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the first 100 units. Approximately 5.95 million consumers fall into this category. The next slabs of 101-200 and 201-300 units were to see increases of 31% and 27% respectively, bringing their rates to Rs30.1 and Rs34.25 per unit.\n\nFor higher consumption categories, from 300 units and above, the increase ranged from 14% to 22%, along with a new fixed capacity charge ranging from Rs200 to Rs1,000 per kilowatt. Agricultural consumers would also see a fixed capacity charge of Rs400 per kilowatt, with tariff increases between 19-44%.\n\nCommercial, general services, industrial, and bulk consumers were to face a fixed capacity charge of Rs1,250 per kilowatt, a significant rise from the current Rs400-500 per kilowatt. However, the industrial tariff for the B1 category was to be reduced by 6-8%.\n\nThe power division noted that the proposed tariff would generate Rs3.5 trillion for 10 Discos in the current fiscal year, approximately Rs580 billion more than the previous year. Including an 18% GST, total revenue was projected to reach around Rs4.2 trillion, with further adjustments for monthly fuel charges and quarterly tariff adjustments.\n\nThe average national base tariff for this fiscal year, including for K-Electric, is now calculated at Rs35.50 per unit, up from Rs29.78 per unit last year. This would yield about Rs3.763 trillion in revenue for the Discos, compared to Rs3.28 trillion last year. The effective average national tariff is expected to be between Rs65 and Rs72 per unit after surcharges, taxes, duties, levies, and other adjustments.", "source": {"uri": "en.dailypakistan.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Pakistan Global"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electric_Power_Regulatory_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Electric Power Regulatory Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Electric", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K-Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quetta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/digital_images/large/2024-07-09/govt-halts-electricity-tariff-hike-for-protected-consumers-amid-public-outcry-1720506342-7032.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "dateEnd": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 604, "textEnd": 621}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The government will provide a subsidy of about Rs50 billion under the decision, which would be for three months, from July to September.\n\nThe News has learnt that the consumers falling in the protected slab of up to 200 units will benefit from the relief being worked out. \"It can be announced anytime soon,\" said an official who was hesitant to share the details. However, he said it would be a kind of summer package meaning thereby this will be an ad-hoc in nature to be applied in the weather setting a new record of heat.\n\nThere are around 29 million domestic consumers and 52 percent of them are consuming units ranging from one to two hundred. Among them, four percent are lifeline consumers -- the users having single phase electric connection with a sanctioned load up to one kilowatt. They also fall in the category of protected slab; a definition covers all those consumers utilising the power up to 200 units. Again, the pricing formula varies within this category depending on their consumption like those using up to 100 units are cost less than those who consume up to 200 units.\n\nThe household recording consumption up to 300 units is the second biggest category; they form 32 percent of the total consumers. Three percent consumers use units between 300 and 700 and only two percent's utility crosses 700 units. Domestic consumers constitute 89 percent of the total users. There are nine percent commercial consumers and one percent each are industrial, agricultural and general services.\n\nThe government hiked the power tariff from July 1, in a bid to finalise the deal with the International Monetary Fund. In the process, it spared neither the protected nor the unprotected consumers as those falling under the slab of 1-100 units per month will get electricity at 51 percent price above the previous rate as the cost increased from Rs7.74/unit to Rs11.69/unit. For those consuming between 101 and 200 units, 41 percent increase was registered from Rs10.06 to Rs14.16.

The government's relief will affect 25 million people nationwide for three months.\n\nAdditionally, it stated that \"94% of the country's domestic consumers\" of power will benefit from the decision.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz announced that the package will offer relief to about 25 million domestic consumers who come under the protected category, up to Rs7 per unit, for a three-month period ending in September.\n\n\"Today, Rs 50 billion has been set aside to give our protected category customers who use up to 200 units per month for three months, from July to September, a relief of Rs 4 to 7 per unit as a concession.\n\nThe prime minister stated, \"This will benefit about 25 million domestic power consumers, which constitute about 94 percent of the total consumer base.\"\n\nIn contrast to the \"hollow claims\" of past administrations, he said, the federal government has eliminated the aforementioned sum from its development budget in order to fulfill its commitment to providing public relief.\n\nShehbaz further promised the populace that more relief will come as a result of the government's continuous efforts to close non-performing enterprises, tax the wealthy, broaden the tax base, and plug financial leaks.\n\nHe informed the assembly of senior government officials and federal ministers that the coalition administration's prior 16-month term prevented the nation from going into default by putting politics on the line.\n\nAccording to PM Shehbaz, the government has accepted the relief given for domestic electricity consumers and is planning to sign a three-year agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nHe claimed that because consumers were not paying their power bills, the federal and Balochistani governments had come to an agreement a day earlier to solarize over 28,000 tube wells in the province, saving an estimated Rs80-90 billion annually.\n\n\"A business model is being prepared in this regard,\" he informed the participants, adding that \"the same model will be launched in other provinces as approximately a million tube wells are being run on imported oil having a financial implication of $3.5bn on foreign exchange.\"\n\nAccording to PM Shehbaz, the yearly budget includes additional taxes on the real estate industry that are expected to produce approximately Rs100 billion.

We must do away with debts and beggarly if we are to see the nation thrive. He went on, \"The only way is to put in the work and make the elite class pay back to the country. We also need to take advantage of the enormous potential in the mining, information technology, agriculture, and mineral sectors.\"\n\nThe administration opted to reverse the roughly 51 percent hike in electricity rates it had approved last week for so-called protected consumers due to public uproar and the possibility of political fallout by complying with an International Monetary Fund (IMF) \"prior action\" requirement.\n\nA updated summary was scheduled to be quickly reviewed by the federal cabinet, which just approved the significant tariff increase last week, even for \"protected consumers,\" per the prime minister's instructions.\n\nSources claim that PM Shehbaz was informed by various entities, aside from the electricity division, that customers were already extremely irate due to piling bills resulting from public holidays during Eidul Azha, as well as increased usage during hot and muggy weather. In certain places, they had previously used violence against distribution company executives to vent their rage.\n\nThe prime minister gave orders on Monday morning to amend the rate increase summary that was previously submitted to Nepra and exempt protected users from the hike before taking off from Islamabad for Quetta.

Poor and middle-class households are still feeling the impact of the IMF's bailout of Pakistan last year, which involved a series of power tariff hikes over 12 months as part of the IMF programme which ended in April.\n\n\"We are giving this respite for three months: July, August and September,\" the prime minister told a news conference, with a view to cooling temperatures in October when electricity consumption falls.\n\nHe said the decision to delay the raising of power tariffs would benefit 94% of domestic households as the country of 300 million people face summer temperatures surging to a near record. He added that Pakistan has no choice but to enter a new IMF programme and that Islamabad wants to sign a three-year deal.\n\n\"The government will give a discount of Rs50 billion to the electricity lifeline consumers in July, August and September. For three months, 25 million consumers of the country will benefit from the government's relief,\" read a post shared on state broadcaster PTV News' official account on social media platform X.\n\nIt continued that the development would benefit \"94% of the country's domestic consumers\" of electricity. The premier said the move would provide relief of up to Rs7 per unit to around 25 million domestic lifeline consumers for three months till September.\n\n\"Today, an amount of Rs50 billion has been allocated to provide a relief of Rs4-7 per unit as a concession to our protected category consumers using up to 200 units a month for a three-month period from July to September,\" he explained.\n\n\"This will benefit around 25 million domestic power consumers who form around 94% of the total consumer base.\"\n\nHe added that the consumers of K-Electric would also benefit from this relief.\n\nPM Shehbaz elaborated that the amount of Rs50 billion would be used from the development funds reserved in the budget to keep its commitment to public relief against the \"hollow claims\" of previous governments.\n\nThe premier noted that the three summer months - July to September - were the hardest to cope with, but from October onwards, as the weather cools down, the electricity consumption was likely to reduce.\n\nPM Shehbaz assured the people of further relief as the government achieved fiscal space following its ongoing measures of taxing the elite class, broadening the tax net, shutting down non-performing entities and plugging financial leakages.\n\nThe premier noted that the country had no choice but to enter a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and that the government wanted to sign a three-year deal.\n\nHe added that the government had taken the lender on board about the relief announced for the domestic power consumers.\n\nPM Shehbaz highlighted that during its previous 16-month tenure, the coalition government had saved the country from default by putting its politics at stake.\n\nHe said the federal and Balochistan governments had reached an agreement a day earlier to solarise around 28,000 tube wells in the province to save around Rs80-90 billion every year as the consumers were defaulting payment on their power bills.\n\nThe premier continued that the same model would be launched in other provinces as around a million tube wells were being run on imported oil having a financial implication of $3.5 billion on foreign exchange.\n\nHe added that a business model was being prepared for this purpose.\n\nThe prime minister further noted that new taxes were imposed on the real estate sector in the annual budget to generate around Rs100 billion.\n\nHe acknowledged that the salaried class was justified to protest against the tax burden.\n\n\"The time has come for the elite class to pay back to the country. These are the challenges and parasites which are eating up the country. If we have to make the country prosper, we will have to get rid of loans and begging. The only way is to make efforts and make the elite class pay back to the country.\"\n\nThe premier also called for utilising the immense potential in the country's agricultural, information technology, mining and mineral sectors.\n\nIn the wake of the people's uproar and the opposition taking advantage of the situation, the federal government decided to roll back the 51% hike in electricity rates for consumers using up to 200 units it had approved last week to comply with the condition set by the IMF for the next bailout.\n\nA revised summary ran urgently through the federal cabinet for this purpose has been given the nod.\n\nThe National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has revised the date of a public hearing from July 8 to July 10.\n\nThe hearing was sought by the Power Division for Rs5.72 per unit average hike - moving up to Rs7.12 per unit for higher-end domestic and other consumer categories. However, Nepra has been asked to wait for the revised summary.\n\nThe government had set the average national base tariff, including for K-Electric, at Rs35.50 per unit for the ongoing fiscal year against Rs27.78 in the previous one - a hike of Rs7.72.\n\nThe cabinet had approved an increase of Rs3.95 in the tariff for protected consumers using up to 100 units.\n\nA hike of Rs4.10 per unit was given the nod for those who used 101 to 200 units.\n\nPM Shehbaz has called for a federal cabinet meeting to be held on Wednesday (today). The meeting will focus on approving the relief measures for electricity consumers and reviewing the overall economic situation.\n\nIn a related development, sources said the government had decided to abolish the pro-rata system for electricity billing and revert to the previous method.\n\nThey revealed that electricity distribution companies had secretly implemented the pro-rata system since March, leading to widespread overbilling issues.\n\nLast month, it was revealed that over 0.3 million power consumers had moved out of the protected category and paid inflated electricity bills in the month of June because of the new system introduced by distribution companies on the orders of the energy ministry.\n\nHowever, the new system resulted in charging additional units from consumers to complete the 30-day billing cycle, leading to millions of consumers receiving average bills.\n\nAround 326,350 protected consumers had to pay double the bills because of the additional units charged.\n\nThe sources said all the distribution companies were found to be involved in overcharging the consumers, prompting PM Shehbaz and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take immediate notice of the issue.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday urged the international community to recognise the burden being shouldered by Pakistan while hosting such a large refugee population and demonstrate collective responsibility.\n\nThe prime minister, in a meeting with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi at the PM House, reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to addressing the protection and safety needs of people in vulnerable situations and underscored that the international community needed to be mindful of the socio-economic challenges and security threats being faced by Pakistan in this regard, according to a PM Office press release.\n\nWhile recalling Pakistan's longstanding partnership with UNHCR, the prime minister appreciated the UN agency's support to Pakistan in hosting Afghan refugees for over four decades.\n\nHe noted that despite numerous challenges, Pakistan had hosted Afghan refugees with exemplary respect and dignity.\n\nHe sought UNHCR's support in mobilizing adequate resources to supplement Pakistan's efforts in this regard and urged the UN body to play its role in promoting durable solutions to address the situation of Afghan refugees, including through safe and dignified return and reintegration in their homeland, as well as third-country relocation.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner expressed gratitude for Pakistan's generosity and hospitality in hosting millions of Afghan refugees for the past many decades and assured that UNHCR would continue to work closely with Pakistan to fulfill the basic needs of the Afghan refugees.\n\nUN High Commissioner Grandi is on a three-day official visit to Pakistan from July 7-9.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that the government was taking effective measures for economic revival by carrying out the digitisation of the economy including the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and privatisation of the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs).\n\nThe prime minister, in a meeting with a delegation led by British educationist and former Head of British Prime Minister's Delivery Unit Sir Michael Bayldon Barber, said the decades-old ties between Pakistan and the United Kingdom were getting stronger with the passage of time.\n\nHe said that Pakistan greatly values its relations with the UK as being a valued partner, the UK was assisting Pakistan in multiple sectors for which the government was grateful to them.\n\nThe prime minister reiterated the resolve to further strengthen the bilateral relations.\n\nHe told the delegation that the government was pursuing a policy of downsizing and abolishing the low-performing entities to reduce its expenditures.\n\nThe prime minister said that the government was taking measures to boost exports and tax base as the country had immense potential for exports related to information technology and agriculture.\n\nDuring the briefing, the delegation members were told that a task management system had been established to examine the performance of the federal ministries.\n\nSir Michael Barber appreciated the government's economic revival plan and said that it was moving in the right direction in its endeavours for economic reforms.\n\nThe delegation head expressed the hope that under the prime minister's leadership, Pakistan would soon get rid of economic challenges and assured the UK's cooperation in all sectors.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the government's plan, the revised tariffs will apply to consumers using up to 200 units of electricity from July to September 2024.\n\nTo offset the impact of this decision, the federal government will provide a subsidy of approximately Rs50 billion. This substantial subsidy is intended to ease the financial burden on the national exchequer while ensuring immediate relief for consumers on their electricity bills.\n\nFor lifeline customers, who are among the most economically vulnerable, the government has maintained the existing tariffs to provide continuous support:\n\nConsumers using up to 50 units per month will continue to pay a tariff of Rs3.95 per unit.\n\nConsumers using between 51 and 100 units per month will have their tariff remain at Rs7.74 per unit.\n\nThese measures ensure that the most financially constrained households are protected from any increase in their energy costs.\n\nWith the prime minister's endorsement, the increase for consumers using up to 200 units will be officially withdrawn today. This decision reflects the government's commitment to alleviating the economic pressures faced by citizens, particularly in light of the current economic challenges.\n\nRecent estimates indicate that the country is grappling with a significant electricity shortfall of 5,600 megawatts, leading to extensive load shedding across urban and rural areas. Sources in the Power Division report that the national power demand stands at 25,000MW, while production is lagging at 19,400MW.\n\nAs a result, electricity load shedding has reached up to eight hours in urban areas and 10 hours in rural regions. In areas experiencing high line losses, residents are enduring even longer durations of 12 to 14 hours without power.\n\nOn July 5, Pakistanis grappling with inflation were dealt another blow as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) announced a substantial hike in the power tariff.

The federal government has requested for an average increase of Rs5.72 per unit in the base tariff starting July 1, 2024.\n\n\"Lack of improvement in recovery rates over the years is concerning. Will increasing electricity prices lead to better recovery rates?\" asked the Nepra chairman, stressing the need for a \"system of rewards and punishments\" in electricity companies.\n\nHe pointed out that despite setting tariffs based on 100 percent recoveries, the actual recovery rates had not exceeded 95 percent. He warned that if the cost of energy increased, recovery rates might further decline. \"The government will have to take drastic steps; business as usual will not work,\" he added.\n\nAddressing complaints of slab changes through overbilling, the Nepra chairman confirmed that an investigation was currently underway, with 60 percent of the work completed. \"Rest assured, we are working on it, and in a few days, you will see the results,\" he stated.\n\nNepra Member Mathar Niaz Rana referred to the issues in the generation sector as the \"elephant in the room,\" questioning whether the IPPs' efficiencies had been adequately checked. It should be looked into that whether their efficiencies are even near to the regional IPPs.\n\nRana underscored the inefficiencies plaguing the sector, emphasizing the need for a thorough scrutiny and resolution. He mentioned that discussions with the IPPs were possible if the prime minister gave his approval. He noted that there might be room for adjustments, highlighting inefficiencies in electricity generation and the need to address issues like insurance and other related matters.\n\nThe regulator said the tariff for K-Electric will align with that of other distribution companies (DISCOs). It was also noted that the federal government would maintain electricity rates for domestic consumers using up to 200 units per month. It was highlighted that a significant subsidy totaling Rs730 billion for various consumer categories would be paid. Of this amount, Rs490 billion will come from the federal government as budgeted subsidy, with the remainder covered by cross-subsidies.\n\nK-Electric is set to receive Rs177 billion, while Discos will get Rs313 billion. The current fiscal year will see capacity payments amounting to Rs2.16 trillion.\n\nThe consumers voiced their dissatisfaction during the hearing with the increase in electricity tariffs and failure of Nepra in protecting the consumer's interest. The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) stated that billions of rupees in annual capacity payments in the power sector were not unusual.\n\nRecently, the federal government announced a relief package for domestic consumers using up to 200 units per month, effective for three months starting in July 2024. This package will benefit 86 percent of domestic consumers. Consequently, the average basic tariff will see an increase of Rs3.29 per unit from July to September, and Rs4.55 per unit from October onwards.\n\nFor residential consumers, the Nepra has approved Rs9.18 per unit hike in average tariff; however, the government has proposed Rs3.23 per unit from July to September 2024 and Rs6.27 per unit from October to June 2025, the official informed.\n\nSimilarly, for commercial consumers, Nepra has approved an increase of Rs8.96 per unit in average tariff; however, the government has proposed Rs8.04 per unit. Capacity payments have seen an increase of 38 paisa per unit compared to last year.\n\nThe Power Division officials revealed that the electricity price determination was based on an exchange rate of Rs300 per dollar. They reassured that the proposed changes were mere tariff re-settings rather than significant hikes and emphasized that the overall bills for consumers would decrease with the end of adjustments in the coming months.\n\nThe Power Division officials disclosed that the burden of Rs155 billion had been lifted from the industrial sector. They highlighted that the tariff for Pakistan's industry was higher compared to other countries in the region. By maintaining the current tariff, they hope to stimulate industrial growth. Additionally, 77 percent of industrial consumers will not be subjected to fixed charges.\n\nThe Power Division officials said the government was also shifting to local fuel for generation, retiring inefficient state-run generation companies (Gencos), and converting plants and IPPs to local coal. The circular debt has ballooned from Rs280 billion to over Rs2.6 trillion in the past decade, underscoring systemic issues in the power sector.\n\nIn FY2023-24, power theft and inefficiencies accounted for Rs590 billion. However, a recent nine-month drive against power theft recovered Rs95 billion. Nepra has reserved its decision on the government's request for a uniform basic tariff and an increase of up to Rs7.12 per unit starting from July. The decision will be announced later.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_power_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent power producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Electric_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K-Electric F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electric_Power_Regulatory_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Electric Power Regulatory Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elephant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Power_Purchasing_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Power Purchasing Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paisa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paisa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-07-11/l_1208543_050309_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Reversing this decision could open a Pandora's box as each affected segment would call for waivers.\n\nPower tariffs in Pakistan are already complicated. The tariff increases with an increase in consumption. Changes in rates after certain slabs are crossed are irrational. Lifeline consumers are agitated because the additional consumption of only one unit over the 200-unit mark increases their total bill by over 100 per cent.\n\nEarlier, their tariff would increase gradually from 50 units to 100 units, then from 101-200 units and again from 201-300 units. This time the jump after 200 units is steep.We must ensure transparency in our affairs. Lifeline power consumers have been unduly protected for decades. A state starved of resources cannot subsidize a major chunk of power consumers for long.\n\nThey have always been protected from tariff increases and logically cannot enjoy this facility forever. The least that should be done is to increase lifeline consumers' tariff with every periodic increase in the general power tariff, while continuing the previous subsidy, but the subsidy increases if they are protected by every tariff increase.\n\nThe system is so unfair that many households including political families have commissioned 2-24 single phase meters on their premises. Legally it is not allowed to install more than one metre at one address. The first thing that the state should do is to remove all additional single-phase metres from all premises.\n\nAnother way to facilitate lifeline consumers is to gradually eliminate provision of free electricity to the employees of the state-run power sector. The government may start with a 25 per cent cut each year and pass on the benefit to lifeline consumers. Similarly, free power units allowed to the president, prime minister, chief ministers, MNAs, MPAs and judges should also be cut by 25 per cent, and benefits be passed on to lifeline consumers. Any other government functionary enjoying free electricity must also face this cut.\n\nThese savings would be enough to satisfy lifeline consumers who must be warned that from now on there would be a regular 1.0 per cent increase in their tariff for the next 12 months.The government badly needs resources, and it should cut the elite's perks if it wants to appease the electorate.\n\nEliminating free electricity privileges entirely within the next 10 years should be the ultimate goal. Once high-ranking officials start paying normal power bills, inefficiencies in the power sector will automatically improve. Line losses will drop to normal because the elite will not be happy to share the burden of power theft in their bills.\n\nBill collection would be 100 percent; this is how it should be as nowhere in the world power consumers are providing power supply without clearing their power bills.Protests led by people against high power bills should be outside the premises of those who get free power and not at grid stations. This then disrupt power distribution to consumers who somehow pay their bills.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mansoor_ahmad@thenews.com.pk", "name": "Mansoor Ahmad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora's_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pandora's box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric power distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Associations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Power_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Power Tools", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-07-10/l_1208019_015050_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The proposed relief is expected to benefit about fifty percent of domestic consumers falling in the protected category.\n\nIt is good of the Prime Minister to have responded positively to the concerns of the consumers about the additional burden they will bear due to the latest increase that became effective from July 1, 2024. There was already great resentment among all consumers as they received back-breaking power bills for June, 2024 and the fear of more burden due to revision in base tariff, the accompanying increase in taxes and duties levied on percentage basis and uncalled for fixed charges from next month. An elected government cannot remain elusive to the woes of the people and is required to come out with measures to address them satisfactorily. The proposed relief for protected consumers is modelled on a similar initiative that the Prime Minister launched during his tenure as head of the coalition government but the original plan was diluted in the face of opposition from the IMF. According to reports, the latest relief envisages exemption of the protected category for three months of summer for which the government would allocate a subsidy of Rs. 50 billion. Temporary relief and that too for a specific category is no satisfactory solution to the ills of the energy sector and their negative impact on honest consumers. The entire formula for tariff determination is anti-consumers and benefits vested interests including IPPs and inefficient distribution companies. It is regrettable that there is no one to safeguard interests of the people of Pakistan who are openly being fleeced due to formulae like exclusion from the protected category even if a consumer crosses the threshold just for one unit for one month in six months. All people are charged base tariff, monthly fuel adjustment, quarterly fuel adjustment, fixed charges, sales tax and income tax but the circular debt keeps on mounting providing justification to planners and decision-makers to shift more burden on consumers. This exploitative system needs to be changed besides a decisive campaign against electricity theft and revision of agreements with IPPs, which mint money in the name of capacity charges.", "source": {"uri": "pakobserver.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pakistan Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehbaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shehbaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://pakobserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/editorial-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

This relief package is expected to lower electricity costs by Rs4-7 per unit for qualifying consumers, benefiting a substantial 94% of the country's domestic electricity users.\n\n\"The decision to allocate Rs50 billion from our development budget underscores our commitment to public welfare, contrasting sharply with past administrations' empty promises,\" PM Shehbaz affirmed.\n\nHe further assured the nation of additional relief measures, pointing to enhanced fiscal space resulting from efforts to broaden the tax base and curb financial inefficiencies. Highlighting recent agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), PM Shehbaz emphasized that the relief plan had received IMF endorsement, demonstrating the government's resolve to address economic challenges responsibly.\n\nRegarding structural reforms in the energy sector, PM Shehbaz outlined plans to transition thousands of tube wells in Balochistan to solar energy, potentially saving billions in annual expenditures on imported oil. Similar initiatives are slated for other provinces, aiming to reduce foreign exchange burdens and promote sustainable energy practices.\n\n\"The recent adjustments in electricity tariffs reflect our sensitivity to public concerns amidst economic adjustments,\" PM Shehbaz acknowledged, referencing a revised tariff proposal aimed at mitigating financial strain on consumers during challenging economic times.\n\nIn conclusion, PM Shehbaz reiterated the government's commitment to equitable economic policies, urging the privileged classes to contribute towards national prosperity. He underscored the importance of revitalizing sectors such as agriculture, information technology, and mining to unlock Pakistan's economic potential and reduce dependency on external financial support.\n\nThe announcement comes amid rising public discontent over utility costs, signaling a proactive approach by the government to alleviate financial pressures on the most vulnerable segments of society", "source": {"uri": "profit.pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Profit by Pakistan Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehbaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shehbaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dependent territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balochistan, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PM-Shehbaz2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

However, a senior Planning Commission official told the hearing that the cabinet's decision about this relief had yet to be officially notified.\n\nThe public hearing, presided over by Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhar on government's request for rebasing national average tariff envisaging up to 51 per cent hike, attracted strong criticism from almost all consumer categories from across the country, including Karachi. Even the export sector, for which the government claimed to have reduced tariff worth Rs155bn during this fiscal year, claimed that their effective tariff at Rs42 per unit still worked out at 15 cents per unit compared to 8-9 cents in the region, making the sector uncompetitive.\n\nBoth online and physically present consumers criticised Nepra for allegedly acting as a rubber stamp for government tariff hikes, with little effort to address inefficiencies in the power sector.\n\nSome participants also highlighted contradictory policy stance by the Punjab and federal governments, with the provincial government providing subsidised solar panels adding to surplus capacity and the Centre imposing fixed capacity charge on consumers.\n\nElephant in the room\n\nNepra's tariff member, Mathar Niaz Rana, highlighted that he had been pointing out that \"the elephant in the room is generation and needed to be looked into\". He said the government should examine whether the independent power producers (IPPs) and generation plants are operating efficiently without violating their contracts.\n\nSimilarly, the working capital requirements for 15-day operations could be examined in addition to insurance costs and so on. There is a lot of potential to work on operational efficiencies, and it should be looked into. Nepra Chairman Mukhtar said the regulator had a lot of concerns over inefficiencies and the distribution companies were way behind efficiency and regulatory standards, barring a couple of Discos that were meeting or were close to those standards.\n\nHe said the power companies had failed to improve recoveries beyond 92pc over the years, which should be 100pc. \"Drastic steps are needed. Business as usual will not deliver. At least bring some sense of reward and accountability in the system to restore public confidence,\" he asked the government team, led by Joint Secretary of Power Division, Mahfooz Bhatti.\n\nMr Bhatti said the government had already started working in that direction, and the prime minister was himself monitoring power sector reforms. He said the key performance indicators were now being introduced for Discos, support units were being created, and boards were being transformed with sector experts, while some areas also needed investments.\n\nOverbilling probe\n\nNepra's member for consumer affairs, Rafique A. Shaikh, said the power regulator had constituted an investigation team on recent complaints of overbilling through pro rata application of units that moved many consumers out of the protected category or breached a specific slab.\n\nThe team has already visited the Power Information Technology Company that maintained the power sector data on meter reading and billing, etc. and was able to access 60pc of the data, which is currently in the process of sensitivity analysis.\n\nHe noted that similar complaints last year led to an investigation and adjustments for overbilled consumers. He also stated that while Nepra could impose fines on power companies, some decisions faced challenges in higher judicial forums.\n\nThe Nepra chairman disagreed with the general perception that the regulator was acting like a rubber stamp. He said the government had demanded a Rs8.33 per unit increase in the average national tariff, but the regulator brought it down to Rs5.90 per unit, which was further reduced to Rs5.72 on the day of final determinations with the applicability of the last interest rates. He said the final tariff revision decision would be issued in a day or two.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khaleeq_kiani@dawn.com", "name": "Khaleeq Kiani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_stamp_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rubber stamp (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Commission_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Planning Commission (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_rata", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro rata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elephant in the room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ontario", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ontario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Working capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karachi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.dawn.com/large/2024/07/110848580cc1158.jpg?r=084909", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716933", "eventUri": "eng-9716933", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

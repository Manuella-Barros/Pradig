Baba Rahman was one of the notable absentees from the 26-man Black Stars squad announced on Wednesday, May 29, 2024. When asked about the omission of Baba Rahman, who excelled for his club PAOK, which won the Greek league, Otto Addo explained that Baba Rahman is still affected by some negative treatment he received from Black Stars fans during Ghana's game against the Central African Republic in an AFCON qualifier in September 2023. \"I spoke with him, but he doesn't want to come back... I don't know what happened, but I think it affected him and his family. Personal attacks, criticisms... if it's tactical or performance-wise, that's okay, but personal attacks are not good,\" he said. \"We will need him for this game, but when I spoke to him, he was very sure that he was not coming back, and it is our fault that he is not coming back,\" he added. The Black Stars are scheduled to face Mali in Bamako on June 6, followed by a match against the Central African Republic at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium on June 10.

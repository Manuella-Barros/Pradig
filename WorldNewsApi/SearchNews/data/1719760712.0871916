The Labour leader on Wednesday said he did not have any immediate plans to do so, but described Mr Street as \u201ca reasonable person\u201d and suggested his party would welcome Tory-turned-Labour voters. Mr Street, a Conservative, had hoped to cling on in the West Midlands in the May regional elections, but was beaten by Labour challenger Richard Parker with a majority of just 1,508 votes. On Tuesday, Mr Street ruled out running to become an MP in the July 4 election, but hinted that he would be open to another political role. In a statement, the former John Lewis managing director said: \u201cMany will assume now that I am destined to go back into business. \u201cBut I still feel I have much to contribute to public life in a leadership role, and I look forward to exploring opportunities to do just that.\u201d Asked whether he might offer Mr Street a role in a future Labour government, Sir Keir told reporters during a campaign visit to Worcester: \u201cI always felt that Andy Street was a reasonable person. \u201cI\u2019ve not got any plans to work with him. But I thought he was a reasonable person. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasonable people, including people who voted Conservative, even were Conservative candidates as he was, that want to see our country and our communities move forward. \u201cIf we\u2019re privileged to come in to serve, we will be opening an invitation to those that vote Labour and those that don\u2019t traditionally vote Labour.\u201d Mr Street belongs to the One Nation wing of the Conservative Party. In his statement, he said he still believes \u201cstrongly in my brand of moderate and inclusive conservatism and will continue to use my voice ferociously to champion that approach \u2013 whatever happens on July 4\u201d. Following Labour\u2019s win in the West Midlands and a mauling for the Tories in the local elections, Mr Street warned Rishi Sunak against lurching rightwards, saying that \u201cwinning from that centre ground is what happens\u201d.", "summary": "The Tory former West Midlands mayor has hinted he would be open to a political role away from the Commons.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-labour-west-midlands-commons-conservative-b1160843.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/29/13/fee5c3de4e29c2cf20f676e677acc549Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3MDcwMzMx-2.76070263.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:43:39", "author": "Sophie Wingate", "authors": ["Sophie Wingate"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.149}

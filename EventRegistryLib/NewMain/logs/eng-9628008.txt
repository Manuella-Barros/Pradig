It was immediately spun by the establishment media as \"Russian disinformation.\"\n\nThe DOJ previously asserted its authenticity in court filings, but prosecutors asked Jensen to confirm its authenticity before the jury because it plays an important evidentiary role. The laptop contains Whatsapp messages, iMessages, and text messages related to the case.\n\nThe DOJ confirmed the laptop was Hunter's by determining that he left it at a computer store and that the contents matched what authorities obtained via a search warrant of Hunter's iCloud, as Breitbart News reported in January.\n\nHunter's prosecutor also introduced as evidence an invoice for $85 that Hunter received from The Mac Shop, CNN reported:\n\n\"This is the laptop that was recovered from the computer store,\" she [Jensen] said. When asked how she was able to confirm the laptop's authenticity, Jensen said the serial number on the back of the laptop matches the serial number provided in Apple Inc.'s subpoena response for records.\n\nJensen appeared to be making a point of looking at the jury while she explained the concept of iCloud data and how the FBI obtains the data via warrants. The jurors appeared engaged -- a few were taking notes, but most simply listened. Hunter was wearing glasses and appeared to be taking notes when not whispering with his lawyers.\n\nThe witness told the jury that between Hunter's laptop, phone, and tablet, 18,000 pages of messages, photos, and videos were uncovered, per NBC News. Only 75 pages are relevant to the trial.\n\nIt took the establishment media well over a year to admit the story was false. Hunter's laptop holds \"authentic communications that can be verified,\" the Washington Post admitted in March 2022 -- after not pursuing the story for 532 days.\n\nCNN also finally admitted Hunter's \"laptop from hell\" was authentic more than 500 days after the initial story broke on October 24, 2020 -- notably calling it \"Russian disinformation\" and \"made up\" at the time.\n\nAfter nearly two years, the New York Times admitted the emails from Hunter's laptop were his, Breitbart News reported.\n\nFifteen media personalities claimed Hunter's laptop emails were likely Russian propaganda. Perhaps most famously, CBS News reporter Lesley Stahl falsely told President Donald Trump in 2020 that Hunter's \"laptop from hell\" could not be verified.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his press secretary also gave inaccurate statements about the laptop's origin:", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wendell_huseb\u00f8@breitbart.com", "name": "Wendell Huseb\u00f8", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesley_Stahl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lesley Stahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Show Jumping", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Used", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Used", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/Hunter-Biden.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628008", "eventUri": "eng-9628008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-24", "textStart": 2155, "textEnd": 2171}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 271}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

"Today's New York Post cover story updates the saga of Hunter Biden's laptop: \"Hunter Biden gun trial jurors shown infamous laptop first exposed by The Post in dramatic courtroom reveal.\" Yes, indeed, the Post is entitled to keep taking victory laps over its coverage of the laptop from hell.\n\nOver on the editorial pages, Miranda Devine keeps running.\n\nHunter Biden's \"Laptop from Hell\" is government exhibit 16 at the first son's gun trial in Delaware.\n\nThe silver MacBook Pro\u200913, covered in a clear plastic wrapper, was first publicly sighted Tuesday at 2:10 p.m. when it was carried across the court by prosecutor Derek Hines to his first witness, FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen, who confirmed it was Hunter's laptop from the serial number on the back.\n\nSitting at the bar table, Hunter was inscrutable behind salmon pink reading glasses as the laptop that threatens to put him in jail and politically scorch his \u00adfather coasted serenely across the room.\n\nThree years and eight months since you heard it first in the New York Post, Jensen said that the laptop was obtained by the FBI in 2019 with a subpoena from The Mac Shop in Wilmington where it had been \"abandoned\" by Hunter.\n\nShe said that investigators corroborated content on the laptop with Hunter's iCloud that they obtained from Apple with a subpoena.\n\nDevine continues under the subhead We told ya so!\n\nWhen The Post broke the story before the 2020 election in October 2020 -- publishing evidence from the laptop of Joe Biden's involvement in his family's global influence-peddling racket -- we were censored by Big Tech and falsely accused by 51 former intelligence officials of peddling \"Russian disinformation.\"\n\nJohn Brennan, Jim Clapper, Mike Hayden, Leon Panetta, and the rest of the Deep State 51 apparently couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nThen-presidential candidate Biden lied to the American people that the laptop was a \"Russian plant.\"\n\nHe he was lying, but he had the Deep State 51, the Democrats' media adjunct, and the social media giants in his corner.\n\nIf you were not a reader of this newspaper and simply believed the Biden lies, Tuesday's courtroom revelations would have come as a bolt from the blue.\n\nThat last observation is one that is applicable to Biden lies extending far beyond Hunter's laptop, but Hunter's laptop can serve as Exhibit 1 to prove the point.", "source": {"uri": "powerlineblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Power Line"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type":

In prior court filings, Special Counsel David Weiss called their criticism of the laptop's authenticity a \"conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\"\n\nWhen asked by prosecutor Derek Hines if she had seen evidence that Hunter Biden's laptop had been tampered with, Jensen responded \"no,\" according to multiple reports.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted in September on felony gun charges for allegedly making false statements on a gun purchase form and knowingly possessing a gun while addicted to drugs. Prosecutors are using data from the laptop as evidence in the trial to demonstrate Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs at the time of purchase.\n\nAfter the New York Post first reported on the laptop's contents in 2020, former intelligence officials issued a public statement claiming it has \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" The outlet was censored on Twitter following its publication of the report.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys previously argued that the laptop \"may have been tampered with by someone other than Mr. Biden,\" noting \"various media outlets\" that received copies of the data \"concluded it is not\" authentic. Prosecutors fired back in court filings that the data used during the trial was extracted directly by an FBI forensic specialist in 2019 rather than the copy of the data obtained by the media.\n\nJensen also clarified on the witness stand that some data came directly from Hunter Biden's iCloud account rather than the laptop itself, according to NBC News.\n\n\"The same 'Russian disinformation' once 'certified' by 51 former intelligence officials just days before an election is now being used by federal prosecutors as factual evidence against Hunter Biden,\" Republican Georgia Rep.

Hunter Biden's #LaptopFromHell is government exhibit 16 at the First Son's gun trial in Delaware. The silver MacBook Pro covered in a plastic wrapper was first publicly sighted today at 2.10pm when it was carried across the court by prosecutor Derek Hines to his first witness FBI Special Agent Erika Jensen who confirmed it was Hunter's laptop from the serial number on the back that corresponds to his iCloud identity. She said the laptop was obtained by the FBI with a subpoena from The Mac Shop in Wilmington where it had been \"abandoned\" by Hunter. She said that investigators corroborated content on the laptop with content in Hunter's iCloud that they obtained from Apple with a subpoena. Hines then proceeded to go through WhatsApp and text messages and images and documents from the laptop and iCloud with Jensen to make his case that Hunter was using drugs before during and after the period that he bought and possessed the handgun after allegedly signing a background check form on October 12 2018 saying he was not a drug user. His then-lover Hallie Biden later threw the gun in a trash can. The jury kept unsmiling focus throughout the evidence which showed Hunter spending $50,000 a month in ATM withdrawals during that period and organizing alleged purchases of crack cocaine. Hunter's disembodied voice filled the courtroom periodically as prosecutors played audiobook extracts from his memoir and he remained impassive behind a pair of salmon pink reading glasses. Hallie Biden will be a witness by the end of this week or next week after Hunter's ex wife Kathleen Buhle and ex lover Zoe Kestan. It is three years and eight months since @nypost broke the story of #LaptopFromHell that was censored by Big Tech. A few days later in October 2020 the #Dirty51 ex-intelligence officials, mostly CIA, lied it was Russian disinformation and then-presidential candidate Joe Biden lied that it was a \"Russian plant.\" Read more at @nypost\n\nYet there will be no apologies, corrections or accountability from the media or their Democrat masters.\n\nInstead those same people will just move on to pushing the next lie.\n\nProbably not.\n\nThey \"helped\" the side that claims to be trying to save democracy so the Left considers their election interference an act of patriotism, or something like that.", "source":

electronic material,\" his lawyers wrote.\n\nBut Weiss shot down Hunter's defense team's argument before submitting the laptop into evidence, confirming that it was indeed authentic.\n\n\"He has not shown any of the actual evidence in this case is unreliable or inauthentic, because there is none,\" Weiss' team wrote. \"Instead, the defendant's theory about the laptop is a conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\"\n\nThe DOJ confirmed the authenticity of Hunter's laptop in a January court filing, and that Apple produced backups of data from several of Hunter's electronic devices that he had backed up to his iCloud account.\n\nThe New York Post first broke the story about Hunter's laptop in October 2020, which was met with vehement pushback by the Biden team, mainstream media, and former intelligence officials who called it \"Russian disinformation.\"\n\nTwo years later, CNN, The New York Times and other corporate outlets finally acknowledged Hunter's laptop was

Then-President Donald Trump and candidate Joe Biden duked it out in their second and final presidential debate before the election.\n\nTrump made references to the recently published New York Post story about Hunter Biden's now-infamous laptop.\n\n\"They're calling it the laptop from hell,\" Trump said.\n\nHow right he was. The laptop just made an official appearance in federal court this week. More on that shortly.\n\nDuring the 2020 debate, Biden angrily defended his son (and himself), conveniently reciting a letter by so-called former intelligence officials penned just days before the debate: \"We do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not.\"\n\n\"There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he's accusing me of is a Russian plant,\" Biden said. \"They have said that this has all the ... five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.\"\n\nCNN's response? It \"fact-checked\" whether Trump \"spread Russian disinformation during the debate.\"\n\nIt turns out the ones who were spreading garbage were Biden and these disinformation \"experts,\" who along with a complicit mainstream news media, quashed and discounted an important story just weeks before the presidential election.\n\nBecause the laptop showed up again this week in a federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where Hunter Biden is being tried on three felony gun charges.\n\nIt turns out that the laptop that was once widely denounced is now being used as evidence by federal prosecutors to prove the president's son lied about his drug use on a gun form.\n\nIt's very real.\n\nAnd testimony from an FBI special agent reiterated that the FBI had the laptop in its possession in 2019 after Hunter Biden had deserted it at a repair shop.\n\nIt is the same laptop that House Republicans have used in their investigations into the Biden family's shady foreign business dealings - and whether Joe Biden himself benefited from influence peddling while he was vice president.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss has brought the gun charges as well as tax offense charges against Hunter Biden. The Justice Department has been investigating the younger Biden for more than five years.\n\nThe laptop story is important because the way it was handled is far from an isolated incident.\n\nWhether it's Russian collusion in the 2016 election or the COVID-19 lab leak theory, Democrats and the legacy media often team together to form a narrative.\n\nAnd anyone who questions this determined narrative is considered fringe or even dangerous.\n\nTake for instance the claims of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign ahead of his 2016 victory. Democrats wouldn't let the accusation go and sought to taint Trump's entire presidency with allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nThe news media happily followed along.\n\nBias at NPR: NPR editor quit after telling the truth about liberal bias in media. It's time to defund them.\n\nThen last year, special counsel John Durham's damning report found that the FBI never had enough evidence to launch its investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nThat gave credence to Trump's claims of the whole thing being a \"hoax,\" much like his take about Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell.\"\n\nWe face another rematch between Trump and Biden in this election, and it will be even more contentious than before. Trump's recent conviction (a first for a former president) in his hush money trial and Hunter Biden's charges are adding to the drama. If convicted, Hunter would be the first child of a sitting president found guilty of a felony.\n\nThe American people need the truth more than ever - not the left's preferred narrative.\n\nWill they get it?\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

FBI agent Erika Jensen testified in court that the agency had verified the laptop as belonging to Hunter through its serial number and records from Apple, CNN reported.\n\nThe prosecution further shared images from the laptop and Hunter's iCloud account showing him half- or fully nude, holding crack pipes, and with a bong in the background.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jensen testified that no tampering had occurred with Hunter's laptop, replying \"no\" when asked by the prosecution on redirect if she had seen any evidence of tampering, according to Breitbart reporter Wendell Husebo.\n\nThe laptop's authenticity is important because many in President Joe Biden's camp attempted to discredit the Post's original reporting in October 2020. The computer revealed evidence that Hunter introduced his father - then vice president of the U.S. - to a Ukrainian businessman less than a year before Joe pressured Ukrainian government officials to fire a prosecutor investigating the businessman's company. This meeting took place a year after Hunter was inexplicably hired to the board of a Ukrainian energy firm and paid up to $50,000 a month.\n\nFollowing the Post's reporting, Big Tech companies, including Twitter (now X) and Facebook, worked to suppress the story. Documents released in December 2022 by X CEO Elon Musk revealed that the FBI paid Twitter millions of dollars for its \"legal process response.\" They repeatedly warned its company's executives to censor the story.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nIn addition to Big Tech censorship, 51 former intelligence officials signed a public letter claiming the laptop story had \"all the hallmarks\" of Russian disinformation. Those officials, including former CIA directors Michael Hayden and John Brennan, as well as ex-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, have refused to apologize or admit they were wrong.\n\nHunter is charged with lying on a form in order to purchase a handgun in October 2018. Because Hunter is a drug addict, he should have checked a box indicating such, and not doing so amounted to making a false statement material to a firearms sale and making a false statement in a firearms transaction record, Reuters reported. Those are the first two charges against Hunter. The third relates to Hunter violating a law banning drug users and addicts from possessing firearms.\n\nIn addition to the charges Hunter faces in Delaware, he is also accused of evading taxes in California.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person",

In prior court filings, Special Counsel David Weiss called their criticism of the laptop's authenticity a \"conspiracy theory with no supporting evidence.\"\n\nWhen asked by prosecutor Derek Hines if she had seen evidence that Hunter Biden's laptop had been tampered with, Jensen responded \"no,\" according to multiple reports.\n\nHunter Biden was indicted in September on felony gun charges for allegedly making false statements on a gun purchase form and knowingly possessing a gun while addicted to drugs. Prosecutors are using data from the laptop as evidence in the trial to demonstrate Hunter Biden was addicted to drugs at the time of purchase.\n\nAfter the New York Post first reported on the laptop's contents in 2020, former intelligence officials issued a public statement claiming it has \"all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" The outlet was censored on Twitter following its publication of the report. (RELATED: Special Counsel Says Hunter Biden's Lawyers Are Spinning 'Conspiracy Theory' By Questioning Laptop Authenticity)\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys previously argued that the laptop \"may have been tampered with by someone other than Mr. Biden,\" noting \"various media outlets\" that received copies of the data \"concluded it is not\" authentic. Prosecutors fired back in court filings that the data used during the trial was extracted directly by an FBI forensic specialist in 2019 rather than the copy of the data obtained by the media.\n\nJensen also clarified on the witness stand that some data came directly from Hunter Biden's iCloud account rather than the laptop itself, according to NBC News.\n\n\"The same 'Russian disinformation' once 'certified' by 51 former intelligence officials just days before an election is now being used by federal prosecutors as factual evidence against Hunter Biden,\" Republican Georgia Rep.

This is the first time that a child of a sitting U.S. president is on trial.\n\nHunter Biden, President Joe Biden's son, faces three charges related to gun possession while using narcotics in his criminal case. He has pleaded not guilty to making false statements while purchasing a firearm in October 2018 and to illegal gun possession while on drugs.\n\nOn the witness stand, Jensen discussed text messages and drug and gun purchasing evidence relating to Hunter Biden's laptop that he had left at a Delaware repair shop. Since 2020, his laptop has sparked controversy largely along partisan lines with Biden supporters calling it a \"smear campaign\" just days before the election and Republicans asserting that emails on his laptop show foreign business dealings.\n\nDuring cross-examination defense attorney Abbe Lowell asked Jensen, \"Did you find out whether any of the files had been tampered with?\" Jensen replied, \"I did not.\" In redirect, which is when the prosecution can question their witness after cross-examination, the prosecution asked if Jensen had seen any evidence of tampering, to which Jensen replied \"No.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out via email to Lowell for comment on Wednesday.\n\nFollowing Jensen's testimony, Republicans and MAGA supporters have taken to X, formerly Twitter, to celebrate the alleged lack of evidence of tampering and to mock Biden supporters who previously called into question the laptop's authenticity.\n\nThe House GOP Oversight Committee, chaired by Representative James Comer, posted a video of Democratic Representative Dan Goldman and journalist Michael Shellenberger discussing a \"conspiracy\" during a November 2023 hearing. Shortly after Jensen's testimony, the committee shared the caption, \"Rough day for Hunter Biden laptop deniers...\"\n\nFollowing today's testimony, the House committee along with the Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Ways and Means sent \"criminal referrals to the DOJ recommending Hunter and James Biden be charged with making false statements to Congress about key aspects of the impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden.\"\n\nUser @SteveLovesAmmo posted a video segment of an October 2020 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl and Donald Trump, where journalist Stahl said, \"We can't put on things we can't verify,\" in regards to the laptop. In his caption, Steve wrote, \"Will Trump ever get his apology?\"\n\n@Leslibless, whose X bio says she is a \"sister to 5 DoD brothers\" and \"firm conservative,\" posted a compilation video of Biden with various statements about the laptop. The caption reads: \"Just now in court, the FBI said the laptop was not altered in any way, and it's content is legitimate. It's just been introduced into evidence.\" The post has been reshared nearly 6,000 times, as of Wednesday evening.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

On the device, a sordid debate filled with sexual debauchery, drug use, and the blueprint for the Biden family influence-peddling operation that was damning for the Democrats' hopes of retaking the White House. The liberal media and Silicon Valley knew that too, which is why they buried the story and censored The New York Post, who first reported on the laptop, from posting on their social media accounts for days.\n\nThe attack line was predictable: the laptop was Russian disinformation. Conservative media knew it was authentic. It would take months for the rest of the establishment media to confirm what half the nation knew already. With Hunter Biden's gun trial underway, the laptop has been made a key piece of evidence by the government. So, is Russian disinformation no longer there? Trump said Biden was engulfed in scandal when he was interviewed by Stahl, who dismissed the notion. She wouldn't let Trump discuss the laptop, saying it couldn't be verified. Stahl owes Trump an apology, and the media owes the rest of us the same treatment for lying. I know -- we shouldn't hold our breath. No one has apologized for the Russian collusion hoax -- why should this be any different?\n\nOur own Mia Cathell is in Wilmington, Delaware, covering the trial, where FBI Agent Erika Jensen testified to the device's authenticity. Upon questioning, Jensen also re-confirmed its authenticity, saying the serial number matched the one provided by Apple. Of course, Hunter's attorneys tried to cast doubt, asking if the FBI felt the data had been tampered with.\n\n\"When we obtained the data, it was authentic from that point forward,\" Jensen said. The FBI obtained it in December 2019. Now, from the period when Hunter dropped the laptop at a repair shop in Wilmington to when the hard drive was copied by the shop's owner and delivered to Rudy Giuliani, who later turned it over to the New York Post, Jensen said she had \"no firsthand knowledge\" of what might have happened in that timeframe. But it's clear: the device is authentic. Even the corrupt, biased FBI said its contents were authentic.\n\nNever trust your debauched, cracked-out son to hold all the dirty secrets.

Then-President Donald Trump and candidate Joe Biden duked it out in their second and final presidential debate before the election.\n\nTrump made references to the recently published New York Post story about Hunter Biden's now-infamous laptop.\n\n\"They're calling it the laptop from hell,\" Trump said.\n\nHow right he was. The laptop just made an official appearance in federal court this week. More on that shortly.\n\nDuring the 2020 debate, Biden angrily defended his son (and himself), conveniently reciting a letter by so-called former intelligence officials penned just days before the debate: \"We do not know if the emails, provided to the New York Post by President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, are genuine or not.\"\n\n\"There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he's accusing me of is a Russian plant,\" Biden said. \"They have said that this has all the ... five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.\"\n\nCNN's response? It \"fact-checked\" whether Trump \"spread Russian disinformation during the debate.\"\n\nIt turns out the ones who were spreading garbage were Biden and these disinformation \"experts,\" who along with a complicit mainstream news media, quashed and discounted an important story just weeks before the presidential election.\n\nWhy am I bringing this up now?\n\nBecause the laptop showed up again this week in a federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, where Hunter Biden is being tried on three felony gun charges.\n\nIt turns out that the laptop that was once widely denounced is now being used as evidence by federal prosecutors to prove the president's son lied about his drug use on a gun form.\n\nIt's very real.\n\nAnd testimony from an FBI special agent reiterated that the FBI had the laptop in its possession in 2019 after Hunter Biden had deserted it at a repair shop.\n\nIt is the same laptop that House Republicans have used in their investigations into the Biden family's shady foreign business dealings - and whether Joe Biden himself benefited from influence peddling while he was vice president.\n\nSpecial counsel David Weiss has brought the gun charges as well as tax offense charges against Hunter Biden. The Justice Department has been investigating the younger Biden for more than five years.\n\nTrump convicted: Trump is guilty. It won't matter at all this election.\n\nThe laptop story is important because the way it was handled is far from an isolated incident.\n\nWhether it's Russian collusion in the 2016 election or the COVID-19 lab leak theory, Democrats and the legacy media often team together to form a narrative.\n\nAnd anyone who questions this determined narrative is considered fringe or even dangerous.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nTake for instance the claims of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign ahead of his 2016 victory. Democrats wouldn't let the accusation go and sought to taint Trump's entire presidency with allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nThe news media happily followed along.\n\nBias at NPR: NPR editor quit after telling the truth about liberal bias in media. It's time to defund them.\n\nThen last year, special counsel John Durham's damning report found that the FBI never had enough evidence to launch its investigation into the Trump campaign.\n\nThat gave credence to Trump's claims of the whole thing being a \"hoax,\" much like his take about Hunter Biden's \"laptop from hell.\"\n\nWe face another rematch between Trump and Biden in this election, and it will be even more contentious than before. Trump's recent conviction (a first for a former president) in his hush money trial and Hunter Biden's charges are adding to the drama. If convicted, Hunter would be the first child of a sitting president found guilty of a felony.\n\nThe American people need the truth more than ever - not the left's preferred narrative.\n\nWill they get it?\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Meanwhile, Facebook temporarily reduced the reach of posts containing stories about the laptop until it could be verified by independent fact checkers.\n\nAccording to reporting from the Atlantic, Facebook's decision to limit distribution of the story was based on an FBI warning that social media companies watch for disinformation in the weeks leading up to the election. That fact was seized upon in a House Judiciary Committee letter to FBI Christopher Wray last year, with lawmakers questioning why the FBI refused to verify the authenticity of the laptop despite knowledge that the device was not part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\n\"The FBI's failure to alert social-media companies that the Hunter Biden laptop was real, and not mere Russian disinformation, is particularly troubling,\" the letter to Wray read. \"The FBI had the laptop in their possession since December 2019 and had warned social-media companies to look for a 'hack and dump' operation by the Russians prior to the 2020 election. Even after Facebook specifically asked whether the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation, Dehmlow of the FBI refused to comment, resulting in the social-media companies' suppression of the story. As a result, millions of U.S. citizens did not hear the story prior to the November 3, 2020 election.\"\n\nNEW YORK TIMES FINALLY CONFIRMS HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP AFTER DISMISSING IT AMID 2020 CAMPAIGN\n\nOutlets such as the New York Times and Washington Post would later publish their own analysis of the laptop, finding nearly two years later that the contents of the device were real and not the result of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nNevertheless, Wray defended the FBI in a congressional hearing shortly before receiving the Judiciary Committee letter last year, calling accusations that the bureau favored the Biden family \"ludicrous.\"\n\n\"The work the men and women of the FBI do to protect the American people goes way beyond one or two investigations that seem to capture all the headlines,\" Wray said at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut Wray refused to engage in specific questions about the investigation into Biden, a policy of silence that has persisted into the present day, with the bureau referring Fox News Digital's questions about the laptop to the special counsel's office.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden laptop controversy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Turley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Turley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Newsroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "America's Newsroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fact-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

They can't now", "body": "By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.\n\nWatching the coverage this week out of Delaware was like finding oneself in a parallel universe. There were ABC, NBC, CBS, the Washington Post and other news outlets reporting matter-of-factly that the Hunter Biden laptop showed no evidence of tampering and was both real and authentic.\n\nThese are the same outlets, and some of the same reporters, who eagerly spread the false claims that the laptop was \"Russian disinformation.\"\n\nYet, what followed the testimony of FBI agent Erika Jensen was absolute crickets. There was no effort to track down the signatories of the now-debunked letter from former intelligence officials just before the election. In the letter, figures such as Leon Panetta, former CIA director in the Obama administration, claimed that the letter had all the markings of a Russian disinformation effort by intelligence services. (Panetta continued to make the assertion even in late 2023 in pushing what the federal government is now calling a \"conspiracy theory.\")\n\nHUNTER BIDEN TRIAL ENTERS DAY 4 AFTER WILD TESTIMONY FROM EXES ON RAMPANT DRUG USE, TRASHED HOTEL ROOMS\n\nThere was no attempt by the media to confront associates of the Biden campaign (including now Secretary of State Antony Blinken) who pushed a long effort to get former intelligence officials to sign a letter.\n\nThere was no attempt to question President Joe Biden, who made this false claim in the presidential election to deflect any questions about the evidence of corrupt influence peddling on the laptop.\n\nYears ago, I wrote that the Biden campaign had pulled off the single greatest political trick in history. As I wrote back then, the key to this Houdini-esque trick was to get the media to invest in the deception like audience members called to the stage.\n\nHoudini used to make his elephant Jennifer disappear on stage every night because he knew that the audience wanted her to disappear. They were part of the act. The Bidens made the media part of the act, and these reporters have to back the illusion or admit that they were part of the deception.\n\nThey are all laptop deniers, but they know that there are few who will call them to account for their conspiracy theory. Rather, it is social media where readers can see videos of leading media claiming that the laptop is the work of Russian intelligence.\n\nIn 2020, CBS News' Lesley Stahl literally laughed mockingly at then-President Donald Trump when he raised the Hunter Biden laptop and what it revealed about the Bidens.\n\nFigures like former Chief of State at the CIA and Department of Defense Jeremy Bash, who told MSNBC that the laptop \"looked like Russian intelligence\" and \"walked like Russian intelligence.\" He dismissed the relevance of the laptop before the election by declaring that \"this effort by Rudy Giuliani and the New York Post and Steve Bannon to cook up supposed dirt on Joe Biden looks like a classic, Russian playbook disinformation campaign.\"\n\nBash added that it made Trump an effective agent of Russian intelligence since he kept referencing the laptop: \"[when] Rudy Giuliani suddenly comes forward with these mysteriously created emails, probably hacked through a Russian intelligence operation, we have to acknowledge the fact that the President of the United States is supporting, is condoning, is welcoming a Russian intelligence operation in 2020. ... This is collusion in plain sight.\"\n\nBash, like others behind the conspiracy theory, was later given an intelligence position by Biden.\n\nCNN's Alex Marquardt told viewers, \"We do know it is a very active Russian campaign.\"\n\nIndeed, the Washington Post has continued to suggest that this reporting was accurate. One of the leading purveyors of this false story was the Post's Philip Bump, who slammed the New York Post for its now proven Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nIn 2021, when media organizations were finally admitting that the laptop was authentic, Bump was still declaring that it was a \"conspiracy theory.\" Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Bump continued to suggest that \"the laptop was seeded by Russian intelligence.\"\n\nAfter Bump had a meltdown in an interview when confronted over past false claims, I wrote a column about the litany of such false claims. The Post surprised many of us by issuing a statement that they stood by all of Bump's reporting, including the laptop conspiracy theory. That was in August 2023.\n\nOf course, this trick would not have been possible without the assistance of 50 former intelligence officials who were reportedly organized through Clinton campaign associates to issue the infamous letter.\n\nThese figures then continued to spread the false claim.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan, one of the 50 who signed the letter, also claimed that the laptop bore \"the hallmarks of Russian disinformation.\"\n\nJames Clapper, a former director of National Intelligence and CNN analyst, said the laptop was \"classic, textbook Soviet, Russian tradecraft at work.\"\n\nMembers of Congress also repeated the false claims, including Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., who told the media not to join Giuliani as a \"vehicle for Russian disinformation.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, insisted that the laptop was clearly \"Kremlin propaganda.\"\n\nThis long-debunked claim was even recently repeated in Congress by Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who claimed that the laptop could not be authenticated even though it was just authenticated and introduced in a federal prosecution.\n\nAll of those who pushed what the U.S. government is now calling a false \"conspiracy theory\" have flourished in the wake of Biden's victory. Intelligence officials like Bash received plum positions while others like Clapper were given media contracts. Schiff is expected to be elected to the Senate and is running, ironically enough, on his record with intelligence investigations of Trump.\n\nAfter Bump had a meltdown in an interview when confronted over past false claims, I wrote a column about the litany of such false claims. The Post surprised many of us by issuing a statement that they stood by all of Bump's reporting, including the laptop conspiracy theory. That was in August 2023.\n\nConversely, the New York Post and reporters like Miranda Devine have received no recognition for their work in disclosing the contents and defying attacks from politicians and media alike. While reporters were given a Pulitzer for reporting the now debunked Russian collusion story, Devine and others will never receive a Pulitzer for uncovering the true story behind the laptop.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDevine, the New York Post, and others simply refused to get in on the trick. As is often said, there are some facts simply \"too good to check\" in the media. The Hunter Biden laptop disappeared from the stage like Houdini's elephant because the media wanted it to disappear.\n\nThe reappearance of the laptop in a Delaware courtroom might be awkward for most people, but not the media or intelligence officials or politicians who pushed the conspiracy theory. After all, they were all in on the trick.

The device was filled with sexual debauchery, drug use, and the blueprint for the Biden family influence-peddling operation that was damning for the Democrats' hopes of retaking the White House. The liberal media and Silicon Valley knew that too, which is why they buried the story and censored The New York Post, who first reported on the laptop, from posting on their social media accounts for days.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nThe attack line was predictable: the laptop was Russian disinformation. Conservative media knew it was authentic. It would take months for the rest of the establishment media to confirm what half the nation knew already. With Hunter Biden's gun trial underway, the laptop has been made a key piece of evidence by the government. So, is Russian disinformation no longer there? Trump said Biden was engulfed in scandal when he was interviewed by Stahl, who dismissed the notion. She wouldn't let Trump discuss the laptop, saying it couldn't be verified. Stahl owes Trump an apology, and the media owes the rest of us the same treatment for lying. I know -- we shouldn't hold our breath. No one has apologized for the Russian collusion hoax -- why should this be any different?\n\nVideo of Stahl as the perfect Democratic Party operative with a lavalier at above link.

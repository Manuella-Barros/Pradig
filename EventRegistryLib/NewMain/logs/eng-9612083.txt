China earlier this month began enforcing an annual four-month fishing ban in the contested waters.\n\n\"The new policy of threatening to detain our own citizens, that is different. That is an escalation of the situation. So, yes, it is now very worrisome,\" Marcos told reporters, according to a statement released by his communications office.\n\nMarcos was speaking in Brunei, where he wrapped up a state visit before going to Singapore, where he is scheduled to give a keynote speech on Friday at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a high-level international security conference.\n\nMarcos is expected to highlight the South China Sea during his speech in Singapore. Top political and security leaders from dozens of countries, including from rival superpowers the United States and China, are expected to attend the Shangri-La meetings.\n\n'Illegal' order\n\nOn May 15, the Chinese coast guard issued an order authorizing its personnel to detain for up to 30 days -- and 60 days, in some cases -- foreign boats and nationals suspected of trespassing in South China Sea waters claimed by Beijing.\n\nManila hit back days later, calling the order \"illegal\" and warning against repercussions if it was implemented.\n\nThe Philippines has also formally protested this year's fishing ban by China.\n\nThe four-month fishing moratorium began on May 1 and is to last until Sept. 16 in areas in the South China Sea that are \"north of the 12 degrees North latitude.\" That includes waters considered to be part of Manila's exclusive economic zone.\n\nFilipino fishermen have threatened to defy the detention order, and the Philippine Coast Guard said it was ready to aid them in case they were harassed.\n\nChina said the new policy aims to standardize law enforcement and better uphold maritime order.\n\n\"It is consistent with universal practices. Individuals and entities have no need for concern as long as they have not done anything illicit,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said during a regular press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"[It] is the Philippines, not China, that has escalated the situation and made repeated provocations in the South China Sea,\" she told reporters.\n\n\"China's door of dialogue and communication with the Philippines remains open, but it's important to note that dialogue requires sincerity and whatever is agreed in dialogue must be acted upon, rather than talking about the need for dialogue while continuing to make provocations.\"\n\nBack-channel efforts\n\nIn Brunei, Marcos said Manila was pursuing back-channel efforts with China to try and cool down bilateral tensions over the waterway, especially in Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal, also known as the Ayungin Shoal, which both countries claim.\n\nThe shoals lie within Manila's exclusive economic zone, but Beijing lately has been intercepting Filipino boats trying to reach waters around them.\n\n\"You should try everything. You don't know what effort is going to be successful,\" Marcos said.\n\n\"So, [at] any point of contact that I can establish, I will use it, and at every level -- at the leaders' level, at the ministerial, sub-ministerial, private [levels] -- as long as it gives us, brings us progress in terms of resolving these [territorial problems],\" he said.\n\n\"And if we can get to that, then we can move to the next step and to see if there is a way to resolve all these claims, and so that we can all go about our business in a peaceful way and continue to try and develop our countries,\" he said. \"There are always, always efforts at every level.\"\n\nThe Philippines, China, Malaysia, Brunei and Vietnam as well as Taiwan have competing claims in the South China Sea.\n\n'A significant recalibration'\n\nMarcos' upcoming speech in Singapore reflects how the international community is keeping a close eye on the South China Sea, considered a geopolitical flashpoint, according to an expert based in Manila.\n\nMany countries are watching the Philippines because \"the country is undergoing a significant recalibration of its foreign and security policy,\" geopolitical analyst Don McLain Gill told BenarNews.\n\n\"Manila intends to play an active role in securing the established order in the Indo-Pacific through securing its sovereignty and sovereign rights based on international law,\" he said.\n\nBut while it would significantly increase Marcos' profile, his speech is unlikely to be \"a game changer for China's policy trajectory towards Manila,\" Gill said.\n\nChina claims historical rights over most of the South China Sea, although a landmark international arbitration ruling in 2016, in a case brought by Manila against Beijing, rejected those claims entirely.\n\nJeoffrey Maitem contributed to this report from Manila.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Dong Jun.\n\nThe Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a \"red line\" would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor.\n\n\"If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,\" he replied.\n\n\"And our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,\" he added.\n\nChina has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.\n\nWith confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty.\n\nAs part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is \"iron-clad\" and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it.\n\nThat raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally - and even drag the US military into a conflict.\n\n\"We already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,\" Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China's coast guard ships.\n\n\"But once we get to that point (a fatality)... we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,\" he said.\n\nKey global waterway\n\nChina claims \"indisputable sovereignty\" over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea - one of the world's busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines.\n\nIn 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China's claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis.\n\nBut Beijing has rejected the tribunal's ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China's mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels - which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors.\n\nMarcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\" he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it's sovereignty to \"the last square millimeter.\"\n\n\"The life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\" he added.\n\nIn the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA.\n\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are \"in line with common international practices.\"\n\n\"As long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,\" spokesperson Mao Ning said.\n\n\"What I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,\" Ning added.\n\nIn his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"The strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states.

Both countries are important.\"\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, is a key focus of Washington's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region as it seeks to counter China's growing military might and influence.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the United States in the event of any conflict.\n\nThe Philippines expanded a 2014 agreement last year to give US military access to another four of its bases, taking the total to nine, including two in the far north of the country less than 450 kilometres (280 miles) from Taiwan.\n\nThe Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement allows US troops to rotate through and store defence equipment and supplies.\n\nThe United States' growing presence in the region and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea have infuriated China's leaders in Beijing.\n\nChina has accused the United States of using the Philippines as a \"pawn to stir up trouble in the South China Sea\".\n\n- 'Illegal, coercive, aggressive' -\n\nManila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes, but tensions have worsened under Marcos.\n\nIn an effort to win international backing for its stance, Manila has published images of incidents involving Chinese and Philippine vessels, and invited local and foreign media on its patrol boats.\n\nChina Coast Guard vessels have used water cannon against Philippine boats multiple times in the contested waters, where there have also been collisions that injured several Filipino troops.\n\nBeijing defends its actions as \"legitimate\" and \"necessary law enforcement measures\" in response to Philippine vessels that it says have illegally entered its territorial waters.\n\nChina claims almost the entire waterway, brushing off rival claims from other countries, including the Philippines, and ignoring an international ruling that its claims have no legal basis.\n\nTo assert its stance, Beijing deploys coast guard and other boats to patrol the waters and has turned several reefs into artificial islands that it has militarised.\n\nMany of the confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have happened near Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands.\n\nThe reef, where a handful of Filipino troops are garrisoned on a grounded navy vessel, is about 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan, and more than 1,000 kilometres from China's nearest major landmass, Hainan island.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,\" Marcos said Friday.\n\n\"I do not intend to yield,\" he said. \"Filipinos do not yield\".", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Dong Jun.\n\nThe Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a \"red line\" would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor.\n\n\"If a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,\" he replied.\n\n\"And our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,\" he added.\n\nChina has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon.\n\nWith confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty.\n\nAs part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is \"iron-clad\" and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it.\n\nThat raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally - and even drag the US military into a conflict.\n\n\"We already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,\" Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China's coast guard ships.\n\n\"But once we get to that point (a fatality)... we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,\" he said.\n\nA China Coast Guard vessel sails close to a Philippines ship during a day of clashes in the South China Sea, March 5, 2024\n\nRebecca Wright/CNN\n\nKey global waterway\n\nChina claims \"indisputable sovereignty\" over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea - one of the world's busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines.\n\nIn 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China's claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis.\n\nBut Beijing has rejected the tribunal's ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China's mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels - which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors.\n\nMarcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\" he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it's sovereignty to \"the last square millimeter.\"\n\n\"The life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\" he added.\n\nIn the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA.\n\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are \"in line with common international practices.\"\n\n\"As long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,\" spokesperson Mao Ning said.\n\n\"What I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,\" Ning added.\n\nIn his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"The strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. This contest is exacerbating flashpoints, it has created new security dilemmas,\" Marcos told delegates.\n\n\"The continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that

Filipinos do not yield.\" China has rejected the Philippines claims and the tribunal's ruling. As Marcos spoke, it was not immediately clear if China's defence minister, Dong Jun, had taken his seat at a head table in the audience. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was present, scheduled to take a seat between Marcos and Indonesian president-elect Prabowo Subianto.\n\nSince taking office two years ago, Marcos has adopted a more assertive approach toward defending its claims, prompting clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels at places like Second Thomas Shoal. In a move that took some allies by surprise, Marcos has also tightly embraced his nation's decades-old military partnership with the US, opening up new military facilities to American personnel, expanding joint military exercises and improving ties with US allies like Japan and Australia.\n\nAfter years in which Marcos' predecessor Rodrigo Duterte distanced the Philippines from the US in a bid to win more support from China, the shift has been welcomed by the Biden administration. The Philippines is in a strategic spot as it is near two potential flash points: Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nEncounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent during the past year as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone. China's coast guard has stepped up so-called \"grey-zone\" activities such as use of water cannons, collisions and ramming tactics to try to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions. It has also deployed fishing boats that the Philippines and its allies consider militia.\n\nMarcos called security in the South China Sea, through which a huge volume of trade passes, a global issue. Later, a reporter asked Marcos whether China would be crossing a \"red line\" if one of its coast guard ships killed a Filipino with water cannons. \"If a Filipino citizen was killed by a wilful act, that is very close to what we define as an act of war,\" Marcos replied. \"We would have crossed the Rubicon.

Unfortunately, this vision remains for now, a distant reality. Illegal coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nAn international tribunal dismissed China\u2019s territorial and maritime claims to the South China Sea in 2016 as having no legal basis, but Beijing rejected the ruling and continued to build outposts on islands and atolls that it controls.\n\nWithout specifically referring to China, Marcos also warned that countries that tried to apply their domestic laws outside their territorial jurisdiction, \u201cviolate international law, exacerbate tensions and undermine regional peace and security\u201d.\n\nHe also said the Philippines had tried to resolve maritime disputes legally in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to attempts to \u201cpropagate excessive and baseless claims through force, intimidation, and deception\u201d.\n\nResponding to questions after his speech, Marcos alluded to the recent clashes with Chinese ships, warning that the death of any Philippine coastguards \u201cwill be very close to what we define as an act of war\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe already have suffered injuries, but thank God, we have not yet gotten to the point of any civilian \u2026 being killed, but once we get to that point, it certainly would cross the Rubicon River, is that a red line? Almost certainly it\u2019s going to be a red line.\u201d\n\nMarcos has taken a tougher approach towards China in the South China Sea since taking office two years ago.\n\nThe country has moved to strengthen its military relations with the US by stepping up joint exercises and holding its first three-way drills with Japan and America.\n\nHe said Manila rejects \u201cany attempt to deny strategic agencies, especially by force that seek to subordinate our interests to anyone else\u2019s\u201d.\n\nChina claims most of the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway, but the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims.\n\nWhile the US does not have any territorial claims in the disputed waters, it is committed to upholding freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and supporting its southeast Asian allies, such as the Philippines.\n\nMarcos said the \u201cstabilising presence of the United States is crucial to regional peace\u201d but rejected the idea that his country had to make a choice between America and China, adding that both countries had to \u201cmanage [their] rivalry in a responsible manner\u201d.\n\nThe three-day conference in Singapore also included a meeting between Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun and his US counterpart Lloyd Austin, which Beijing described as \u201cpositive, practical and constructive\u201d.

Marcos Jr, on Friday said that the presence of the United States was \"crucial to regional peace\", as the Southeast Asian country faces growing Chinese pressure in waters off its coastline. Marcos has sought to deepen defense cooperation with the United States as he stands up to Chinese actions in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely. \"China's determining influence over the security situation and the economic evolution of this region is a permanent fact,\" Marcos said in a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, a major security forum attended by defense ministers from around the world. \"At the same time, the stabilizing presence of the United States is crucial to regional peace. It's never a choice. Both countries are important.\" The Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, is a key focus of Washington's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region as it seeks to counter China's growing military might and influence. Given its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the United States in the event of any conflict. The Philippines expanded a 2014 agreement last year to give US military access to another four of its bases, taking the total to nine, including two in the far north of the country less than 450 kilometers (280 miles) from Taiwan. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement allows US troops to rotate through and store defense equipment and supplies. The United States' growing presence in the region and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea have infuriated China's leaders in Beijing. China has accused the United States of using the Philippines as a \"pawn to stir up trouble in the South China Sea\". Manila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes, but tensions have worsened under Marcos. In an effort to win international backing for its stance, Manila has published images of incidents involving Chinese and Philippine vessels, and invited local and foreign media on its patrol boats. China Coast Guard vessels have used water cannon against Philippine boats multiple times in the contested waters, where there have also been collisions that injured several Filipino troops. Beijing defends its actions as \"legitimate\" and \"necessary law enforcement measures\" in response to Philippine vessels that it says have illegally entered its territorial waters. China claims almost the entire waterway, brushing off rival claims from other countries, including the Philippines, and ignoring an international ruling that its claims have no legal basis. To assert its stance, Beijing deploys coast guard and other boats to patrol the waters and has turned several reefs into artificial islands that it has militarized. Many of the confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have happened near Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands. The reef, where a handful of Filipino troops are garrisoned on a grounded navy vessel, is about 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan, and more than 1,000 kilometres from China's nearest major landmass, Hainan island. \"Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,\" Marcos said Friday. \"I do not intend to yield,\" he said. \"Filipinos do not yield\".", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biden called from Air Force One two days after the election, holding a friendly ten-minute exchange with Marcos that \"really set the tone for our relationship with the United States,\" Romualdez said.\n\nThe tone, from the US perspective, desperately needed changing. Rodrigo Duterte, who preceded Marcos had tilted away from Washington and repeatedly questioned the Southeast Asian nation's decades-old alliance with the US.\n\nYet even American officials have been surprised by just how much Marcos has shifted the Philippines back toward the US since he took office roughly two years ago. While Marcos in no way wants to be seen as a US pawn, one official said, he was disillusioned by China's actions in the South China Sea and is fully on board with strengthening ties with Washington.\n\n\"Many expected Marcos to shift back toward the Philippines' traditional close ties with the US,\" said Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C. think tank. \"But he has gone much farther, undertaking a generational modernization of the alliance to defend against Chinese aggression.\"\n\nMarcos' outspoken pushback on China, highlighted by his efforts to publicise confrontations between the two countries in the South China Sea, has turned him into somewhat of a star among the US and its allies. He had the rare honor of addressing the Australian parliament, and on Friday, he'll deliver the keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security conference in Singapore that brings together defense chiefs from the US, China and other nations.\n\n\"I can feel it in DC, you know,\" Romualdez said, where he's based. \"He's really the most sought after leader now, worldwide and in the United States,\" the envoy said.\n\nThe West's embrace of Marcos is a remarkable shift from his family's pariah status after his father was ousted from power almost four decades ago. Some observers initially thought he would hold a grudge against the Americans for prompting his family's exile to Hawaii after the 1986 revolt that ended his father's dictatorship.\n\nBiden's phone call to Marcos in May 2022 was soon followed by high-profile visits from the US secretaries of state and defense, as his administration made it a priority to revive longstanding alliances in a bid to compete with China. Biden met Marcos on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September of that year, and two months later his vice president was in Manila.\n\nWithin six months of his inauguration, Marcos had completed an almost total overhaul of Manila's policy towards the US - and by extension, China. Shortly afterward, he handed Washington's military planners something they greatly coveted: access to four additional bases in the Philippines, three close to Taiwan.\n\nDuterte had largely ignored a 2016 ruling by a UN-backed tribunal that had declared China's expansive claims illegal, aiming instead for better relations with Beijing - a position Marcos appeared to back on the campaign trail.\n\nBut Marcos shifted course once in office, repeatedly citing the 2016 ruling and putting the blame on Beijing for boosting tensions. China claims much of the South China Sea for itself, has built military facilities over reclaimed disputed areas and has conducted large military exercises near Taiwan.\n\n\"We have not instigated any kind of conflict. We have not instigated any kind of confrontation,\" Marcos told Bloomberg in a March interview. Since the threat from China has grown, he said, \"we must do more to defend our territory.\"\n\nEarly into his term, Marcos appeared to want to balance ties as much as possible. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in January 2023 on a state visit to Beijing, where the two leaders amicably discussed maritime differences and restarted talks on oil and gas exploration.\n\nBut everything changed a few weeks later. During a visit by Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Pentagon announced it had secured access to four additional bases in the Philippines, reinvigorating their decades-old military ties.\n\n\"It was seen by Beijing as positioning the US to interfere in the Taiwan contingency because of the location,\" said Ngeow Chow Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya. \"It was very hard for Beijing to feel that the Marcos government had any good intention.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expanded military deal was announced, the gloves came off. On Feb. 14, 2023, the Philippines protested China's flaring of a military-grade laser on a Coast Guard vessel, temporarily blinding the crew and forcing it to retreat.\n\nSince then, dangerous encounters in the South China Sea have become increasingly routine. Beijing's armada of fishing boats and Coast Guard vessels have often blocked Philippine ships and even collided with them, raising the risk of a conflict with China that could potentially draw in the US.\n\nChina has repeatedly warned the Philippines about involving \"external forces\" into their dispute, while maintaining that its maritime actions are reasonable and professional.\n\nThe US and its allies have given the Philippines steadfast diplomatic support, while providing it with real-time intelligence. US planes routinely circle overhead on Philippine resupply missions to a dilapidated World War II-era ship that serves as a military outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe US recently assembled a grouping privately called the \"Squad\" with the Philippines, Australia and Japan to conduct maritime drills and provide greater security assistance to Manila. The Philippines is also working on troop visits with France, in addition to deals with Japan and Australia. In recent weeks, it conducted one of the largest joint exercises ever with the US.\n\nManila is hoping to leverage the enhanced military relationship to win more US investment and diversify from China, its top trading partner.\n\nThe US recently promised $1 billion in tech and energy investments, and a deal to boost the Philippines' role in the nickel supply chain to cut China's dominance is also under discussion. The US and Japan have also committed to build rails, ports and factors in a so-called \"economic corridor\" on the Philippines' main island.\n\n\"Our alliance with the United States has become stronger, bolstered by our economic engagements,\" Marcos said last month during his fourth trip to the US in two years.\n\nMarcos has sought to use the clashes in the South China Sea to his advantage, inviting media from across the world to view China's actions. And that strategy is showing some signs of paying off, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\"Some of the PRC's behaviour at sea may have become more careful and restrained as a result of the Philippines' efforts,\" he said, using an acronym for China. \"This suggests that amid the friction and intensifying differences, even Beijing wishes to be able to manage escalation and is acting more carefully than it otherwise could.\"", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"},

We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\" he said.\n\n\"As President, I have sworn to this solemn commitment from the very first day that I took office. I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield,\" he added.\n\nHe denounced aggressive actions in the maritime area that run counter to ASEAN's vision of a safe and stable South China Sea.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\" he said.\n\n\"We have defined our territory and maritime zones in a manner befitting a responsible and law-abiding member of the international community. We have submitted our assertions to rigorous, legal scrutiny by the world's leading jurors,\" he asserted.\n\nPresident Marcos cited the 1982 UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award, which affirmed the Philippines' maritime rights and rejected China's massive claim in the SCS.\n\nThe President also called on the United States and China to manage their rivalry \"in a responsible manner.\"\n\n\"China's determining influence over the security situation and the economic evolution of this region is permanent. At the same time, the stabilizing presence of America is crucial to regional peace. It's never a choice. Both countries are important,\" Mr. Marcos said.\n\n\"The continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that rivalry in a responsible manner.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Armed Forces chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr. said the Philippines and the United States have expressed concern over Beijing's new policy to arrest trespassers the South China Sea.\n\n\"Both our countries are concerned about it,\" Brawner said at the sidelines of the defense summit in Singapore.\n\nDays before his back-to-back trip to Brunei and Singapore, Mr. Marcos condemned China's order to arrest any foreign nationals trespassing in the South China Sea, which includes areas that fall under the Philippines' exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea.\n\n\"That kind of action would be completely unacceptable to the Philippines,\" he said.\n\n\"That is unacceptable, and we will take whatever measures to always protect our citizens,\" Mr. Marcos added.\n\nChina said the Philippines should not be worried about the new rules \"as long there is no illegal behavior.\"\n\nBrawner said the government is also monitoring China's deployment of bigger ships in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nChina Coast Guard 5901, the largest coast guard ship in the world known as \"The Monster,\" earlier conducted an \"intrusive patrol\" near Scarborough Shoal.\n\nScarborough Shoal, also called Bajo de Masinloc or Panatag Shoal, is located within the Philippines' EEZ.\n\nForeign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, for his part, discussed the Law of the Sea with an international lawyer at a sideline meeting of the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue.\n\nManalo said he was able to meet Prof. Robert Beckman, at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\"Hopeful that our discussion on International Law, including the Law Of The Sea, could pave the way for further collaboration, (especially) among the many centers of expertise in our region,\" the country's top diplomat said.\n\nThe meeting came a day after the Department of Justice said the environmental case the Philippine government intends to file against China over the maritime destruction in the West Philippine Sea may be completed \"in a few weeks.\"\n\nThe National Security Council earlier said the evidence includes images of how Chinese activities destroyed the already fragile marine environment in Scarborough Shoal.\n\nJustice Secretary Jesus Remulla first broached the idea of filing a case against China in September 2023 after the Armed Forces of the Philippines Western Command confirmed there were cases of massive coral harvesting along Rozul (Iroquois) Reef in the WPS.\n\nThe Philippines is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the government has since pushed for international rules-based order, especially on regional tensions and conflicts.", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Marcos, Jr. said countries outside the region should consider tensions in the South China Sea as a major issue for their economies, citing the waterway's importance to international trade.\n\nHe made the remarks ahead of the premier summit of defense leaders and analysts across the world, and as China pushes policies seen restricting access to one of the world's most important waterways.\n\n\"It's so important to international trade that we can actually say that the stakeholders are no longer limited to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Asia, Indo-Pacific. It really involves the global economy already,\" Mr. Marcos told reporters, based on a transcript from his office.\n\nHe said he would highlight the government's position amid tensions in the South China Sea and \"see the ways forward for the Philippines and for the region.\"\n\n\"The fact that they asked the Philippine President to come and speak on that very subject is significant in the sense that it is a recognition that there are challenges facing the Philippines, specifically,\" he said.\n\nChina has been blocking Philippine government and civic missions within Manila's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Scarborough Shoal, a traditional fishing ground, and Second Thomas Shoal, in which a Filipino military outpost was established in 1999, have been among South China Sea features most frequented by Chinese Coast Guard vessels last year.\n\nThe Philippines has also been reporting increasing Chinese presence in features near Reed Bank, a large tablemount in the waterway that according to the US Energy Information Administration could hold up to 5.4 billion barrels of oil and 55.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nAs the country deals with the potential depletion of its sole indigenous source of natural gas -- the Malampaya gas field, there's been growing focus on the waterway's economic importance.\n\nTwo Philippine tycoons recently backed the government's efforts to defend the country's claims in the waterway, with San Miguel Corp. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President Ramon S. Ang citing its vast energy potential.\n\n\"We have a big reserve in the West Philippine Sea,\" he said at a government economic briefing earlier this week, referring to parts of the South China Sea that fall within the Philippine EEZ.\n\nManny V. Pangilinan, chairman and CEO of Manila Electric Co. (Meralco), said Mr. Marcos \"has been making the right decisions\" amid tensions with China.\n\n\"We fully support what he's been doing,\" he said last month.\n\nPXP Energy Corp., which is chaired by Mr. Pangilinan, has struggled conducting drilling and exploration activities for its Reed Bank concession or Service Contract 72.\n\nVITAL TO TRADE\n\nJoshua Bernard B. Espena, vice-president at Manila-based International Development and Security Cooperation, said the Philippines is on the right track of \"internationalizing\" the dispute with China since the South China Sea is vital to international trade.\n\nHe said China keeps on insisting that disputes in the waterway should only involve claimants, but the Marcos government has \"resisted\" and kept doing what it needed to do -- \"unilateral and minilateral approaches to contain Chinese excessive moves so that the Philippines might stand to gain amid geopolitical shifts.\"\n\n\"This is vital given the limitations on the Philippines' capability to protect its fishers and deny Chinese arrests,\" he said in a Facebook Messenger chat.\n\nOn the other hand, Ateneo de Manila University economics professor Leonardo A. Lanzona said the Marcos administration's South China Sea policy may be \"frightening investment out of the Philippines.\"\n\n\"The exodus of firms from China because of these geopolitical issues is unlikely to benefit the country since the government has put the Philippines at the center of this tension,\" he said via Messenger chat.\n\n\"Southeast Asian countries even closer to China, such as Thailand and Vietnam, are taking advantage of this situation as the firms exiting China are moving into their borders,\" he said, noting that these countries are unlikely to get involved in the issue.\n\nMr. Lanzona said Manila should maintain stable diplomatic ties with China even as it defends its sovereignty and \"most importantly focus on making our industry more attractive to investors.\"\n\nThe Philippines has gained strong international support after it launched a transparency campaign last year that seeks to expose China's aggressive acts within the Philippine EEZ such as the use of water cannons and dangerous maneuvers.\n\nMr. Marcos is set to deliver a keynote message for the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 31.\n\nBeijing recently announced a four-month fishing ban in the entire waterway, just weeks after it adopted a policy authorizing its coast guard to detain foreigners it suspects of violating its exit-entry rules \"in the waters under the jurisdiction of China\" for up to 30 days -- and in some cases for as long as 60 days -- without a trial.\n\nThe Philippine military on Thursday said it had prepared contingency plans amid China's fishing ban and new coast guard policy, which it said will be handled by law enforcement agencies such as the Philippine Coast Guard.\n\n\"We have contingency plans in place,\" Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo Serbisyo, noting that Manila regularly conducts patrols within the Philippine EEZ.\n\n\"We also have additional resources that are available and on standby.\"\n\nA group of fishermen from Zambales, Pangasinan, Bataan and Palawan provinces said their fishing rights are continuously \"threatened by harassment and intimidation from China's coast guard and maritime militia who are keeping Filipinos away from the rich waters.\"\n\nWhile the Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources provide them effective protection, the government needs to step up efforts to provide \"economic support services\" to affected fishers \"who are mostly neglected and left on their own with little state benefits,\" they said in a statement.\n\nJohn Paolo R. Rivera, president and chief economist at Oikonomia Advisory & Research, Inc., said the South China Sea \"will be an economic issue if the situation poses economic impacts to countries involved.\"\n\nOver $3 trillion worth of trade passes annually through the South China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said Manila is well-positioned to forge more economic partnerships with friendly nations amid increasing tensions with China.\n\nChina is the Philippines' largest source of imports and second-largest export market. On the other hand, the United States, a major defense ally that has backed Manila amid Beijing's intrusions at sea, is the largest destination of Philippine products and the fifth-largest source of imports.\n\nA recent report from Nomura Global Markets Research said geopolitical concerns from the South China Sea dispute \"could be an impediment to Chinese companies looking to diversify supply chains into the Philippines.\"\n\nPhilip Arnold \"Randy\" P. Tua\u00f1o, dean of the Ateneo School of Government, said via Messenger chat the expected establishment of an economic corridor on the main island of Luzon will help Manila in its efforts to diversify the country's trade ties away from China.", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In response, China's coastguard said it had taken necessary measures against Philippine vessels intruding in its waters.\n\nEarlier that month, the China Coast Guard was accused of a water cannon attack that left four Filipino crew members injured by broken glass.\n\nManila deploys resupply missions to the shoal to supply a small garrison of troops living aboard an aging warship deliberately run aground in 1999 to protect Manila's maritime claims.\n\nBeijing claims almost all of the South China Sea as its waters, despite a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that said that China's claims has no basis under international law. China has refused to recognize that outcome.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Marcos cited treaties including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, which established a legal framework for all marine and maritime activities.\n\nMarcos said that UNCLOS also clarified the limits of each state's maritime zones, and defined the extent with which they could exercise sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction over those zones. The Philippines, he pointed out, had made a \"conscious effort to align our definition of our territory and our maritime zones with what international law permits and recognizes.\"\n\nHe said that \"our efforts stand in stark contrast to assertive actions that aim to propagate excessive and baseless claims through force, intimidation and deception,\" although he did not name China directly.\n\nMarcos said that the country was defending the integrity of UNCLOS as the constitution of the oceans, adding that the country has defined its territory and maritime zones \"in a manner befitting a responsible and law abiding member of the international community.\"\n\n\"We have submitted our assertions to rigorous legal scrutiny by the world's leading jurists. So the lines that we draw on our waters are not derived from just our imagination, but from international law.\"\n\nHe pointed to not only UNCLOS, but the 2016 ruling, saying that it affirms what belongs to the Philippines by legal right.\n\nMarcos said that he would not allow the waters of the West Philippine Sea -- the official designation by the Philippines to the parts of the South China Sea in the country's exclusive economic zone -- to be detached from its maritime domain.\n\n\"As president, I have sworn this solemn commitment from the very first day that I took office, I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Marcos said the Philippines is still committed to addressing and managing difficult issues through dialogue and diplomacy.\n\n\"We cannot afford any other future for the South China Sea other than the one envisioned by ASEAN, a sea of peace, stability, and prosperity,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that the South China Sea was the passageway for half the world's trade, and called the peace and stability of the region a \"world issue,\" pointing out that \"it is quite easy to see that it is in fact the entire world that have become stakeholders in the peace and stability of our region.\"\n\nMarcos was of the view that security and stability concerns all countries, and highlighted that \"interests and responsibilities of all states and the community of nations must always be acknowledged.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Marcos Jr condemned illegal and aggressive actions in the South China Sea, warning these activities undermine regional peace and sovereignty. Speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, he called for responsible management of US-China rivalry to ensure stability. Marcos highlighted recent tense encounters and declared such acts close to war.\n\nPhilippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea, a disputed ocean territory that China has been flooding with coastguard ships in recent months.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the Shangri-La Dialogue defence summit in Singapore, Marcos said that the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries had a vision for \"peace, stability, and prosperity\" in the South China Sea, but that this was being undermined by other actors, without naming China. \"Unfortunately, this vision remains for now a distant reality. Illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\" Marcos said.\n\nEncounters between the Philippines and China in Asia's most contested waters have grown more tense and frequent during the past year as Beijing presses its claims to shoals in waters that Manila says are well within its exclusive economic zone. China's coast guard has stepped up so-called \"grey-zone\" activities such as use of water cannons, collisions and ramming tactics to try to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions. It has also deployed fishing boats that the Philippines and its allies consider militia.\n\nAfter his speech, Marcos called security in the South China Sea, through which a huge volume of trade passes, a global issue. Later, a reporter asked Marcos whether China would be crossing a \"red line\" if one of its coast guard ships killed a Filipino with water cannons. \"If a Filipino citizen was killed by a wilful act, that is very close to what we define as an act of war,\" Marcos replied. \"We would have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly.\"\n\nThe Philippines, a sprawling archipelago with strong historical ties to the United States and close geographical proximity to China, is at the centre of an intensifying power struggle between Washington and Beijing. Earlier on Friday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China's defence minister, Dong Jun, met in Singapore on the sidelines of Asia's premier defence summit.\n\nDuring the meeting with Dong, Austin underscored the importance of freedom of navigation under international law, especially in the South China Sea, according to a Pentagon statement released after the meeting. Dong responded by telling Austin that the United States was stoking tensions through its military presence in the region, his spokesperson told reporters.\n\nMarcos said tensions between the United States and China were destabilising for Southeast Asia, calling on Washington and Beijing to work harder to resolve disputes. \"Their rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. Their contest is exacerbating flashpoints\n\nand has created new security dilemmas,\" Marcos said. \"The continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage their rivalry in a responsible manner,\" he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Beijing claims the ban promotes sustainable fishing and conserves marine ecology in the waterway.\n\nCommodore Ray Vincent Trinidad, a Philippine Navy spokesman, said on Tuesday that the force had deployed additional vessels to protect Filipino fishermen.\n\n\"The Philippine Navy does not recognize this provocative statement nor will we be deterred in performing our mandate of securing the welfare of Filipinos wherever he or she is - on land or on sea,\" said Trinidad, spokesman for the West Philippine Sea, referring to China's fishing moratorium.\n\n\"Overall, patrols have been increased in the entire [West Philippine Sea].\"\n\nManila calls areas in the South China Sea that are within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) the West Philippine Sea.\n\nChina's fishing moratorium this year, which began on May 1 and is scheduled to last until Sept. 16, will take place as a new China Coast Guard order is scheduled to go into force June 15.\n\nThe Chinese coast guard had on May 15 issued an order authorizing its personnel to detain foreign boats and nationals suspected of trespassing into Beijing-claimed waters in the South China Sea for up to 30 days - and as many as 60, in some cases. Manila has called this order \"illegal,\" warning against repercussions if it is implemented.\n\nMeanwhile, Filipino fishermen said they would continue to fish in the waters that Manila claims despite threats of arrest by Chinese authorities.\n\n\"We will not follow this baseless ban by China in our waters,\" Joey Marabe, provincial coordinator of the Filipino fishermen's group Pamalakaya in Zambales, told BenarNews on Tuesday.\n\nHe called the ban an \"unacceptable insult,\" alleging that China had been known for destructive fishing practices.\n\nMarabe said the ban would directly affect the livelihood of Filipino fishermen and vowed they would ignore it.\n\n\"No foreigner has the right to stop us from fishing in our own territory,\" he said.\n\nChina in 2012 seized the Scarborough Shoal, a traditional fishing ground in another part of Manila's EEZ, after a two-month standoff with the Philippine Navy.\n\nManila subsequently took China to an international arbitral court, and in 2016 won a landmark ruling in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which threw out China's expansive claims in the South China Sea.\n\nBeijing, however, has ignored the ruling and refuses to leave Scarborough Shoal, which Manila calls Bajo de Masinloc. Recently, the China Coast Guard shadowed a Filipino civilian mission to Scarborough, though there was no major incident.\n\n'Constructive multilateralism'\n\nOn Monday, Manila filed its 25th diplomatic protest against China this year, and the 158th since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was elected in 2022.\n\nThe \"unilateral imposition of the fishing moratorium raises tensions in the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea,\" Manila's Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement after summoning the Chinese envoy.\n\n\"Through a diplomatic note, the Philippines protested the ban insofar as it includes the [Philippines'] maritime zones over which the Philippines has sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe statement added that the ban had undermined an understanding between Marcos and Chinese leader Xi Jinping that both countries would \"manage differences through diplomacy and dialogue,\" and reduce tensions at sea.\n\nChina's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a BenarNews request for comment.\n\nManila's protest came days before Marcos is expected to discuss the South China Sea dispute in his keynote speech at an international security forum in Singapore.\n\nTop political and security leaders from dozens of countries are most likely to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue this weekend. The annual inter-governmental security forum is organized by the Singaporean think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\n\"I think it is extremely timely that I attend [the Shangri-La Dialogue] and put forward and articulate the Philippines' perspectives and outlook on defense and diplomacy while we continue to highlight the Philippines' commitment to a rules-based international order and constructive multilateralism amidst the current geopolitical challenges that we face in our region,\" Marcos said on Tuesday, before he departed for a state visit to Brunei en route to Singapore.\n\nBenarNews is an RFA-affiliated online news organization.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's never a choice. Both countries are important.\"\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, is a key focus of Washington's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region as it seeks to counter China's growing military might and influence.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the United States in the event of any conflict.\n\nThe Philippines expanded a 2014 agreement last year to give the US military access to another four of its bases, taking the total to nine, including two in the far north of the country less than 450 kilometres (280 miles) from Taiwan.\n\nThe Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement allows US troops to rotate through and store defence equipment and supplies.\n\nThe United States' growing presence in the region and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea have infuriated China's leaders in Beijing.\n\nChina has accused the United States of using the Philippines as a \"pawn to stir up trouble in the South China Sea\".\n\nManila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes, but tensions have worsened under Marcos.\n\nIn an effort to win international backing for its stance, Manila has published images of incidents involving Chinese and Philippine vessels and invited local and foreign media on its patrol boats.\n\nChina Coast Guard vessels have used water cannon against Philippine boats multiple times in the contested waters, where there have also been collisions that injured several Filipino troops.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,\" Marcos said Friday.\n\n\"I do not intend to yield,\" he said. \"Filipinos do not yield\".\n\nBeijing defends its actions as \"legitimate\" and \"necessary law enforcement measures\" in response to Philippine vessels that it says have illegally entered its territorial waters.\n\n\"China has never used its size to bully smaller countries, nor would it ever do so, but China has always been principled, and has bottom lines,\" He Lei, a Chinese general and former vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences, told reporters after Marcos's speech.\n\n\"It will never allow certain countries to act outrageously.\"\n\nChina claims almost the entire waterway, brushing off rival claims from other countries, including the Philippines, and ignoring an international ruling that its claims have no legal basis.\n\nTo assert its stance, Beijing deploys coast guard and other boats to patrol the waters and has turned several reefs into artificial islands that it has militarised.\n\nMany of the confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have happened near Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands.\n\nThe reef, where a handful of Filipino troops are garrisoned on a grounded navy vessel, is about 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan, and more than 1,000 kilometres from China's nearest major landmass, Hainan island.", "source": {"uri":

Marcos. It was yet another flex of diplomacy, history, and personal ties that converged with Marcos Jr. as the country's foreign policy architect.\n\nTalk of geopolitics was also backed up by the signing of an agreement on \"Maritime Cooperation.\"\n\nWhile a copy of the document has not been made public, Marcos himself described it as a \"diplomatic agreement between Brunei and the Philippines as to the resolution of conflicts and a... bilateral mechanism for us to have that line of communication so that there is very little room for misunderstanding or a mistake or the kinds of things that can cause problems between countries.\"\n\nThe signing of an agreement with Brunei comes just four months after Manila, during Marcos' state visit to Vietnam, signed an agreement on incident prevention and management in the South China Sea with Hanoi.\n\nThat means that in the first half of 2024 alone, the Philippines has managed to forge two maritime agreements, both on preventing and managing maritime conflict, with Southeast Asian neighbors who happen to be co-claimants of features in the South China Sea.\n\nIt's a move Marcos had announced before.\n\nDuring a November 2023 visit to Hawaii, Marcos said Manila would make the effort to reach out to other claimant states as talks between China and ASEAN for a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea continue without an end in sight.\n\n\"We have taken the initiative to approach those other countries around ASEAN with whom we have existing territorial conflicts, Vietnam being one of them, Malaysia being another, and to make our own code of conduct. Hopefully this will grow further and extend to other ASEAN countries,\" he said during an event at the Daniel Inouye Center.\n\nBy \"code of conduct,\" Marcos meant bilateral agreements with Southeast Asian neighbors.\n\n\"Brunei is a claimant state in the South China Sea dispute. Regardless of its silence, coordination with the country is crucial if Manila seeks to illustrate its intentions of socializing its position with its immediate neighbors in Southeast Asia,\" explained Don McLain Gill, a geopolitical analyst who teaches at the Department of International Studies of the De La Salle University in Manila.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, and Malaysia claim different parts of the South China Sea, which China, meanwhile, claims in almost its entirety. Taiwan also claims most of the South China Sea, although unlike Beijing, Taipei has not resorted to aggressive actions in making its claims.\n\n\"Socializing\" the Philippines' position, explained Gill, means \"[deepening] communication and diplomatic engagements\" with fellow claimant Brunei \"to allow it to become more familiar with Manila's position.\"\n\n\"A security [Memorandum of Understanding] is an important prerequisite for deeper talks on security issues. So it is a helpful stepping stone,\" he added.\n\nUnlike most Southeast Asian claimants in the South China Sea, Manila has been especially loud and assertive in defending both its sovereign rights and sovereignty claims.\n\nMarcos' rhetoric has been clear: that the Philippines, under his watch, would not give up \"a single square inch of our territory.\"\n\nThe policy at sea is clearer than even the waters of the West Philippine Sea: the Philippines, with its limited maritime and naval resources, is to keep constant watch over these waters.\n\nIn spite of China's aggressive actions - \"dangerous maneuvers,\" blocking, and the use of water cannons against Philippine government vessels - the Philippines has remained seemingly unfazed.\n\n\"We seek no conflict with any nation, more so nations that purport and claim to be our friends but we will not be cowed into silence, submission, or subservience. Filipinos do not yield,\" said Marcos in March 2024, after China blasted its strong water cannons during a Philippine mission to Ayungin (Second Thomas) Shoal.\n\nBeijing's response has been to accuse the Philippines of instigating these encounters, as well as reneging on supposed deals. That, or pinning the blame for Manila's new-found vigor in defending its sovereign rights on supposed American influence.\n\nOf the deals China has claimed, only one seems to be acknowledged, at least in part, by both sides - a \"gentleman's agreement\" to keep the \"status quo\" in the South China Sea forged under former president Rodrigo Duterte.\n\nBut that deal was informal and temporary. It also meant that the Philippines would not make the most of its hard-fought win in the 2016 Arbitral Ruling, which deemed China's sweeping South China Sea claim, among other things, invalid.\n\nThe 2016 Arbitral Ruling has been front and center of the Marcos administration's policy in the South China Sea.\n\nMost prominent in the Marcos administration's West Philippine Sea approach is its \"transparency initiative,\" or its effort to publicize - through official government releases and independent reports from journalists - China's actions in the disputed waters.\n\nCountries like the US, Japan, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and members of the European Union, among others, are almost always quick to react and side with the Philippines whenever China uses aggressive actions - short of an armed attack - in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nForeign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo earlier told Rappler that the initiative has made \"the rest of the world aware of the situation in the West Philippine Sea.\"\n\n\"This may not have been possible to that extent without this kind of transparency because they've been barely aware of this. I think they see the logic and consistency of our position and they see that our position is consistent with international law,\" Manalo told Rappler in late April 2024 in an interview on the World View with Marites Vitug.\n\nMore countries have joined - in varying degrees - the list of those who believe in \"rules-based order\" and who have also publicly affirmed their support of the 2016 Arbitral Ruling. Rising Asian powerhouse India and nearby South Korea are among the latest to begin expressing support for the Philippines under the Marcos administration.\n\nWhat's missing in the list? Southeast Asian countries - a fact that Beijing likes pointing out.\n\nSue Thompson, an associate professor at the Australian National University whose research has focused on Southeast Asia, told Rappler that the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN)'s seeming inability to make a unified stand on the South China Sea, for or against China, shouldn't be surprising.\n\nIt's not what it was made to do, after all.\n\n\"ASEAN is there to provide peace and stability in the region, but it was never meant to be a security alliance,\" said Thompson in an interview in March 2024.\n\nThat's not to say that ASEAN has remained totally silent as tensions in the South China Sea rise. Foreign ministers, in December 2023, issued a statement expressing concern over these rising tensions.\n\nIndonesia, where the ASEAN headquarters is located, cited the 2016 Arbitral Ruling in a diplomatic note to the United Nations in May 2020.\n\nASEAN bloc members have taken notice of the Philippines' novel initiative, with a few asking Manila's embassies for briefings on the situation in the West Philippine Sea.\n\nBut there are some who've felt uneasy over how loud and public Manila has been in exposing China's aggressive actions, based on conversations Rappler has had with diplomats.\n\nIt's not that they would find it hard to believe. Other claimant countries, after all, have also been subjected to China's incursions. But many of them have chosen to keep it on the down low, much like Manila under former president Duterte.\n\nAnd while many of the claimants in the South China Sea belong to ASEAN, a bigger part of the bloc has no direct stake in the dispute. \"Each individual nation-state within ASEAN will have their own relationship with China. And a lot of those relationships are based on economic ties,\" Thompson said.\n\nASEAN is China's largest trading partner. China is also the top trading partner of several ASEAN members, including South China Sea claimants - the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia.\n\nIt's to Beijing's advantage when incursions and confrontations are toned down. It's why China has always preferred bilateral discussions of disputes over multilateral methods. It's also why Beijing seethed when Manila took the issue to court in 2013, which led to the 2016 Arbitral Award.\n\nAfter six years of things playing out as it wanted under Duterte, Beijing is barely coming to terms with the Marcos administration's loud and bold strategy - to shine the spotlight on incidents China wants kept in the shadows.\n\nThe Philippines and Vietnam, in the agreement from January 2024, promised to build on existing bilateral trust, confidence, and understanding through, among other things:\n\nIn a press release, the Philippines' Presidential Communications Office said Manila and Brunei's Maritime Cooperation deal covers \"pollution, skills training, research and information sharing.\" Neither country offered details on what \"skills training\" and \"information sharing\" would cover, with the Philippines noting that the understanding is \"crucial for maritime nations\" like Brunei and the Philippines.\n\nGill said the agreement helps in bringing the focus back to Manila's efforts to bring ASEAN to the forefront of its efforts in the West Philippine Sea.\n\n\"The MoU will also illustrate that contrary to the region's misperception, that the Philippines only wants to bring in external military powers into the region, Manila wants to deepen intra-regional maritime security cooperation with its neighbors to spearhead home grown solutions,\" he said.\n\nIt's an important move when, according to research by the UK-based International Institute of Strategic Studies, the US and China are what drive the \"significant increase\" of military drills in Asia from 2023 and 2022.\n\nMarcos is set to keynote the IISS' Shangrila Dialogues, the region's premiere defense summit, on May 31. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com",

It's never a choice. Both countries are important.\"\n\nThe Philippines, a treaty ally of the United States, is a key focus of Washington's efforts to strengthen alliances and partnerships in the Asia-Pacific region as it seeks to counter China's growing military might and influence.\n\nGiven its position in the South China Sea and proximity to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, Philippine support would be crucial for the United States in the event of any conflict.\n\nThe Philippines expanded a 2014 agreement last year to give US military access to another four of its bases, taking the total to nine, including two in the far north of the country less than 450 kilometres (280 miles) from Taiwan.\n\nThe Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement allows US troops to rotate through and store defence equipment and supplies.\n\nThe United States' growing presence in the region and its regular deployment of warships and fighter jets in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea have infuriated China's leaders in Beijing.\n\nChina has accused the United States of using the Philippines as a \"pawn to stir up trouble in the South China Sea\".\n\nManila and Beijing have a long history of maritime territorial disputes, but tensions have worsened under Marcos.\n\nIn an effort to win international backing for its stance, Manila has published images of incidents involving Chinese and Philippine vessels, and invited local and foreign media on its patrol boats.\n\nChina Coast Guard vessels have used water cannon against Philippine boats multiple times in the contested waters, where there have also been collisions that injured several Filipino troops.\n\nBeijing defends its actions as \"legitimate\" and \"necessary law enforcement measures\" in response to Philippine vessels that it says have illegally entered its territorial waters.\n\nChina claims almost the entire waterway, brushing off rival claims from other countries, including the Philippines, and ignoring an international ruling that its claims have no legal basis.\n\nTo assert its stance, Beijing deploys coast guard and other boats to patrol the waters and has turned several reefs into artificial islands that it has militarised.\n\nMany of the confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels have happened near Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratly Islands.\n\nThe reef, where a handful of Filipino troops are garrisoned on a grounded navy vessel, is about 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan, and more than 1,000 kilometres from China's nearest major landmass, Hainan island.\n\n\"Illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdictions,\" Marcos said Friday.\n\n\"I do not intend to yield,\" he said. \"Filipinos do not yield\".", "source": {"uri": "spacewar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SpaceWar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea",

Is that a red line? Almost certainly it's going to be a red line,\" he added, in response to a question from the floor after his keynote speech at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue held in Singapore.\n\nIn March, China's coast guard fired a water cannon on a Philippine vessel, which the Philippines said resulted in injuries and property damage.\n\nA member of the audience had asked Mr Marcos during the brief Q&A session after his address that if water cannons fired by Chinese coast guards killed a Filipino sailor, would that \"cross a red line\".\n\nIn the past year, Manila and Beijing have been embroiled in heated stand-offs over their longstanding competing claims in the South China Sea.\n\nEarlier in May, the Philippines accused China of building \"an artificial island\" in a disputed area and deployed a ship \"to monitor the supposed illegal activities\", with two other vessels in rotational deployment in the area.\n\nBeijing claims jurisdiction over most of the South China Sea, where more than US$3 trillion (S$5 trillion) of global trade passes annually, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nSince assuming office in 2022, Mr Marcos has taken a tougher line than his predecessor towards China's actions, while backed by defence allies the United States, as well as Japan and Australia.\n\nIt was the first time a Philippine head of state delivered the keynote speech at the annual defence summit, and comes as Singapore and the Philippines mark 55 years of diplomatic ties.\n\nMr Marcos' speech marks the opening of the three-day regional security forum, organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, held from May 31 to June 2 at the Shangri-La Hotel, attended by defence ministers from around the world, including the US and China.\n\nEarlier in the day, US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun - newly appointed just five months ago, who was sitting in the audience when Mr Marcos gave his keynote address - met on the sidelines of the summit in a 75-minute meeting that ran longer than scheduled.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits

Is that a red line? Almost certainly.\"\n\nMarcos said at an international defence forum in Singapore that the US, which has a mutual defence treaty with the Philippines, held \"to the same standards\". The president's comments marked the first time he has suggested scenarios that could trigger a request for help under the 1951 treaty.\n\nSince August last year, Chinese coast guard ships have repeatedly used water cannon against Philippine ships resupplying a military outpost in disputed waters of the South China Sea, damaging vessels and injuring Filipino sailors.\n\n\"We already have suffered injury, but thank God we have not yet gotten to the point [of a death]. But once we get to that point, we would have crossed the Rubicon,\" Marcos said.\n\nManila's determined pushback against the actions of the Chinese coast guard have raised concerns the long-running territorial dispute in the strategic South China Sea could trigger armed conflict.\n\nThe Philippines regularly sends resupply ships to the Sierra Madre, a rusting former US military vessel it ran aground on purpose in 1999 on Second Thomas Shoal, a sandbank in the South China Sea also claimed by China, and where it has stationed a handful of soldiers.\n\nSince early last year, China has stepped up efforts to disrupt those resupply missions with coast guard and maritime militia ships.\n\nIn 2023, Manila said a Chinese ship targeted its vessel with a laser, and last year several ships collided as a result of what the Philippines described as Chinese blocking manoeuvres.\n\nMarcos remarks came after a speech to defence ministers, military chiefs, diplomats and analysts at the Shangri-La Dialogue forum in which he described his own country as a protector of a regional security order based on international law and treaties.\n\n\"Our efforts stand in stark contrast to a certain actor,\" he said, adding that in the South China Sea, the Philippines was \"on the front lines\" of efforts to preserve the integrity of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which governs the rights of coastal states.\n\nChina's claim over the South China Sea almost in its entirety clashes with the economic rights and in some cases sovereignty of several coastal states under Unclos, but Marcos has made his country China's most vocal challenger on the issue since taking office in mid-2022.\n\nHe has also reinvigorated Manila's alliance with the US, overseeing the largest bilateral military exercises in three decades and allowing US forces increased access to his country's bases. \"I do not intend to yield. Filipinos do not yield,\" Marcos said.\n\nMarcos asserted the right of the region's countries to determine their own future rather than being treated as a \"theatre\" for great power competition. Strategic competition between the US and China was constraining regional nations' choices and exacerbating flashpoints, he said.\n\n\"China's determining influence [in the region] is a permanent

And therefore, the peace and stability of the South China Sea and the freedom of navigation of the South China Sea is a world issue,\" said Marcos, the first Philippine President to deliver the keynote address at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)'s Shangri-la Dialogue.\n\nAfter a speech that focused on the importance of upholding international law, of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Centrality, and of middle powers' role in regional stability, a member of the audience stood up to ask if the Philippines was \"[risking]\" regional peace by \"[considering] other parties' comfort level\" in its actions at sea.\n\nChinese Major General Xu Hui, Commandant of the Chinese military's International College of Defense Studies, went on a long preamble about ASEAN centrality before being prompted by IISS executive chairman Sir John Chipman to ask his question.\n\nThe one-star general, who did not introduce himself on the microphone, asked: \"In the eyes of the international community, some of [the] Philippines' behavior in recent days, recent times, it now sounds like you really consider other parties' comfort level. And there is a risk of ruining the regional long-term, long-lasting peace since the end of the... colonized history. What's your comment on that? Thank you very much.\"\n\nMarcos said the Philippines \"still remains true to the principles\" of the ASEAN bloc.\n\n\"If you examine more closely the remarks that I just made, we precisely focus on ASEAN centrality... so the Philippines still remains true to the principles that were established and upon which ASEAN was born. And I think, as I said, that many of these things, we no longer speak of today, but we must,\" said Marcos.\n\n\"I would even go far as to say there is no such thing as a regional issue any longer.... We must include all parties in the discussion because now it is not just ASEAN member states who are stakeholders. And it is quite easy to see that it is, in fact, the entire world that have become stakeholders in the peace and stability of our region,\" he added.\n\nXu's question falls right in line with how Beijing has framed tensions in the South China Sea - that it's the Philippines who is causing trouble in those waters. China has also accused the Philippines of allowing itself to be dictated to by its treaty-ally, the United States.\n\nIn previous engagements and fora, Marcos has insisted that tensions in the region should not be seen through the lens of superpower competition alone.\n\nThe Shangri-la Dialogue is considered the region's premiere defense summit because of its format - in allowing delegates to interact more directly and intimately with each other. It's been the setting for frank, sometimes spirited exchanges between top defense and security officials in the region.\n\nIn his speech, Marcos said, \"lines that [the Philippines] draw in our waters are not derived from just our imagination, but from international law,\" a barely-veiled reference to China's argument for claiming a huge part of the South China Sea. The Philippines' sovereign rights in the South China Sea are based on UNCLOS or the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as well as the 2016 Arbitral Ruling that deemed China's sweeping claim illegal.\n\nTensions between Beijing and Manila have risen in the past year or so, with the Philippines' new-found vigor in defending its rights and claims in the West Philippine Sea, or part of the South China Sea that includes the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.\n\nConfrontations between the two countries out at sea are tense and precarious, with China wielding its coast guard's water cannons in attempts to stop Philippine missions both to Ayungin and Panatag Shoals. The Philippines' foreign affairs secretary has described the relationship as \"choppy,\" while his Chinese counterpart has described it as \"at a crossroads.\"\n\nRelations turned even tenser after it was revealed - initially through the Chinese embassy in Manila, no less - that Chinese diplomats assigned to the Philippines had illegally recorded a phone call with a Philippine military general. The Chinese embassy claimed this was proof that Manila made, then turned its back on supposed agreements concerning Ayungin Shoal in the West Philippine Sea. The Philippines has denied China's agreement claims.\n\nASEAN is a regional bloc that counts the Philippines as its founding member. Several claimant states to areas and features in the South China Sea - the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia - are also members of ASEAN. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com",

Biden called from Air Force One two days after the election, holding a friendly ten-minute exchange with Marcos that \"really set the tone for our relationship with the United States,\" Romualdez said.\n\nThe tone, from the US perspective, desperately needed changing. Rodrigo Duterte, who preceded Marcos had tilted away from Washington and repeatedly questioned the Southeast Asian nation's decades-old alliance with the US.\n\nYet even American officials have been surprised by just how much Marcos has shifted the Philippines back toward the US since he took office roughly two years ago. While Marcos in no way wants to be seen as a US pawn, one official said, he was disillusioned by China's actions in the South China Sea and is fully on board with strengthening ties with Washington.\n\nMarcos' outspoken pushback on China, highlighted by his efforts to publicize confrontations between the two countries in the South China Sea, has turned him into somewhat of a star among the US and its allies. He had the rare honor of addressing the Australian parliament, and on Friday, he'll deliver the keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security conference in Singapore that brings together defense chiefs from the US, China and other nations.\n\n\"I can feel it in DC, you know,\" Romualdez said, where he's based. \"He's really the most sought after leader now, worldwide and in the United States,\" the envoy said.\n\nThe West's embrace of Marcos is a remarkable shift from his family's pariah status after his father was ousted from power almost four decades ago. Some observers initially thought he would hold a grudge against the Americans for prompting his family's exile to Hawaii after the 1986 revolt that ended his father's dictatorship.\n\nBiden's phone call to Marcos in May 2022 was soon followed by high-profile visits from the US secretaries of state and defense, as his administration made it a priority to revive longstanding alliances in a bid to compete with China. Biden met Marcos on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September of that year, and two months later his vice president was in Manila.\n\nWithin six months of his inauguration, Marcos had completed an almost total overhaul of Manila's policy towards the US -- and by extension, China. Shortly afterward, he handed Washington's military planners something they greatly coveted: access to four additional bases in the Philippines, three close to Taiwan.\n\nU-Turn\n\nDuterte had largely ignored a 2016 ruling by a UN-backed tribunal that had declared China's expansive claims illegal, aiming instead for better relations with Beijing -- a position Marcos appeared to back on the campaign trail.\n\nBut Marcos shifted course once in office, repeatedly citing the 2016 ruling and putting the blame on Beijing for boosting tensions. China claims much of the South China Sea for itself, has built military facilities over reclaimed disputed areas and has conducted large military exercises near Taiwan.\n\n\"We have not instigated any kind of conflict. We have not instigated any kind of confrontation,\" Marcos told Bloomberg in a March interview. Since the threat from China has grown, he said, \"we must do more to defend our territory.\"\n\nEarly into his term, Marcos appeared to want to balance ties as much as possible. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in January 2023 on a state visit to Beijing, where the two leaders amicably discussed maritime differences and restarted talks on oil and gas exploration.\n\nRead: Xi's Fleet Is Winning the South China Sea Energy Fight\n\nBut everything changed a few weeks later. During a visit by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Pentagon announced it had secured access to four additional bases in the Philippines, reinvigorating their decades-old military ties.\n\n\"It was seen by Beijing as positioning the US to interfere in the Taiwan contingency because of the location,\" said Ngeow Chow Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya. \"It was very hard for Beijing to feel that the Marcos government had any good intention.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expanded military deal was announced, the gloves came off. On Feb. 14, 2023, the Philippines protested China's flaring of a military-grade laser on a Coast Guard vessel, temporarily blinding the crew and forcing it to retreat.\n\nThe 'Squad'\n\nSince then, dangerous encounters in the South China Sea have become increasingly routine. Beijing's armada of fishing boats and Coast Guard vessels have often blocked Philippine ships and even collided with them, raising the risk of a conflict with China that could potentially draw in the US.\n\nChina has repeatedly warned the Philippines about involving \"external forces\" into their dispute, while maintaining that its maritime actions are reasonable and professional.\n\nThe US and its allies have given the Philippines steadfast diplomatic support, while providing it with real-time intelligence. US planes routinely circle overhead on Philippine resupply missions to a dilapidated World War II-era ship that serves as a military outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe US recently assembled a grouping privately called the \"Squad\" with the Philippines, Australia and Japan to conduct maritime drills and provide greater security assistance to Manila. The Philippines is also working on troop visits with France, in addition to deals with Japan and Australia. In recent weeks, it conducted one of the largest joint exercises ever with the US.\n\nManila is hoping to leverage the enhanced military relationship to win more US investment and diversify from China, its top trading partner.\n\nThe US recently promised $1 billion in tech and energy investments, and a deal to boost the Philippines' role in the nickel supply chain to cut China's dominance is also under discussion. The US and Japan have also committed to build rails, ports and factors in a so-called \"economic corridor\" on the Philippines' main island.\n\n\"Our alliance with the United States has become stronger, bolstered by our economic engagements,\" Marcos said last month during his fourth trip to the US in two years.\n\nMarcos has sought to use the clashes in the South China Sea to his advantage, inviting media from across the world to view China's actions. And that strategy is showing some signs of paying off, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\"Some of the PRC's behavior at sea may have become more careful and restrained as a result of the Philippines' efforts,\" he said, using an acronym for China. \"This suggests that amid the friction and intensifying differences, even Beijing wishes to be able to manage escalation and is acting more carefully than it otherwise could.\"\n\nWith assistance from Rebecca Choong Wilkins, Cliff Venzon and Colum Murphy.\n\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.\n\nMilestone Alert!

You don\u2019t know what effort is going to be successful,\u201d he said on Wednesday in Brunei, en route to Singapore where he is expected to speak at the Shangri-La Dialogue about the Philippines\u2019 efforts to resolve the maritime gridlock with China.\n\nIn Singapore, Marcos Jnr and Philippine defence officials will be in close physical proximity to Chinese military officials, who ordered blockades and the use of water cannons against Philippine vessels in a months-long row in the contested waterway.\n\n\u201cAny point of contact that I can establish, I will use it, and at every level, as long as it brings us progress in terms of resolving these [issues],\u201d Marcos Jnr said.\n\nThe Philippines and China have been engaged in a war of words in recent weeks, with Beijing accusing Manila of reneging on a \u201cnew model\u201d for handling resupply missions to the now-infamous Philippine naval vessel BRP Sierra Madre that was intentionally run aground at Second Thomas Shoal in the disputed South China Sea.\n\nUnder the supposed model, Manila would only deploy one coastguard vessel and a resupply boat to the shoal, while China would only launch one coastguard ship and a fishing boat.\n\nMarcos Jnr and Philippine defence and military officials have denied agreeing to such an arrangement.\n\nMarcos said in Brunei that he was open to negotiating with China on putting an end to \u201caggressive actions\u201d such as water cannons and lasers and allowing Filipino fishermen to fish safely again.\n\nChina\u2019s recent imposition of a four-month unilateral fishing ban in the South China Sea, which encroached on the Philippines\u2019 maritime territory, was \u201cvery worrisome\u201d and an \u201cescalation of the situation\u201d, Marcos Jnr said.\n\nHe also noted the summit\u2019s focus on the West Philippine Sea and its importance to global trade, saying his invitation to give the keynote speech was a \u201crecognition of challenges facing the Philippines\u201d.\n\nSee Seng Tan, a research adviser at Singapore\u2019s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the summit is likely to address global security issues such the Israel-Gaza war, the Ukraine war and South China Sea issues.\n\n\u201cAny reference on the part of Marcos Jnr [about] \u2026 the simmering tensions over the Second Thomas Shoal, and his rejection of Beijing\u2019s claim about a 2016 agreement allegedly struck with Manila over access to the South China Sea islands, is likely to invite pushback from the Chinese, who have accused Manila and Washington of joining forces against Beijing.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that China\u2019s new defence minister Dong Jun, a former navy chief with leadership experience in the Southern Theatre Command that oversees the South China Sea, will make his debut with an international audience during

Filipinos do not yield.\"\n\nChina has rejected the Philippines claims and the tribunal's ruling.\n\nAs Marcos spoke, it wasn't immediately clear if China's Defense Minister Dong Jun had taken his seat at a head table in the audience. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was present, scheduled to take a seat between Marcos and Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto.\n\nWhile Marcos didn't directly name check China in his address, there is little doubt his focus was on Beijing. Since taking office two years ago, Marcos has adopted a more assertive approach toward defending its claims, prompting clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels at places like Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nIn a move that took some allies by surprise, Marcos has also tightly embraced his nation's decades-old military partnership with the US, opening up new military facilities to American personnel, expanding joint military exercises and improving ties with US allies like Japan and Australia.\n\nAfter years in which Marcos's predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, distanced the Philippines from the US in a bid to win more support from China, the shift has been welcomed by the Biden administration. The Philippines is in a strategic spot as it is near two potential flash points: Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nThe Philippines under Marcos has also publicized and protested increasingly frequent clashes with China in the resource-rich sea. Beijing has maintained that its actions, including the use of water cannons, are reasonable and professional.\n\n--With assistance from Clarissa Batino and Peter Martin.", "source": {"uri":

Biden called from Air Force One two days after the election, holding a friendly 10-minute exchange with Marcos that \u201creally set the tone for our relationship with the United States,\u201d Romualdez said.\n\nThe tone, from the US perspective, desperately needed changing. Rodrigo Duterte, who preceded Marcos had tilted away from Washington and repeatedly questioned the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s decades-old alliance with the US.\n\nYet even American officials have been surprised by just how much Marcos has shifted the Philippines back towards the US since he took office roughly two years ago. While Marcos in no way wants to be seen as a US pawn, one official said, he was disillusioned by China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea and is fully on board with strengthening ties with Washington.\n\n\u201cMany expected Marcos to shift back towards the Philippines\u2019 traditional close ties with the US,\u201d said Gregory Poling, director of the Southeast Asia Programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC think tank. \u201cBut he has gone much farther, undertaking a generational modernisation of the alliance to defend against Chinese aggression.\u201d\n\nMarcos\u2019 outspoken pushback on China, highlighted by his efforts to publicise confrontations between the two countries in the South China Sea, has turned him into somewhat of a star among the US and its allies.\n\nHe had the rare honour of addressing the Australian parliament, and on Friday, he\u2019ll deliver the keynote speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security conference in Singapore that brings together defence chiefs from the US, China and other nations.\n\n\u201cI can feel it in DC, you know,\u201d Romualdez said, where he is based. \u201cHe\u2019s really the most sought after leader now, worldwide and in the United States,\u201d the envoy said.\n\nThe West\u2019s embrace of Marcos is a remarkable shift from his family\u2019s pariah status after his father was ousted from power almost four decades ago. Some observers initially thought he would hold a grudge against the Americans for prompting his family\u2019s exile to Hawaii after the 1986 revolt that ended his father\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nBiden\u2019s phone call to Marcos in May 2022 was soon followed by high-profile visits from the US secretaries of state and defence, as his administration made it a priority to revive long-standing alliances in a bid to compete with China. Biden met Marcos on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September of that year, and two months later his vice-president was in Manila.\n\nWithin six months of his inauguration, Marcos had completed an almost total overhaul of Manila\u2019s policy towards the US \u2013 and by extension, China. Shortly afterwards, he handed Washington\u2019s military planners something they greatly coveted: access to four additional bases in the Philippines, three close to Taiwan.\n\nDuterte had largely ignored a 2016 ruling by a UN-backed tribunal that had declared China\u2019s expansive claims illegal, aiming instead for better relations with Beijing \u2013 a position Marcos appeared to back on the campaign trail.\n\nBut Marcos shifted course once in office, repeatedly citing the 2016 ruling and putting the blame on Beijing for boosting tensions. China claims much of the South China Sea for itself, has built military facilities over reclaimed disputed areas and has conducted large military exercises near Taiwan.\n\n\u201cWe have not instigated any kind of conflict. We have not instigated any kind of confrontation,\u201d Marcos said in March. Since the threat from China has grown, he said, \u201cwe must do more to defend our territory.\u201d\n\nEarly into his term, Marcos appeared to want to balance ties as much as possible. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping in January 2023 on a state visit to Beijing, where the two leaders amicably discussed maritime differences and restarted talks on oil and gas exploration.\n\nBut everything changed a few weeks later. During a visit by Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Pentagon announced it had secured access to four additional bases in the Philippines, reinvigorating their decades-old military ties.\n\n\u201cIt was seen by Beijing as positioning the US to interfere in the Taiwan contingency because of the location,\u201d said Ngeow Chow Bing, director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya. \u201cIt was very hard for Beijing to feel that the Marcos government had any good intention.\u201d\n\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. While many nations, including the US, do not officially acknowledge Taiwan as an independent state, they oppose any use of force to alter the existing status quo.\n\nTwo weeks after the expanded military deal was announced, the gloves came off. On February 14, 2023, the Philippines protested China\u2019s flaring of a military-grade laser on a coastguard vessel, temporarily blinding the crew and forcing it to retreat.\n\nSince then, dangerous encounters in the South China Sea have become increasingly routine. Beijing\u2019s armada of fishing boats and coastguard vessels have often blocked Philippine ships and even collided with them, raising the risk of a conflict with China that could potentially draw in the US.\n\nChina has repeatedly warned the Philippines about involving \u201cexternal forces\u201d into their dispute, while maintaining that its maritime actions are reasonable and professional.\n\nThe US and its allies have given the Philippines steadfast diplomatic support, while providing it with real-time intelligence. US planes routinely circle overhead on Philippine resupply missions to a dilapidated World War II-era ship that serves as a military outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal.\n\nThe US recently assembled a grouping privately called the \u201cSquad\u201d with the Philippines, Australia and Japan to conduct maritime drills and provide greater security assistance to Manila. The Philippines is also working on troop visits with France, in addition to deals with Japan and Australia. In recent weeks, it conducted one of the largest joint exercises ever with the US.\n\nManila is hoping to leverage the enhanced military relationship to win more US investment and diversify from China, its top trading partner.\n\nThe US recently promised US$1 billion in tech and energy investments, and a deal to boost the Philippines\u2019 role in the nickel supply chain to cut China\u2019s dominance is also under discussion. The US and Japan have also committed to build rails, ports and factors in a so-called \u201ceconomic corridor\u201d on the Philippines\u2019 main island.\n\n\u201cOur alliance with the United States has become stronger, bolstered by our economic engagements,\u201d Marcos said last month during his fourth trip to the US in two years.\n\nMarcos has sought to use the clashes in the South China Sea to his advantage, inviting media from across the world to view China\u2019s actions. And that strategy is showing some signs of paying off, according to Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\u201cSome of the PRC\u2019s behaviour at sea may have become more careful and restrained as a result of the Philippines\u2019 efforts,\u201d he said, using an acronym for China. \u201cThis suggests that amid the friction and intensifying differences, even Beijing wishes to be able to manage escalation and is acting more carefully than it otherwise could.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The US is bound by a treaty signed with the Philippines to come to the south-east Asian nation's defence, should it come under attack.\n\nThe US has previously said it will stand by its \"ironclad\" commitments to its allies in the region, and has sought to draw them closer including holding a summit with the Philippines and Japan last month.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Marcos had just finished delivering the opening address at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore when a delegate posed a hypothetical situation where Chinese water cannon killed a Filipino soldier. He was asked if he would consider that a red line, and if this would invoke the US-Philippines treaty.\n\n\"If by a wilful act a Filipino - not only serviceman, but even Filipino citizen - is killed... that is what I think very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly.

He said with the help of regional Pacific allies like the South Pacific Commission (now known as the Pacific Community) and Forum Fisheries Agency, as well as other countries -- the Cook Islands has created a mechanism where they work out and finalize maritime boundaries.\n\nMaisema said the tuna stocks in the region generate about $3.2 billion in annual earnings, so resolving disputes is important for every island state that shares in the fruits of the sea.\n\n\"We do have overlapping maritime boundaries and overlapping extended continental shelf claims\" but with the help of consortium partners supported by Australia and New Zealand and regional allies like SPC, these Pacific countries come together and meet face to face regularly to discuss and attempt to resolve differences, he said, adding that \"this is an ongoing effort.\"\n\n\"We are working together in the region, in the Pacific way to solve our boundary issue and we do it in the Pacific in the spirit of talanoa,\" he said. That means resolving disputes not only purely via diplomatic channels but also through social means such as sports events or cultural exchanges.\n\nIt will also benefit the Philippines if it does not face China alone but also build\n\nup its alliances and enlist the support of big countries like the United States, he said.\n\nDr. Carlyle A. Thayer, an emeritus professor at the Australian Defense Force Academy of the University of New South Wales, agreed with Maisema, saying it would greatly help the Philippines' cause to build alliances and mutual agreements with other countries so they could provide a unified front against China.\n\n\"The problem is, so far over the last couple of years, nothing has made China back off. Can we do this on our own? Probably not. So we must expand out,\" he said, such as building alliances with the United States and Japan.\n\nBut Thayer acknowledged that deterrence and diplomatic initiatives alone do not seem to work with China. The Philippines can bolster its efforts with mutual defense treaties that would aid the nation in case of an armed attack, and joint naval patrols in the region.\n\nThe Philippines will benefit from U.S. assistance in resupply runs to Philippine-held islands in the South China Sea, joint exercises and military visits from other countries, he added.\n\nAntonio T. Carpio, a retired justice of the Philippine Supreme Court, said losing the Philippines' EEZ to China's nine-dash-line claim over the West Philippine Sea will devastate the country's economy. China calls that nine-dash-line -- now 10-dash-line -- its international boundary. It encompasses the entire high seas of the South China Sea and vast areas of the exclusive economic zones of five coastal states: the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia.\n\nCarpio said if China succeeds in making the 10-dash-line its international boundary, the Philippines would lose 80 percent of its EEZ in the South China Sea and energy resources that would gravely impact the country's fuel supply (about 20 percent of the national energy requirement) and result in 12- to 14-hour rotating power outages in the main island of Luzon.\n\nThe West Philippine Sea also supplies about 20 percent of the Philippines annual fish catch, he said.\n\n\"This will be a terrible blow to poor Philippine fishermen living in provinces facing the West Philippine Sea,\" Carpio added.\n\nHe warned that if China succeeds with its claim, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea would collapse. If UNCLOS won't apply in the South China Sea, then it won't apply in the rest of the world as well, Carpio said.\n\n\"The might-is-right rule will prevail in the oceans and seas of our planet. There will be an arms race among coastal states because, without UNCLOS, the only way to protect a country's existing [EEZ] is to acquire warships, warplanes and missiles,\" he said. \"It will be a terrible world to live in.\"\n\nCapt. Carl O. Schuster, a retired U.S. Navy officer, praised the Philippines' efforts in showing the world how China is behaving in the South China Sea and how the country is pushing back against the communist nation's bullying tactics.\n\n\"The Philippines' exposure of [China's] bullying has embarrassed Beijing and forced it to change its political warfare effort,\" he said, and that none of China's claims have taken root in the international media.", "source": {"uri": "pacificislandtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pactimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He had been asked whether a deadly Chinese water cannon attack would be a red line that triggers Manila's decades-old Mutual Defense Treaty with the U.S.\n\nThe threshold for triggering the defense pact and drawing the U.S. into a conflict with nuclear-armed Beijing has been an increasingly hot topic among analysts in recent months. The Marcos administration's pushback against China's expansion in the disputed South China Sea has been met with a forceful response by the Chinese coast guard, whose water cannon barrages left several Philippine sailors injured in March.\n\nMarcos added that his country and its partners would take \"joint action,\" without naming the U.S. He pointed out that Philippine nationals had already been injured in confrontations with China but that \"thank God\" a fatality has not occurred.\n\n\"Once we get to that point, we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon,\" he added. \"Is that a red line? Almost certainly it's going to be a red line.\"\n\nChina asserts claims over nearly all of the South China Sea, citing historical rights. Its claims overlap with the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines as well as Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.\n\nAn international tribunal at the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration delivered a 2016 ruling that largely dismissed China's South China Sea claims. On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reiterated Bejing's position that the arbitral award \"is illegal, null and void\" and said \"the world is not blind to the truth.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Chinese and Philippine foreign ministries and the U.S. Department of Defense with written requests for comment.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who met with Chinese counterpart Dong Jung on the sidelines of the summit, have both stressed that America's defense commitments to its Southeast Asian ally are \"ironclad.\"",

Earlier on Friday, a Chinese military spokesman accused the Philippines of making \"provocations\".\n\nObservers fear that any escalation could spark a conflict in the South China Sea between the Chinese and Americans. The US is bound by a treaty signed with the Philippines to come to the south-east Asian nation's defence, should it come under attack.\n\nThe US has previously said it will stand by its \"ironclad\" commitments to its allies in the region, and has sought to draw them closer including holding a summit with the Philippines and Japan last month.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Marcos had just finished delivering the opening address at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore when a delegate posed a hypothetical situation where Chinese water cannon killed a Filipino soldier. He was asked if he would consider that a red line, and if this would invoke the US-Philippines treaty.\n\n\"If by a wilful act a Filipino - not only serviceman, but even Filipino citizen - is killed... that is what I think very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly. And our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard.\"\n\nHe noted that Filipinos have been injured in recent clashes, but none had been killed yet. \"Once we get to that point, that is certainly, we would have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it's going to be a red line.\"\n\nAsked by the BBC, the Chinese spokesman said that \"if one only personnel was accidentally killed in a conflict or accident that triggers war, then I really believe it's a belligerent country\".\n\nMr Marcos's government is beefing up its military spending and has acquired missiles from the US and India. It is angling to get a sizeable chunk of a proposed US military aid package for its allies in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe issue had also cropped up in a key meeting between US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun earlier on Friday.\n\nThe Chinese military said the Philippines was \"emboldened and supported by outside powers\" and \"has broken its own promises and making provocations\" over the disputed Second Thomas Shoal where Manila has established a military outpost.\n\nThey also objected to the US sending a mid-range missile system to the Philippines in a recent joint military exercise, saying it \"posed a real threat to regional security\".\n\nBut both the US and China also signalled they were keen on keeping communication lines open.\n\nA US statement on the meeting said they were working on resuming telephone conversations between military commanders - a key line of communication that was severed in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan - and on establishing a crisis communications working group.\n\nMr Wu told reporters that the meeting was \"positive, practical and constructive\". He added that the US-China relationship was \"stabilising from further deterioration\".\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel

Despite a 2016 UN ruling to the contrary, Beijing claims ownership over the territory and has harassed Filipino vessels resupplying the base each month. That harassment has included the firing of water cannons and ramming of a Filipino vessel.\n\nBut were that aggression to result in the death of a Filipino citizen, Marcos said, it would be \"very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\"\n\nThat's more than semantics.\n\nThe Philippines and America have a mutual defense treaty, dating back to the 1950s. Partly for that reason, China's behavior around the reef has been in the \"gray zone,\" or activity that falls short of full conflict. Beijing uses its Coast Guard rather than its Navy to intercept Filipino vessels. And while those forces have injured Filipinos, they haven't killed anyone.\n\nThe question then is what Manila defines as an act of war instead of harassment -- and hence what could spark a war between the U.S. and China.\n\n\"Almost certainly, it's going to be a red line,\" Marcos said of a situation in which Chinese forces kill a Filipino citizen.\n\nThe keynote address was a high platform for Marcos, and the Philippines more broadly. Manila is playing a larger role in the region's security as it deepens its security ties with Washington and other like-minded countries, such as Japan and Australia.\n\nThere's no more unifying issue for that coalition than the South China Sea, said Greg Poling, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for International and Strategic Studies.\n\n\"The South China Sea, in one way or another, resonates with pretty much all U.S. allies and partners -- even those outside the region -- because it's a question overall law,\" Poling said. \"Everyone agrees that China's in the wrong.\"",

Earlier on Friday, a Chinese military spokesman accused the Philippines of making \"provocations\".\n\nObservers fear that any escalation could spark a conflict in the South China Sea between the Chinese and Americans. The US is bound by a treaty signed with the Philippines to come to the south-east Asian nation's defence, should it come under attack.\n\nThe US has previously said it will stand by its \"ironclad\" commitments to its allies in the region, and has sought to draw them closer including holding a summit with the Philippines and Japan last month.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Marcos had just finished delivering the opening address at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore when a delegate posed a hypothetical situation where Chinese water cannon killed a Filipino soldier. He was asked if he would consider that a red line, and if this would invoke the US-Philippines treaty.\n\n\"If by a wilful act a Filipino - not only serviceman, but even Filipino citizen - is killed... that is what I think very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly. And our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard.\"\n\nHe noted that Filipinos have been injured in recent clashes, but none had been killed yet. \"Once we get to that point, that is certainly, we would have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it's going to be a red line.\"\n\nAsked by the BBC, the Chinese spokesman said that \"if one only personnel was accidentally killed in a conflict or accident that triggers war, then I really believe it's a belligerent country\".\n\nMr Marcos's government is beefing up its military spending and has acquired missiles from the US and India. It is angling to get a sizeable chunk of a proposed US military aid package for its allies in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe issue had also cropped up in a key meeting between US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun earlier on Friday.\n\nThe Chinese military said the Philippines was \"emboldened and supported by outside powers\" and \"has broken its own promises and making provocations\" over the disputed Second Thomas Shoal where Manila has established a military outpost.\n\nThey also objected to the US sending a mid-range missile system to the Philippines in a recent joint military exercise, saying it \"posed a real threat to regional security\".\n\nBut both the US and China also signalled they were keen on keeping communication lines open.\n\nA US statement on the meeting said they were working on resuming telephone conversations between military commanders - a key line of communication that was severed in 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan - and on establishing a crisis communications working group.\n\nMr Wu told reporters that the meeting was \"positive, practical and constructive\". He added that the US-China relationship was \"stabilising from further deterioration\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Accordingly, to implement maritime laws, the China Coast Guard recently issued the \"Administrative Law Enforcement Procedures for Coast Guard Institutions\" (referred to as Coast Guard Procedures).\n\nThe Coast Guard Procedures are aimed at regulating maritime law enforcement, providing a solid institutional guarantee for advancing maritime legal governance. Recently, the Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs issued a statement, claiming China's Coast Guard Procedures violate international law. This is a typical case of \"a thief crying thief\", because the Coast Guard Procedures comply with international law and customary practices.\n\nThe Coast Guard Procedures are an important component of China's policy to improve regional maritime governance and uphold the rule of law. The procedures are applicable to China's jurisdictional waters and airspace in line with international legal norms, and do not constitute \"rule-making beyond jurisdiction\".\n\nAccording to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, a country's jurisdictional waters extend beyond its internal waters and territorial seas to include contiguous zones, exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. For instance, Article 73 of UNCLOS says coastal states have the authority to take law enforcement actions such as boarding, inspection and arrest within their exclusive economic zones when exercising sovereign rights over exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of living resources.\n\nCoastal states may even pursue foreign vessels on the high seas if they have sufficient reason to believe the people operating those vessels are violating national laws and regulations.\n\nYet the Philippines claims that the application of China's Coast Guard Procedures is in violation of permissible international law boundaries, which is baseless. China's sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea have been established through historical practices, and are fully legitimate.\n\nHuangyan Island is an inalienable part of China's maritime territory -- China was the first country to discover and name Huangyan Island and has been controlling and exercising jurisdiction over it and the surrounding waters since then.\n\nOn the other hand, the Philippines' so-called South China Sea arbitration award, which unlawfully determined that the waters near Huangyan Island fall under Philippine jurisdiction and are part of the high seas, is legally untenable. The South China Sea arbitration award blatantly violated international law, including UNCLOS. It is an illegal ruling concocted by the Philippines and the United States.\n\nThe various forms of law enforcement, in accordance with the Coast Guard Procedures, are all legitimate. Hence, China's right to detain and inspect foreign nationals suspected of illegally entering or exiting its maritime territory are in line with international law and common practices. If the US Coast Guard can have the right to detain foreign individuals who illegally enter or exit its maritime territory, why can't China?\n\nIn the almost three and a half years of the Joe Biden administration, the US has detained thousands of people who illegally entered its waters. The Philippines' Coast Guard, too, has forcibly enforced the country's law and detained Chinese fishermen, accusing them of fishing illegally and causing environmental damage, posing a serious threat to Chinese nationals.\n\nThe implementation of the Coast Guard Procedures is part of China's efforts to enforce maritime law in order to improve regional maritime governance. The procedures clearly state that \"administrative law enforcement must be based on facts and guided by the law \"and should follow the principles of legality, fairness, openness, respect for and protection of human rights, and safeguarding the dignity of individuals, which is important to ensure the effectiveness and legitimacy of maritime law enforcement.\n\nThe Coast Guard Procedures also uphold international law. For instance, Article 33 of the Coast Guard Procedures states that boarding, inspection, interception and pursuit of foreign vessels should comply with the provisions of international treaties to which China is a signatory, showing China is committed to promoting the rule of law globally.\n\nSome non-regional major powers have long been meddling in the South China Sea issues, while trying to sow discord among countries around the South China Sea. Encouraged and supported by these major powers, Manila has been making one provocative move after another against Beijing.\n\nOf late, Manila has reneged on its commitments and denied the existence of a \"gentlemen's agreement\" with China, while sending its coast guard and militia vessels to Huangyan Island and Ren'ai Reef, which dangerously navigate the surrounding waters, leading to collisions with Chinese law enforcement vessels.\n\nFrom May 15 to 17, a self-proclaimed civil organization in the Philippines mobilized a group of \"local fishermen\" to enter the waters around China's Huangyan Island. To safeguard China's sovereignty, territorial integrity and maritime rights, China's Coast Guard had no choice but to take appropriate countermeasures. And despite the Philippines' repeated provocations, Chinese maritime officials have acted lawfully, professionally and in a restrained manner to maintain peace in the South China Sea.\n\nMaintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea is the common aspiration of China and neighboring countries. China has long demonstrated its goodwill toward the Philippines, by agreeing to jointly manage maritime disputes, hoping that the Philippines would abide by the agreements reached between the two sides, adhere to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to resolve the differences through negotiations.\n\nTherefore, the Philippines should return to the path of dialogue and consultation to resolve the maritime disputes, while complying with international law and respecting the agreements reached by the regional countries to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea, and refraining from exacerbating regional tensions.\n\nLi Honglei is a professor at the School of Law, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; and Sun Nanxiang is an associate

Hanoi had carried out only \u201cmodest\u201d reclamation efforts on 29 islands and reefs it controlled in the Spratly Islands, a disputed archipelago in the South China Sea, up to 2019, according to the institution.\n\nBut in recent years, Vietnam has embarked on major dredging and landfill works and expanded the reclaimed area several times, from the original 0.7 sq km (0.27 sq miles) to 3 sq km, the report\u2019s author Liu Xiaobo said.\n\nThe second report issued by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations last Thursday said potential clashes in the South China Sea could test Indonesia\u2019s ties with China.\n\nLuo Yongkun, deputy director of Southeast Asian and Oceanian Studies at the Beijing-based think tank, warned that it would require \u201csuperb political wisdom\u201d for Jakarta to maintain its friendship with Beijing amid \u201cdramatic geopolitical changes\u201d.\n\nConflict in the South China Sea would \u201cseverely\u201d test China-Indonesia ties, China-Asean relations, and even the regional order centred around Asean, said Luo, a research professor at the state-affiliated institute.\n\nThis would trigger changes in the regional geopolitical structure and risk the interests of all parties in the region, he said.\n\nThe two reports followed months of skirmishes between China and the Philippines, with Manila this week protesting Beijing\u2019s unilateral fishing ban in the South China Sea.\n\nAt a time of heightened tensions, the reports serve little purpose in reducing tension.\n\nThe scale of Vietnam\u2019s reclamation in the first report pales in comparison with Beijing\u2019s similar activities covering at least 12.9 sq km in the disputed waters almost a decade ago, highlighted in a March report by Japan\u2019s defence ministry.\n\nIn the case of Indonesia, there should be no reason for it to be singled out in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea, as Jakarta is not a claimant of maritime territory in the waterway.\n\nIndonesia, despite having Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and population, should not bear the burden of a deterioration in China-Asean ties and the break-up of the regional order.\n\nChinese think tanks have traditionally toed Beijing\u2019s line and reflected their government\u2019s position. In a report issued by European research institute Mercator Institute for China Studies this month, China has, over the past decade, pushed \u201cto closer align think tanks\u2019 activities with political agendas\u201d.\n\n\u201cDue to the changing policy environment \u2026 room for truly independent think tanks has become negligible,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors Nis Gr\u00fcnberg and Grzegorz Stec.\n\nApart from being poorly timed, the reports have unnecessarily targeted Vietnam and Indonesia and even appeared to have pushed the blame in rising South China Sea tensions on Hanoi and Jakarta.\n\nGiven the current skirmishes between Beijing and Manila in the disputed waterway, the best ways to ease tension would be to exercise caution at sea and for external countries to diplomatically engage China and the Philippines.\n\nSingling out other parties \u2013 Vietnam and Indonesia \u2013 is simply an attempt to divert attention from the maritime confrontation, and even drama, that is unfolding in the South China Sea, of which China\u2019s substantive and contributory role should not be overlooked.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South

{"id": 227750348, "title": "Rock on, Shostakovich, Handel, Ravel: lives of great composers hit the screens", "text": "After the recent success of biopics about pop and rock legends including Elvis, Freddie Mercury and Bob Marley, film-makers are now finding inspiration in the troubled and tragic lives of classical music\u2019s greatest composers. Almost 40 years after Milo\u0161 For-man\u2019s Amadeus won eight Oscars, a remake of the fictionalised Mozart drama about genius and jealousy is planned as a major television series starring Paul Bettany. Meanwhile feature films are being made about Dmitri Shostakovich, George Frideric Han-del, Richard Wagner and Joseph Bologne. Bol\u00e9ro, a film about French composer Maurice Ravel, had its premiere at the International Film Festival Rotterdam earlier this year. The projects follow the Oscar-nominated Maestro, released 18 months ago, in which Bradley Cooper portrayed Leonard Bernstein, the composer and conductor. Christopher Hampton, who won Oscars for Dangerous Liaisons and The Father, has written the screenplay for a new feature film about Shostakovich. Asked why so many film-makers are now looking at the lives of classical composers, he said: \u201cMaybe the film Maestro fed into this a bit. Maybe it made people think you can make such films. \u201cFinanciers are naturally suspicious about anything to do with art. But composers often do lead very interesting lives. It\u2019s not like writing about writers, which is really difficult, as you watch them with a pen and a bit of paper.\u201d Hampton has written the screenplay for The Noise of Time, based on Julian Barnes\u2019s novel, a fictionalised retelling of Shostakovich\u2019s life under Stalin that was described by the Observer as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. Its story brings out the torment experienced by Shostakovich who, like all Soviet composers, was required to compose music that embraced the ideals of patriotism for \u2018Mother Russia\u2019. With the state watching his every move, he fell foul of the regime. He said: \u201cThe unique thing about him was that he \u2026 chose to stay, rather than becoming an \u00e9migr\u00e9 like all the rest of them. So the story is about an artist trying to work out ways to maintain his integrity while doing what he was told.\u201d Hampton, who is rehearsing his latest play, Visit From An Unknown Woman, an adaptation of a Stefan Zweig short story, which will have its English-language premiere at the Hampstead Theatre in north London later this month added: \u201c[Shostakovich] was the adored wunderkind of Russia but, after the act II interval of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk \u2013 which had been a huge success \u2013 he looked up at the box and Stalin and the politburo had not come back. Three days later, he was denounced in Pravda. \u201cThe rest of his life was a misery \u2026 They wouldn\u2019t even give him enough paper. Composers used to have to be issued composition paper from the composers\u2019 union. He turned up one year and they gave him a tenth of what [he] was used to.\u201d The film, directed by Jan Komasa, will reflect that, despite tragedy and oppression, Shostakovich could never suppress his humour, Hampton said. \u201cHe used to make a toast every New Year\u2019s Eve saying: let\u2019s drink in the hope that things will not get better.\u201d August Diehl, whose acclaimed films include Terrence Malick\u2019s wartime drama A Hidden Life, has been cast as the composer. Andrea Riseborough, who received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of an alcoholic single mother in To Leslie, will play his wife, Nita. A film about Handel, entitled The King of Covent Garden, will star Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins as the German-born son of a surgeon who became a British citizen in 1727, and is scheduled for release late next year. Its story is set during the period that he worked on his choral master-piece Messiah. The film-makers describe it as \u201ca powerfully majestic celebration of genius breaking all the rules\u201d. The Ravel film, Bol\u00e9ro, has been sold to 20 countries, while a UK distributor is yet to be found. Warner Classics has released an album of its soundtrack. It is directed and co-written by Anne Fontaine, with Rapha\u00ebl Personnaz portraying Ravel and cele-brated French pianist Alexandre Tharaud playing \u201cRavel\u2019s hands\u201d and the piano parts heard in the film. Fontaine wanted to discover Ravel through his \u201cbewitching\u201d 1928 composition Bol\u00e9ro. The composer himself once said: \u201cI have composed only one masterpiece, and that is Bol\u00e9ro; unfortunately, it is devoid of music.\u201d Fontaine said: \u201cHow can we not feel empathy with this character who dislikes his own creation?\u201d While Sky is adapting Peter Shaf-fer\u2019s award-winning stage play Ama-deus into a series starring Will Sharpe as Mozart and Paul Bettany as his fierce rival Salieri, US film-maker Solomon J LeFlore is developing a major movie about their contemporary, Joseph Bologne, who was born into slavery and went on to become a violin virtuoso and composer. The son of a plantation owner and a teenage Senegalese enslaved woman, Bologne became a composer in Marie Antoinette\u2019s court, wrote symphonies, concertos and string quartets \u2013 many lost during the French Revolution \u2013 and was described by the former US president John Adams as \u201cthe most accomplished man in Europe\u201d. The film, Le Chevalier: Beauty and Betrayal, portrays him as a \u201ctransformational renaissance man and abolitionist, whose story is of such importance today, but whose name has long been neglected in western classical music tradition\u201d, LeFlore said. In the forthcoming Wagner in Ven-ice, writer-director Daniel Graham fictionalises the composer\u2019s final months in his beloved Venice with his wife, Cosima, and her father, Franz Liszt. Graham said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that we\u2019re in the middle of a period of great interest in biopics of artists and musicians. Their lives defy the norm, exceed the possible, and therefore appeal to an audience wanting to celebrate this.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Torment, rebellion and tragedy are major themes as a rash of new biopics highlight the achievements and challenges of the musically gifted </p><p>After the recent success of biopics about pop and rock legends including Elvis, Freddie Mercury and Bob Marley, film-makers are now finding inspiration in the troubled and tragic lives of classical music\u2019s greatest composers.</p><p>Almost 40 years after Milo\u0161 For\u00adman\u2019s <em>Amadeus</em> won eight Oscars, a remake of the fictionalised Mozart drama about genius and jealousy is planned as a major television series starring Paul Bettany.

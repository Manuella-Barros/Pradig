The actor reveals why he turned down the starring role in a cancelled Superman film by director Brett Ratner.\n\nThe Superman IP was in an odd state in the early 2000s. Dozens of cancelled projects laid in the bin following the Richard Donner franchise ending, ultimately culminating in Suprman Returns, which many describe as rather subpar and led to let another period of dormancy of the character on the big screen until Zack Snyder's Man of Steel.\n\nHowever, in the midst of all of this drama, there was an idea for a Superman film directed by Brett Ratner, best known for his work with the Rush Hour franchise. When the studio was developing the film, only one actor was on their minds to play the Man of Steel. Somehow, that actor was Jude Law.\n\nA quarter century divorced from the idea, fans know that Superman incarnation never came to life, with Jude Law turning down the project and the film eventually falling apart. However, it's never been clear why Law rejected the Man of Steel. When asked during a recent podcast appearance, he admitted it simply felt \"too far\" for him.\n\n\"So this is true. Yeah. And there was a process of flirtation going on,\" Law told The Discourse podcast. \"And I always resisted because it just felt like [off]. And I know you can say, 'Well, but you played Yonn-Rogg and Dumbledore!' It just felt like a step too far.\"\n\nHe added, \"And it was when Brett Ratner was going to direct, I think. And they didn't have a script, if I remember rightly. Did they have a script? I don't remember reading one. This is a long time ago. They brought me the suit. They thought, 'This might change your mind.'\"\n\n\"No, it wasn't the Reeve suit. It was a kind of like it was more metallic,\" he said. \"Anyway, I tried on and I looked in the mirror and part of me initially was like, 'Wow, this would be a [good thing],' and then I just thought, 'No, you can't - you can't do this. You can't.' And I didn't sell myself to myself. And I stepped away and the film never happened anyway. So maybe it probably wouldn't have done anything.\"\n\nIt certainly would have been interesting to see Jude Law transform into the Man of Steel on the silver screen. However, given the track record of DC at the time, it's likely for the best that Brett Ratner's Superman film never saw the light of day.

However, he regret one of his decision in his career. Law turned down Superman role in the early 2000s because \"it just felt off,\" which he knows sounds hilarious given that he went on to feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and as Dumbledore in the 'Fantastic Beasts' movie, reported Variety.\n\nThe actor claimed that he was approached to portray the Man of Steel in Brett Ratner's failed Superman project, which was announced in 2002 and was based on an iteration of J.J. Abrams' 'Superman: Flyby' script.\n\nAlso Read | Chandu Champion Actor Aniruddh Dave on How Actors From NSD and FTII Are Now 'Real Stars' (LatestLY Exclusive).\n\n\"So this is true. Yeah. And there was a process of flirtation going on,\" Law said. \"And I always resisted because it just felt like off. And I know you can say, 'Well, but you played Yonn-Rogg and Dumbledore!' It just felt like a step too far,\" he added.\n\n\"It was when Brett Ratner was going to direct, I think.

They thought, 'This might change your mind.'\"\n\nEven testing on the outfit didn't persuade Law that he should portray Superman. Despite speculations to the contrary, Law did not test on Christopher Reeves' original Superman outfit, opting for something \"more metallic.\"\n\n\"Anyway, I tried it on and I looked in the mirror and part of me initially was like, 'Wow, this would be a good thing,' and then I just thought, 'No, you can't - you can't do this.

In a different world, Sean Connery would have assembled a fellowship to take the One Ring to Mordor. Were it not for Eyes Wide Shut running late, Dougray Scott would be the one popping adamantium claws from his knuckles. Will Smith was almost Neo in The Matrix! Hilarious possibilities that were almost realities. One character that is no stranger to casting close calls is Superman.\n\nMany people have almost portrayed the Big Blue Boy Scout. Clint Eastwood was approached for the 1978 Richard Donner film (as were a slew of Hollywood superstars). Nicholas Cage was famously picked to play Supes for a Tim Burton-directed film that never came to fruition. Ashton Kutcher was close to playing Superman in a Superman movie directed by Brett Ratner who also never saw the light of day. He wasn't the only one.\n\nJude Law has had an impressive career. He has been prolific on both stage and screen. The actor has earned Oscar and Tony nominations. The man has big, doughy eyes that look like pools you can swim in. Hell, the man splayed Sky Captain himself, Joseph Sullivan! You know! From the wildly successful SCCU (Sky Captain Cinematic Universe). Am I making that up? Regardless, the actor has seen much success, which almost included popping on some red trunks.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Playlist, Law reflected on almost playing Superman. \"So, this is true. Yeah. And there was a process of flirtation going on,\" he explained. \"And I always resisted because it just felt like [off]. And I know you can say, 'Well, but you played Yonn-Rogg and Dumbledore!' It just felt like a step too far.\" It's a fair reason to turn the role down. Most people wouldn't know what you mean if you asked who Yonn-Rogg is. Everyone knows Superman.\n\nLaw was up for Supes at the same time Kutcher was, given the director offering him the role. He told The Playlist, \"And it was when Brett Ratner was going to direct, I think. And they didn't have a script if I remember rightly. Did they have a script? I don't remember reading one. This is a long time ago. They brought me the suit. They thought, 'This might change your mind.'\"\n\nAn interesting wrinkle here is that Law was not sent the Christopher Reeve suit, as is usually the case. They had a completely different suit for him to try on. \"No, it wasn't the Reeve suit. It was a kind of like, it was more metallic,\" Law explained. \"Anyway, I tried on and I looked in the mirror and part of me initially was like, 'Wow, this would be a [good thing]' and then I just thought, 'No, you can't -- you can't do this. You can't.' And I didn't sell myself to myself. And I stepped away and the film never happened anyway.

However, even if that version of the Last Son of Krypton had taken flight, it's highly unlikely Law would have seized the aforementioned opportunity because he felt like playing that role would have been \"a step too far.\" Law said during an interview on The Discourse podcast (per The Playlist):\n\nThis is true, yeah. And there was a process of flirtation going on. And I always resisted because it just felt like [it was off]. And I know you can say, 'Well, but you played Yonn-Rogg and Dumbledore!' It just felt like a step too far.\n\nSuperman Returns PG-13SuperheroActionAdventureSci-Fi Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date June 30, 2006 Director Bryn Singer Cast Brandon Routh , Kevin Spacey , Kate Bosworth , James Marsden , Parker Posey , Frank Langella , Sam Huntington , Eva Marie Saint Runtime 154 Minutes\n\nLaw continued:\n\n\"And it was when Brett Ratner was going to direct, I think. And they didn't have a script, if I remember rightly. Did they have a script? I don't remember reading one. This is a long time ago. They brought me the suit. They thought, 'This might change your mind.'\"\n\nJude Law Insists, 'No, It Wasn't the Reeve Suit' Close\n\nSuperman Returns ranks at the top of the best films made featuring the Man of Steel. Ultimately, Bryan Singer ended up directing the Last Son of Krypton's 2006 big-screen adventure, while Brett Ratner went on to helm X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). And Brandon Routh suited up as the all-powerful Kryptonian rather than Jude Law. However, Law did try on the famed Superman suit, but it wasn't the one worn by the late Christopher Reeve. Law said in the same sit-down:\n\n\"No, it wasn't the Reeve suit. It was a kind of like... it was more metallic. Anyway, I tried [it] on, and I looked in the mirror and part of me initially was like, 'Wow, this would be a [good thing],' and then I just thought, 'No, you can't - you can't do this. You can't.' And I didn't sell myself to myself. And I stepped away. A nd the film never happened anyway. So, maybe it probably wouldn't have done anything.\"\n\nRelated 10 Marvel Characters Who Are Basically Superman\n\nImitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but some of Marvel's versions of Superman are a little too close to the original for comfort.\n\nSeven years passed after the release of Superman Returns before Henry Cavill took up the mantle of Kal-El and his alter ego, Clark Kent, in director Zack Snyder's Man of Steel (2013). Today, Law isn't a part of the Kryptonian's vast and rich film legacy, but Routh -- even though he only played Superman once on the Silver Screen -- returned to the role in The CW's crossover saga, which was known as the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Routh portrayed a DC Elseworlds' variant of Kingdom Come and Injustice's Man of Steel on television.\n\nSuperman Returns is available to stream on Max, at the time of this writing.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(DC_Extended_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superman (DC Extended Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Law", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Ratner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brett Ratner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Reeve", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Reeve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Gunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_Returns_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superman Returns (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krypton (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Singer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Singer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Abrams - was just one of several that Warner Bros. was trying to produce to revive the franchise. But Jude Law wasn't the only one in the running, as Matt Bomer was considered and a costume test for Josh Hartnett has been floating around.\n\nHonestly, it's a little tough to see Jude Law as Superman, as talented as the guy is. To me, he gives off more of a villainous vibe and may have fared better as someone like The Riddler for a '90s Batman movie.\n\nThe franchise would eventually land on Brandon Routh for Superman Returns before Henry Cavill would don the cape for a series of movies. Now we have David Corenswet and his own costume to look forward to as he will star in James Gunn's movie, set for a July 11th, 2025 release.\n\nHow do you think Jude Law would have done as Superman?

Jude Law turned down playing Superman in the early 2000s, he confirmed in a new interview with The Playlist's \"Discourse\" podcast. According to Variety, the actor would've played the Man of Steel in Brett Ratner's take on the iconic superhero based on a script from J.J. Abrams known as \"Superman: Flyby.\" The project never took off, though, and the character didn't appear on the big screen until Brandon Routh put on the cape for 2006's \"Superman Returns.\" Law said he tried on a \"more metallic\" version of Christopher Reeves' original Superman suit, but still felt uncomfortable - despite eventually appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and playing Dumbledore in \"Fantastic Beasts.\" \"I always resisted because it just felt like [off]. And I know you can say, 'Well, but you played Yonn-Rogg and Dumbledore!' It just felt like a step too far,\" he told \"Discourse.\" \"Anyway, I tried it on and I looked in the mirror and part of me initially was like, 'Wow, this would be a [good thing],' and then I just thought, 'No, you can't - you can't do this.

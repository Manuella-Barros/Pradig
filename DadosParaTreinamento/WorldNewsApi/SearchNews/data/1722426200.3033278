If you loved Dynasty Mode in NCAA Football and have been waiting for information on the feature in College Football 25, circle July 2 on your calendars. Per EA's Scott O'Gallagher, a massive 16,000-word, 80-page deep dive will be released on July 1 to answer all of the lingering questions about arguably the most-missed mode from the series' lineage. The primary questions fans still have are as follows. How Limited Will the Player Editing Be in College Football 25? Because of the addition of NIL players in this year's game, users won't have as much freedom to edit players as in the NCAA Football series. I uncovered this during a preview of the game. When I asked EA's developers for details in May, they could only share some information. We hope to gain clarity on what we can and can't change with every player in every school.

The most exciting detail attached to the return of EA's College Football brand is resurfacing the web-based Team Builder option. The website EA provided over a decade ago is still better than some games offer today. Considering we were told this feature's current level of complexity and customization is beyond what we saw before, there is reason for excitement. Team Builder could cover some ground lost by the understandable customization limitations created by including NIL players. What Will In-Season Presentation Look and Sound Like In College Football 25? We saw College Football 25's impressive Sights and Sounds deep-dive trailer earlier this week, but there was little reference to the Dynasty-specific presentation. One of the most important elements to capture in any franchise mode is the presentation that adds to the Immersion. Will we see special halftime shows that offer highlights from other games around the Top 25? Will there be some sort of weekly wrap-up show during a Dynasty mode? Are we going to hear commentators refer to situations directly connected to the college football world you've created? I'd be surprised if that level of presentation were in this first year's version of the reboot. Those enhancements seem significant enough to have been put out front at some point, and I don't recall hearing that during the preview presentation. As it is, it will still be good to learn about what makes Dynasty Mode gameplay different from the experience in every other part of the game. College Football 25 releases on July 19 for PlayStation 5 and X Box Series X/S. Follow me on Twitter.

Abortion -- both medical and surgical -- is illegal in Louisiana, so it is already illegal to prescribe the medications to terminate a pregnancy, except in very limited circumstances.\n\nMedication abortions accounted for 63% of all abortions in 2023, according to the reproductive rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThe bill passed Tuesday in a vote in the state's GOP-controlled House of Representatives, 64-29.\n\nThe legislation would make possession of the medications without a valid prescription or an order from a medical professional punishable by up to five years in prison. Pregnant people who obtain the medications for their own consumption would not be subject to prosecution, according to the legislation.\n\nMedical professionals have spoken out against the measure, saying the medications have critical uses outside of abortion care, including aiding in labor and delivery, miscarriage treatment, and the prevention of gastrointestinal ulcers.\n\nSchedule IV substances include some narcotics; medications within the category of depressants, such as Xanax and Valium; muscle relaxants; sleep aids; and stimulants that can be used to treat ADHD and weight loss.\n\nThe bill, Senate Bill 276, would also criminalize \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud,\" which would prohibit someone from knowingly using the medications to cause or attempt to cause an abortion without the consent of the pregnant person. That would be punishable by up to 10 years, or up to 20 years if the pregnant person was three months or more into a pregnancy.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, who introduced the bill, has said the issue is personal to him and his sister, Catherine Herring. Herring's estranged husband was accused of slipping abortion medication into her drinks when she was pregnant with their third child. Mason Herring pleaded guilty to the allegations in February and was sentenced to 180 days in jail.\n\nBut doctors and reproductive rights advocates have expressed alarm at the bill, which would make Louisiana the only state to categorize the two medications as controlled dangerous substances.\n\n\"They are safe and effective and they are not dangerous drugs of abuse to be on a schedule of a controlled dangerous substance list,\" Dr. Jennifer Avegno, an emergency medicine physician and the director of the New Orleans Health Department, told NBC News on Tuesday. \"From a medical standpoint, healthcare providers think this is bad science, and not well informed.\"\n\n\"This is not about abortion. This is about using these drugs, routinely for many, many other things.

As stated previously, abortion is already illegal in Louisiana.\"\n\nAfter it was introduced in the House Tuesday afternoon, State Rep. Mandie Landry, a Democrat, called for a motion to recommit the bill to the legislature's Health and Welfare Committee because of the amendment that would recategorize the medications as controlled dangerous substances.\n\n\"This amendment is about rescheduling drugs that are used every single day to induce labor, to manage miscarriages, to manage post-hemorrhage issues with a pregnancy,\" she said.\n\nLandry said the recategorization would require certain storage facilities to store the drugs, which could potentially hurt the ability of rural clinics to access them and provide them to patients.\n\n\"I think it's horrible how this good bill was hijacked by outsiders who are not doctors, and aren't even legislators,\" she said.\n\nLandry's motion was voted down, 66-30.\n\nRep.

This bill, which passed with a vote of 64-29, seeks to classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifepristone as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants, CNN reported.\n\nSponsored by Republican state Sen Thomas Pressly, Senate Bill 276 aims to criminalize the administration of abortion medication without consent.\n\nThe amendment to classify these drugs as Schedule IV substances was introduced after the bill passed out of the Senate, highlighting the contentious nature of the issue.\n\nPressly's motivation for proposing this legislation stems from personal experience, as he revealed that his sister was given misoprostol against her will. It's important to note that abortion is already banned in Louisiana without exceptions for cases of rape or incest, making this bill even more restrictive, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe process of a medication abortion involves taking mifepristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone necessary for pregnancy continuation, followed by misoprostol within the next 24 to 48 hours to induce uterine contractions.\n\nWhile misoprostol has been available at pharmacies for decades and is approved for various medical uses, including preventing stomach ulcers, its inclusion in this bill as a controlled substance raises significant concerns.\n\nUnder the amended bill, possessing these drugs without a valid prescription could result in felony charges, punishable by up to five years in prison and fines of up to USD 5,000. However, there is an exemption for pregnant individuals in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption, and doctors would still be able to prescribe the drugs, according to CNN.\n\nDespite the bill's passage in the House, it has faced widespread criticism from various quarters. Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the bill as \"absolutely unconscionable,\" attributing it to the policies of former President Donald Trump. Conversely, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill's passage, framing it as a necessary measure to prevent drug abuse while ensuring access for legitimate medical reasons, such as miscarriage care.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the bill has sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers, and medical students, who signed a letter expressing concerns over the reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol. They argue that these drugs have not been shown to have any potential for abuse or dependence and are widely prescribed and taken safely for medical purposes.\n\nIn response to these concerns, Pressly defended the bill, asserting that it would not prohibit the prescription or dispensation of mifepristone and misoprostol for legitimate medical reasons. He further stated that the provision would not harm healthcare for women, citing consultations with medical professionals.\n\nIf the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed by the House, it will proceed to the desk of Republican Gov Jeff Landry for final approval. If signed into law, Louisiana would become the only state to classify abortion drugs as controlled dangerous substances, potentially setting a precedent for other states to follow suit, CNN reported.

The bill heads to the Senate next.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 to end pregnancy, when used in combination with misoprostol. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in March on behalf of doctors who oppose abortion and want to restrict access to mifepristone. The justices did not appear ready to limit access to the pill, however.\n\nThe reclassification of the two drugs in Louisiana is an amendment to a bill originating in the Senate that would create the crime of \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud,\" prohibiting a person from knowingly using medications to cause or attempt to cause an abortion without the pregnant person's knowledge or consent. The bill as amended must now return to the Senate. Specifically, the amendment aims to label the medications as Schedule IV drugs under the state\u00b4s Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law.\n\nThe bill, with the amendment, passed in Louisiana\u00b4s GOP-controlled House, 66-30.\n\nLouisiana has a near-total abortion ban in place, which applies both to medical and surgical abortions. The only exceptions to the ban are if there is substantial risk of death or impairment to the mother if she continues the pregnancy or in the case of \"medically futile\" pregnancies - when the fetus has a fatal abnormality.\n\nFILE - Boxes of the drug mifepristone sit on a shelf at the West Alabama Women's Center in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on March 16, 2022.

A second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding.

This bill, which passed with a vote of 64-29, seeks to classify the abortion-inducing drugs misoprostol and mifepristone as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances, placing them in the same category as highly regulated drugs such as narcotics and depressants, CNN reported. Sponsored by Republican state Sen Thomas Pressly, Senate Bill 276 aims to criminalize the administration of abortion medication without consent.\n\nThe amendment to classify these drugs as Schedule IV substances was introduced after the bill passed out of the Senate, highlighting the contentious nature of the issue. Pressly's motivation for proposing this legislation stems from personal experience, as he revealed that his sister was given misoprostol against her will. It's important to note that abortion is already banned in Louisiana without exceptions for cases of rape or incest, making this bill even more restrictive, as reported by CNN.\n\nThe process of a medication abortion involves taking mifepristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone necessary for pregnancy continuation, followed by misoprostol within the next 24 to 48 hours to induce uterine contractions.

However, there is an exemption for pregnant individuals in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption, and doctors would still be able to prescribe the drugs, according to CNN. Despite the bill's passage in the House, it has faced widespread criticism from various quarters. Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the bill as \"absolutely unconscionable,\" attributing it to the policies of former President Donald Trump. Conversely, the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill's passage, framing it as a necessary measure to prevent drug abuse while ensuring access for legitimate medical reasons, such as miscarriage care.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the bill has sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers, and medical students, who signed a letter expressing concerns over the reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol. They argue that these drugs have not been shown to have any potential for abuse or dependence and are widely prescribed and taken safely for medical purposes. In response to these concerns, Pressly defended the bill, asserting that it would not prohibit the prescription or dispensation of mifepristone and misoprostol for legitimate medical reasons.

The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added after it passed out of the Senate.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIn a medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.\n\nThe amended bill would make it a felony - punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 - for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription.\n\nThe legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs.\n\nIn Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000.\n\n\"Absolutely unconscionable,\" Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X in response to the bill's House passage Tuesday night, adding, \"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this.\"\n\nThe anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill's passage.\n\n\"Adding abortion drugs to the controlled substance list should be uncontroversial. Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons - like miscarriage care - but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\" Caitlin Connors, the group's southern regional director, said in a news release.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification.\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \"neither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\"\n\nThe letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \"the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\" and that they are \"widely prescribed and taken safely.\"\n\nPressly rebutted the letter's claims in a response he shared with CNN last week: \"If enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\"\n\n\"The doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\" he continued.\n\nIf the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed out of the House, it will next head to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. If Landry were to sign the bill into law, Louisiana would become the only state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peptic ulcer disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progesterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_B._Anthony_Pro-Life_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susan B.

Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, to remove the part of the proposed law that would make misoprostol and mifepristone controlled dangerous substances and send the bill to the Health and Welfare Committee for more vetting were voted down.\n\nIt will now return to the Senate for a largely procedural vote before heading to Gov. Jeff Landry's desk, a staunch conservative and outspoken opponent of abortion. If it is signed into law, it would take effect Oct. 1, 2024.\n\nThe bill was originally crafted by Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, in support of his sister, Texas resident Catherine Herring. Her husband put an abortion-inducing drug in her drink without her knowledge or consent. Her pregnancy continued, but her daughter was born ten weeks early and receives therapy several times per week. Her husband received 180 days in jail after pleading guilty to drugging her.\n\nAs a result, Pressly created the legislation outlining the crime of \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud.\"\n\nHe added the amendment to make the drugs controlled dangerous substances during a House committee hearing on April 30. The amendment was created with input from the anti-abortion group Louisiana Right to Life.\n\nMandie Landry said what was originally a good bill was \"hijacked by outsiders who are not doctors and aren't even legislators,\" referring to the Right to Life group.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Pressly, Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, acknowledged that criminalizing possession of the medications made the bill controversial and that it likely would have passed unanimously without the amendment. But she emphasized that there would be \"nothing stopping prescribing physicians from utilizing these,\" characterizing the amendment as giving law enforcement more tools to punish people with criminal intent.\n\nThe bill punishes anyone in possession of misoprostol or mifepristone without a valid prescription with up to 10 years in prison and up to a $75,000 fine. There is an exception for pregnant women. The drugs are part of a two-step regimen to induce abortion approved by the Food and Drug Administration in pregnancies up to around 10 weeks, but both have other clinical uses.\n\nMifepristone lowers the hormone progesterone, which is necessary for a pregnancy to continue. It is also used to treat a hormonal disorder called Cushing's disease.\n\nMisoprostol causes the uterus to contract. It's also used regularly in reproductive care to treat a miscarriage, induce labor, aid IUD insertion, and to treat ulcers, among other things.\n\nAn additional amendment was added that would require The Louisiana Board of Pharmacy to notify all pharmacists of the law.\n\nBill pushback\n\nPhysicians who opposed the bill said their objection was not about abortion, which has been banned in Louisiana in nearly all instances since the summer of 2022. Rather, they are concerned that making it more onerous to prescribe misoprostol and mifepristone will delay their use, leading to more dire situations for pregnant and postpartum women.\n\nHundreds of doctors signed letters against adding the two medications to the state's list of controlled dangerous substances. In a letter to Sen. Pressly, nearly 300 Louisiana physicians and medical students said that classifying the drugs alongside medications like Xanax and Valium would result in \"fear and confusion among patients, doctors and pharmacists, which delays care and worsens outcomes.\"\n\nThe law considers several factors in categorizing drugs as controlled dangerous substances, including potential for abuse and risk to public health.\n\nThe doctors said the pills don't meet the criteria to be included on the schedule, which was created to curb misuse of drugs.\n\nLouisiana Right to Life, in a press release, said that the drugs are being abused because they are available online without a prescription or screening from a doctor, citing instances of minors obtaining the pills past the limit recommended by the FDA.\n\nThe group said the new classification should not impact doctors' ability to prescribe the drugs for legitimate purposes, but would help crack down on Louisiana residents ordering the pills from out-of-state sources to manage their own abortions.\n\nA letter from the board of the Louisiana Society for Addiction Medicine signed by President Dr. Smita Prasad, however, said the bill would not prevent people from ordering pills by mail, but would result in more deaths among post-partum women by making them harder for physicians and patients to access.\n\nDrugs on the state's list of controlled dangerous substances require a special license and have stricter storage requirements. Patients and prescribing doctors are tracked by the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_woodruff@nola.com", "name": "Emily Woodruff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandie_Landry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mandie Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cushing's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progesterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/25/b25dc6e6-1785-11ef-ae80-53d7af745743/657cae062afd8.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1372, "textEnd": 1380}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

It will now be sent back to the Senate for concurrence, and then on to the desk of Gov. Jeff Landry (R).\n\nIf it is signed into law as expected, Louisiana will become the first state in the country to consider the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol in the same category as narcotics and depressants, making their possession without a valid prescription a crime punishable by fines of up to $5,000 and years-long jail terms.\n\nThe bill allows Louisiana doctors to prescribe the drug. It also includes an exemption for pregnant women who obtain the abortion drugs for their own consumption. Vice President Kamala Harris was among those who expressed horror at its passage in the House, tweeting on Tuesday night that it was \"absolutely unconscionable.\"\n\n\"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this,\" she added.\n\nAbortion is already banned in Louisiana under most circumstances except to save the life of the mother or because the pregnancy is \"medically futile.\" There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nState Sen. Thomas Pressly (R) is responsible for the bill's introduction. The proposed legislation began as a means of making a crime out of \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud\" -- in other words, using the drugs to induce an abortion without the consent of the pregnant person.\n\nThe lawmaker has explained that the issue had had a personal impact on him and his loved ones. Pressly's sister, Catherine Herring, consumed abortion pills without her knowledge when she was given them by her estranged husband. Mason Herring pleaded guilty to charges of injury to a child and assault of a pregnant person earlier this year and was sentenced to 180 days behind bars.\n\nHe only attached the amendment to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol after the bill's unanimous passage in the Senate last month.\n\n\"Everyone was blindsided. This was attached to a very specific bill -- in response to the horrible thing that happened to his sister,\" state Rep. Mandie Landry (D) said Monday, according to The Washington Post. \"Then this different issue comes in. It was like the senator pulled a fast one. Changing the category of the medications is just malicious, and now every conservative state in the country will be copying it.\"\n\nThe bill's introduction was also met with fierce blowback from hundreds of Louisiana healthcare providers, who signed a letter to Pressly protesting its potential passage. The letter, obtained by CNN, stresses that mifepristone and misoprostol are \"widely prescribed and taken safely,\" that they are non-addictive, and that reclassifying them would create \"the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation.\"\n\nPressly told the network that the doctors he had consulted with about the legislation \"feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diazepam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alprazolam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2250,w_4000,x_0,y_260/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1716415997/GettyImages-1241524154_ni0j5b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Criminalizing the possession of mifepristone and misoprostol - used to induce abortions for anyone without a prescription.\"\n\nJackson did manage to interview the bill's primary sponsor, State Sen. Thomas Pressly, where she recalled \"his sister was given an abortion drug while pregnant without her consent.\"\n\nHowever, Jackson left out the details. Catherine Herring, was six to eight weeks pregnant with her daughter when she began to suspect that her husband, Mason, was spiking her water with abortion pills. In Louisiana, mifepristone and misoprostol can be easily obtained through the mail or picked up out of state. Herring installed cameras in her home which revealed that she was taking abortion pills against her consent. In February of this year, Mason Herring pleaded guilty to injuring a child and the assault of a pregnant woman. He was sentenced to six months in jail.\n\nPressly filed Senate Bill 276 to criminalize the possession of abortion drugs without a prescription. He stated, \"My goal is certainly not to prevent women from getting the access to these pills when they need them. It is to simply say when you're a bad actor in possession of these pills that you should be held accountable.\"\n\nThe bill also makes it a crime to slip abortion pills to a pregnant woman without her given consent. With a prescription, individuals will be able to use these drugs. The purpose of this bill is to raise awareness on how dangerous these pills can be to your health if not taken with a doctor's permission and guidance.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop Jackson from fear-mongering. She cited doctors in Louisiana who believe that this bill will \"create confusion and misinformation\" since the drugs can also be used after a miscarriage or to induce labor.\n\nBut as Pressly himself noted, he isn't banning the drugs. An individual will just need to obtain a prescription of it from their doctor.\n\nCRAIG MELVIN: The battle over reproductive rights, a key issue in the 2024 race has escalated. In a first of its kind move, lawmakers in Louisiana have now passed a bill to reclassify two commonly used drugs in abortions as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" NBC's senior Washington correspondent, Hallie Jackson, is following this one for us.

If the governor does ultimately sign this bill into law, and he's expected to, Louisiana would be the first state in the country to criminalize these abortion drugs in this way but critics fear it may not be the last.\n\nA new front line this morning in the battle over abortion access.\n\nLOUISIANA POLITICIAN: And the bill is finally passed.\n\nJACKSON: Louisiana lawmakers moving forward with a plan to put two abortion drugs in the same category as so-called \"controlled dangerous substances\" like depressants and stimulants. Criminalizing the possession of mifepristone and misoprostol - used to induce abortions for anyone without a prescription.\n\nJULIE EMERSON (Republican Louisiana State Representative): When over utilized, this drug can be incredibly harmful.\n\nJACKSON: The bill's author says his sister was given an abortion drug while pregnant without her consent.\n\nTHOMAS PRESSLY: My goal is certainly not to prevent women from getting the access to these pills when they need them. It is to simply say when you're a bad actor in possession of these pills that you should be held accountable.\n\nJACKSON: But critics question how the state could enforce the proposal and warn it may have a chilling effect.\n\nAIMEE ADATTO FREEMAN (Democratic Louisiana State Representative): Let me tell you something, 50th in maternal outcomes is not pro-life.\n\nJACKSON: Two hundred eighty Louisiana doctors in a letter say reclassifying the drugs is \"not scientifically based\" and \"creates confusion and misinformation\" considering the drugs are also used after miscarriages and to induce labor.\n\nNICOLE FREEHILL (Louisiana Obstetrician and Gynecologist): Only a very small percentage of the time are they utilized for abortion care.\n\nJACKSON: Louisiana already has one of the most restrictive laws in the country banning both medication and surgical abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest, only for the life of the mother. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade more than a dozen states have put in place stricter abortion laws, raising the political stakes on reproductive rights heading into November.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Melvin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Craig Melvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freemasonry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hallie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRC-TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WRC-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_induction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labor induction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

It now moves to the Senate, and if approved will be sent to the governor to sign into law.\n\nLegislators added this amendment to a previous Senate bill that would make it a crime to give the abortion medication to someone without their consent.\n\nThe Senate bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the measure after his sister was given misoprostol two years ago without her knowledge by her husband at the time.\n\nIn a statement, Pressly said he was seeking to \"control the rampant illegal distribution of abortion-inducing drugs\" in the state, adding that abortion medication \"is frequently abused and is a risk to the health of citizens.\"\n\nIf approved, the amended bill would make it a felony with fines of up to $5,000 and a possible five-year prison sentence for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription.\n\nThe proposed measure would place mifepristone and misoprostol under the state's Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law that regulates depressants, opioids, and other potentially addicted drugs.\n\nThe two drugs are usually used in conjunction to end a pregnancy, although misoprostol could be used alone for an abortion. Medicated abortions now account for 63% of abortions in the U.S., according to the Guttmacher Institute, which conducts research on abortion and reproductive health.\n\nA group of more than 200 doctors in the state wrote a letter to Pressly objecting to the measure they said was not \"scientifically based\" and also pointed out that misoprostol can also be used to prevent gastrointestinal ulcers and to aid in labor and delivery.\n\nSarah Zagorski, communications director for Louisiana Right to Life, which supports the measure, said in a statement that the use of these drugs \"for legitimate health care needs will still be available.\"\n\nLouisiana law currently bans all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThe state lawmakers' discussion of the abortion medication coincides with the Supreme Court's review of potentially limiting public access to mifepristone after it heard oral arguments about its availability in late March. This was the first abortion case before the court since the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago.\n\nLeaders of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have been vocal in their opposition to the mifepristone since it was first given FDA approval in 2000. They echoed objections in 2016 when the FDA relaxed rules for its use, saying it could be administered with fewer visits to a doctor, and they also objected earlier this year when the FDA announced it was allowing some retail pharmacies to distribute the drug.\n\nBishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia, chairman of the USCCB's Committee on Pro-Life Activities, issued a statement the day of oral arguments saying: \"With dangerous abortion drugs now making up the majority of abortions and increasing in use, we pray that the Supreme Court will restore the Food and Drug Administration's safeguards for the health of women and protect more preborn children.\"\n\nLouisiana lawmakers have until June 3 to give the amended legislation final approval before sending it to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry.", "source": {"uri": "thetablet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tablet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carol_zimmermann@thetablet.org", "name": "Carol Zimmermann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttmacher_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guttmacher Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

She specializes in gender issues and abortion rights, which she has been covering for seven years. Her work has also appeared in The Lily, Insider, Cosmopolitan, GEN by Medium, and Refinery29, among other outlets.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Louisiana House of Representatives passed a first-in-the-nation bill that would reclassify the two drugs used in medication abortions as \"controlled dangerous substances\" and could have far-reaching implications for pregnancy care. Even though the state has had a near-total abortion ban in place since the overturn of Roe v. Wade and most patients can't access abortion pills unless they travel out of state or order them online, conservative lawmakers want to go a step further in equating the drugs to opioids and depressants. The bill is just the latest push by anti-abortion advocates to curb the use of pills -- which are used in more than two-thirds of abortions in the U.S. -- with the Supreme Court expected to rule next month on whether to reinstate certain restrictions on mifepristone.\n\nDuring the hourlong debate on the measure, known as SB276, anti-abortion state house lawmakers claimed that the drugs are \"harmful to an unborn child\" and that the proposed restrictions wouldn't prevent doctors from prescribing the pills in other clinical situations outside of abortion care. Opponents begged their colleagues to reconsider, pointing out that health providers in Louisiana have voiced their opposition to the bill. While mifepristone is approved by the FDA exclusively for abortion, misoprostol is a stomach-ulcer medication that's used off-label for a wide range of gynecological care beyond terminating a pregnancy, including inducing labor, managing a miscarriage and postpartum hemorrhaging, and softening the cervix before a biopsy. \"This does not prevent anyone from getting the drug, but it significantly delays care for plenty of people -- probably for 99 percent of people who need it and who have nothing to do with wanting an abortion,\" Democratic State Representative Mandy Landry said during the debate. Her motions to amend the measure and to send it back to committee for more discussion both failed on Tuesday.\n\nPregnancy care in Louisiana -- which has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the nation -- has already been disrupted because physicians are afraid of running afoul of the abortion ban, according to a recent report. The procedure is outlawed in nearly all cases with exceptions for when a pregnancy is \"medically futile\" or the life of the pregnant person is in danger. The law also does not exempt rape and incest cases, and lawmakers recently rejecting adding these exceptions for children under 17. Providers who are found in violation face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines. Researchers found that, to avoid the impression of violating the state's ban, health providers are delaying care for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages as well as performing C-sections rather than abortions -- the standard of care -- in cases when the pregnancy is not viable.\n\nMandry believes the bill will further intimidate health-care providers. \"The ban's exceptions are construed extremely narrowly, meaning doctors are afraid to even use them,\" she tells the Cut. \"Now, with this bill, providers are worried about being investigated just for writing a prescription. They are nervous about overprescribing misoprostol and looking like they are giving it out for abortions just like they're nervous about doing abortions to save the life of the mother.\"\n\nSB276 was introduced by Republican state senator Thomas Pressly, whose sister was given misoprostol by her then-husband without her knowledge. According to Texas prosecutors, the man was attempting to induce an abortion without his wife's consent. The child was born premature and has experienced developmental delays; earlier this year, he pleaded guilty to charges of injury to a child and assault of a pregnant person and was sentenced to 180 days in jail.\n\nThe measure originally intended to establish the crime of \"coerced criminal abortion,\" creating penalties for someone who gives a pregnant person abortion pills without their consent. But after the bill unanimously passed the state senate, Pressly, working in partnership with the anti-abortion organization Louisiana Right to Life, included a last-minute amendment to add abortion pills to the state's Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law. Drugs that are considered controlled, dangerous substances include opioids, depressants, and medications that are highly addictive, like Xanax and Valium. Rescheduling mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs would require physicians to have a special license to prescribe the pills; to list their names, their patients' names, and the pharmacy dispensing the medication in a state database; and to store the drugs in specific secure rooms.\n\n\"Louisiana has been ground zero for abortion for a really long time, and it's not really surprising that this kind of stuff is gonna keep happening,\" Mandry says. \"This bill is sort of creating a pregnancy database because misoprostol is prescribed very regularly to induce labor. If you know anyone who has been induced, it's highly likely they took that. It's a bad situation.\"\n\nThe bill carves out an exception for pregnant people who obtain the pills for their own consumption, but anyone who is not a health-care provider and is found in possession of abortion pills without intending to take them would be criminalized. Violators could face up to ten years in prison.\n\n\"Imagine you're a person who's 14 weeks pregnant and you're starting to miscarry. Your physician says, 'Well, I can prescribe you this medication, misoprostol, that will help you expel this miscarriage,'\" says Kirsten Moore, director of the EMAA Project, which seeks to expand access to medication abortion. \"Now you can't, as a patient, ask your partner or your mother or friends to go get the prescription filled for misoprostol. Instead, you're gonna have to jump through these extra hoops to show that you are in fact the person getting the medication.\"\n\nMore than 240 doctors in Louisiana oppose the measure and wrote a letter to Pressly saying that reclassifying abortion pills will create \"the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation.\" The Louisiana Society of Addiction Medicine also submitted a letter in opposition to the bill, referring to it as \"legislative overreach\" and saying it \"goes against the spirit of the drug scheduling system.\"\n\nThere's simply no scientific basis for reclassifying mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs, according to Moore. The pills have been on the market for more than two decades and have an excellent safety record (taking them is less risky than taking Viagra or Tylenol). \"Drugs are put in that Schedule IV category because they are shown to be addictive and they can be diverted to nefarious purposes,\" Moore says. \"But neither mifepristone or misoprostol are addictive, period. Putting these pills under lock and key again is just the wrong solution for what we know to be a pretty isolated incident of bad behavior.\"\n\nSB276 will also add to the climate of fear facing abortion seekers in Louisiana, says Tyler Barbarin, director of grants and development at the Louisiana Abortion Fund. The group, which offers financial and practical support to patients seeking an abortion outside the state, already hears confusion and distress among callers who aren't sure what they are legally allowed to do. \"There's the chilling effect every time a piece of legislation passes or even is threatened to pass. People are scared for their lives; they're scared to be criminalized,\" she says. \"It's not going to lend itself to people's well-being. You can't destroy people's ability to care for one another and then expect them to still thrive.\"\n\nThe measure, which was approved by a vote of 64-29, now goes back to the state senate for another vote, where it's expected to pass. Republican governor Jeff Landry, who opposes abortion rights, will likely sign the measure into law, and it could go into effect as early as October.\n\nIn a statement, Vice-President Kamala Harris condemned the legislation. \"Absolutely unconscionable. The Louisiana House just passed a bill that would criminalize the possession of medication abortion, with penalties of up to several years of jail time,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this,\" Harris said. Trump has bragged about being \"able to kill\" Roe and has said that it should be up to the states to determine abortion bans.\n\nSB276 could also have an impact outside of Louisiana. Experts expect to see similar bills crop up across the country, as the anti-abortion movement is deeply invested in cutting access to medication abortion, which now makes up more than 60 percent of clinician-provided terminations in the U.S. A recent #WeCount survey also found that about 8,000 patients a month are obtaining abortion pills through telehealth in states with abortion bans. \"It's not an accident, and it won't be an isolated incident, right?\" Moore says of the Louisiana bill, pointing at the current Supreme Court mifepristone case. \"If Louisiana does this, we can expect a number of other states to follow suit really quickly.\"\n\nThe Cut offers an online tool you can use to search by Zip Code for professional providers, including clinics, hospitals, and independent OB/GYNs, as well as for abortion funds, transportation options, and information for remote resources like receiving the abortion pill by mail.

It will now be sent back to the Senate for concurrence, and then on to the desk of Gov. Jeff Landry (R).\n\nIf it is signed into law as expected, Louisiana will become the first state in the country to consider the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol in the same category as narcotics and depressants, making their possession without a valid prescription a crime punishable by fines of up to $5,000 and years-long jail terms.\n\nThe bill allows Louisiana doctors to prescribe the drug. It also includes an exemption for pregnant women who obtain the abortion drugs for their own consumption. Vice President Kamala Harris was among those who expressed horror at its passage in the House, tweeting on Tuesday night that it was \"absolutely unconscionable.\"\n\n\"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this,\" she added.\n\nAbortion is already banned in Louisiana under most circumstances except to save the life of the mother or because the pregnancy is \"medically futile.\" There are no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nState Sen. Thomas Pressly (R) is responsible for the bill's introduction. The proposed legislation began as a means of making a crime out of \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud\" -- in other words, using the drugs to induce an abortion without the consent of the pregnant person.\n\nThe lawmaker has explained that the issue had had a personal impact on him and his loved ones. Pressly's sister, Catherine Herring, consumed abortion pills without her knowledge when she was given them by her estranged husband. Mason Herring pleaded guilty to charges of injury to a child and assault of a pregnant person earlier this year and was sentenced to 180 days behind bars.\n\nHe only attached the amendment to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol after the bill's unanimous passage in the Senate last month.\n\n\"Everyone was blindsided. This was attached to a very specific bill -- in response to the horrible thing that happened to his sister,\" state Rep. Mandie Landry (D) said Monday, according to The Washington Post. \"Then this different issue comes in. It was like the senator pulled a fast one. Changing the category of the medications is just malicious, and now every conservative state in the country will be copying it.\"\n\nThe bill's introduction was also met with fierce blowback from hundreds of Louisiana healthcare providers, who signed a letter to Pressly protesting its potential passage. The letter, obtained by CNN, stresses that mifepristone and misoprostol are \"widely prescribed and taken safely,\" that they are non-addictive, and that reclassifying them would create \"the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation.\"\n\nPressly told the network that the doctors he had consulted with about the legislation \"feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The latest example of this comes from Louisiana, where House lawmakers voted this week to make the abortion-inducing drugs mifepristone and misoprostol Schedule IV controlled substances.\n\nThat would make possession of these drugs a crime -- punishable by a mandatory minimum prison sentence of one year and up to five years incarceration and a fine of $5,000 -- unless they were \"obtained directly or pursuant to a valid prescription\" for something other than abortion.\n\nThe alleged rationale for this bill is especially insane. State Sen. Thomas Pressly (R-Shreveport) brought in his sister, Catherine Pressly Herring, to testify about how her husband secretly slipped her abortion drugs when she was pregnant. \"I share my story because no one should have abortion pills weaponized against them,\" Herring said at an April hearing.\n\nBut administering abortion pills is already illegal in Louisiana, where abortion is banned with few exceptions. The state wouldn't need a new law designating them a controlled substance in order to punish her husband's alleged deception.\n\nThere are also ways authorities could write a law to more narrowly target such behavior -- which is in fact what Sen. Pressley is trying to do with Senate Bill (SB) 276, the larger bill to which the controlled substance change is attached. SB 276 \"creates the crime of coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud to prohibit a third-party from knowingly using an abortion-inducing drug to cause, or attempt to cause, an abortion on an unsuspecting pregnant mother without her knowledge or consent,\" per the state legislature's website.\n\nWith or without this new crime, there is no reason the state needs to make abortion pills a Schedule IV controlled substance in order to target someone who secretly slips them into his pregnant wife's drink. But this is a common tactic used by lawmakers trying to grant the state new power: using an extreme and sympathetic example of wrongdoing to justify a wide-reaching change that will be used in matters way beyond that example.\n\nIn this case, the most likely target is doctors who prescribe mifepristone and misoprostol.\n\nBoth drugs have multiple uses beyond inducing abortions. In fact, misoprostol originally gained traction as an anti-ulcer drug. It also has a number of obstetric uses, including inducing labor and treatment after a miscarriage. And Mifepristone is prescribed to people with Cushing syndrome and uterine leiomyomas.\n\nPrescribing mifepristone or misoprostol for non-abortion reasons is still legal in Louisiana and other states where abortion is banned. But abortion foes worry some medical professionals may use this to covertly prescribe it for abortions.\n\nIf these drugs are controlled substances, doctors will have to have a special Drug Enforcement Administration license to prescribe them and the state will be able to track when they're prescribed, to whom, and at what pharmacy these prescriptions are filled.\n\n\"Louisiana law typically categorizes medications, such as opioids, as Category IV drugs because they are addictive and thus have a high potential for abuse,\" notes University of California, Davis School of Law professor Mary Ziegler at MSNBC:\n\nTo prescribe such drugs, physicians in the state need a special license, and the state tracks the patient, physician and pharmacy involved in each prescription. Therein lies one of the primary functions of the law: The state has had a hard time enforcing its abortion ban in part because it is hard to identify when and how pills change hands. At least when a prescription originates in state, this bill might give Louisiana prosecutors an extra edge in identifying people to prosecute.\n\nThe bill explicitly exempts pregnant women who have misoprostol or mifepristone for their own use from prosecution -- another example of the weird paternalism involved in anti-abortion laws. I'm certainly glad most states don't want to criminalize women for attempting or having abortions, but it's also somewhat crazy to act like the woman here is not culpable for her actions but someone who helped her get abortion pills is.\n\nWhile the law might not result in sending women to prison over abortion drugs, it could be bad for the health of women with miscarriages and other obstetric issues for which misoprostol and mifepristone are prescribed, as well as for people with ulcers and Cushing's disease.\n\nDoctors are likely to be leery of prescribing these medications for people who need them, much in the same way that crackdowns on pain pills and ADHD medications have harmed people who legitimately need these medicines for health conditions.\n\nIt defines the crime of coerced abortion by means of fraud as \"a person knowingly and intentionally engages in the use or attempted use of an abortion-inducing drug on a pregnant woman, without her knowledge or consent, to cause an abortion,\" and prescribed a punishment of five to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $75,000 if the woman was less than three months pregnant and 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000 if the pregnancy was further along than three months.\n\nIt also amends the state's prohibition on \"criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs\" to include not just causing an abortion by \"delivering, dispensing, distributing, or providing a pregnant woman with an abortion-inducing drug\" but also with attempting to cause an abortion by these means.\n\nSB 276 passed the House, with the amendment, on Tuesday, by a vote of 64-29. This version contains an amendment declaring \"any material, compound, mixture, or preparation containing any detectable quantity of mifepristone or misoprostol\" to be a Schedule IV controlled substance in Louisiana.\n\nThe measure now goes back to the Senate for another vote.\n\n* Florida is micromanaging what massage therapists can wear in the name of \"cracking down on human trafficking.\" Under a new law signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis last week, their clothing must be \"fully opaque and made of non-translucent material.\" The law also stipulates that window coverings at massage businesses must allow in 35 percent of light. This is the kind of law that will do naught for \"human trafficking\" or labor exploitation, of course. But it does give authorities more pretense to investigate, sanction, and shut down massage businesses of the sort disfavored in many communities.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_nolan_brown@reason.com", "name": "Elizabeth Nolan Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mandatory sentencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cushing's syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterine_fibroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterine fibroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2024/05/zumaamericasfortyone414379-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Criminalizing the possession of mifepristone and misoprostol - used to induce abortions for anyone without a prescription.\"\n\nJackson did manage to interview the bill's primary sponsor, State Sen. Thomas Pressly, where she recalled \"his sister was given an abortion drug while pregnant without her consent.\"\n\nHowever, Jackson left out the details. Catherine Herring, was six to eight weeks pregnant with her daughter when she began to suspect that her husband, Mason, was spiking her water with abortion pills. In Louisiana, mifepristone and misoprostol can be easily obtained through the mail or picked up out of state. Herring installed cameras in her home which revealed that she was taking abortion pills against her consent. In February of this year, Mason Herring pleaded guilty to injuring a child and the assault of a pregnant woman. He was sentenced to six months in jail.\n\nPressly filed Senate Bill 276 to criminalize the possession of abortion drugs without a prescription. He stated, \"My goal is certainly not to prevent women from getting the access to these pills when they need them. It is to simply say when you're a bad actor in possession of these pills that you should be held accountable.\"\n\nThe bill also makes it a crime to slip abortion pills to a pregnant woman without her given consent. With a prescription, individuals will be able to use these drugs. The purpose of this bill is to raise awareness on how dangerous these pills can be to your health if not taken with a doctor's permission and guidance.\n\nHowever, that didn't stop Jackson from fear-mongering. She cited doctors in Louisiana who believe that this bill will \"create confusion and misinformation\" since the drugs can also be used after a miscarriage or to induce labor.\n\nBut as Pressly himself noted, he isn't banning the drugs. An individual will just need to obtain a prescription of it from their doctor.\n\nThe transcript is below.

If Louisiana is successful, it could provide a blueprint for other state legislatures seeking to restrict abortions.\n\nThe state Senate passed a version of the bill last month. It was amended in the House to include language labeling the medications as Schedule IV drugs and now must go back to the Senate before it goes to Gov. Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign the bill.\n\nThe measure also has the support of Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. Both Landry and Murrill are Republicans.\n\nLouisiana state law already prohibits most abortions except in life-threatening situations, but the two drugs are still prescribed for other purposes in the state, including for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage or ulcers.\n\nOriginally, the bill, Senate Bill 276, would penalize individuals who attempt to give a pregnant woman the drugs without her consent. But the Louisiana House amended the bill Tuesday to make possession of these drugs without a prescription subject to a penalty of five to 10 years of jail time and/or a fine of $10,000 to $75,000.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration typically determine which substances are classified as controlled substances because of their likelihood to be abused, how addictive they are and if they have any medical use.\n\nThe bill would list mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs. Schedule IV drugs include substances with a medical use that have a low likelihood to be abused but whose use may cause a physical or psychological dependence. The category includes drugs like diazepam, sold under the brand name Valium and used to treat anxiety or seizures, and eszopiclone, sold under the name Lunesta and used to treat insomnia.\n\nStates can also schedule drugs, and in some cases will implement tougher regulations for some drugs than at the federal level. This also enables the state to track which providers are prescribing the drugs and which patients are receiving them through what are known as prescription drug monitoring programs.\n\nProponents of the legislation, like SBA Pro-Life America Southern Regional Director Caitlin Connors, said the reclassification of the two drugs should be \"uncontroversial.\"\n\n\"Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons -- like miscarriage care -- but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\" she said.\n\nThe Louisiana Society of Addiction Medicine opposes the bill and has urged the legislature to find a different pathway to punish anyone who uses the drugs on another individual without their consent.\n\nThe organization's president said its board, which is composed of physicians who support and oppose abortion rights, believes the bill would not prevent black market access of the drug and could result in more deaths of postpartum women.\n\nThe group also said the scheduling framework is intended to regulate drugs associated with substance use, and this model would have unintended effects like decreasing the likelihood the drugs are prescribed for legitimate purposes.\n\nPolitical pushback\n\nThe prospect of a new type of restriction on medication abortion occurs as advocates are awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on mifepristone regulations. The two fights have fired up Democrats campaigning on the issue of reproductive rights.\n\n\"If Louisiana is successful in passing this dangerous bill into law, other Republican-led states will follow,\" said Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee National Press Secretary Sam Paisley. \"The only way to stop this onslaught of Republican attacks in Louisiana and across the country is by making a concerted effort to build Democratic power in state legislatures.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign criticized the legislation Wednesday, lining up Louisianans to discuss its impact. Democrats are pushing reproductive health as their central campaign issue.\n\nMitch Landrieu, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign co-chair, said that \"monitoring these pregnancies is going to have a huge chilling effect on women getting the kind of care that they need to manage and handle their pregnancies.\" He said the bill includes language related to racketeering charges, which could result in a friend or family member facing criminal penalties for attempting to help a woman access the medications.\n\nEllie Schilling, an adjunct professor at Tulane Law School and reproductive health law expert, called the bill language \"wildly inappropriate in terms of what these drugs actually do and are used for.\"\n\n\"This legislation would lead to the government monitoring both pregnant women and those who prescribe these medications. The state of Louisiana would effectively be creating a database of prescriptions for every woman who is prescribed mifepristone and misoprostol, regardless of the reason,\" she said during a Biden campaign call Wednesday.\n\nKaitlyn Joshua, a woman from Baton Rouge, spoke about her experience being turned away for treatment from two emergency rooms while having a miscarriage in 2022, following the Dobbs decision.\n\n\"Ultimately, it took me weeks to pass my pregnancy at home and I was absolutely terrified,\" said Joshua on the call. \"What I experienced can happen in all 50 states across this country if Trump returns to the White House.\"\n\nLouisiana State Sen. Thomas Pressly, the bill's sponsor, accused Vice President Kamala Harris of \"blatantly lying about my bill\" in response to her tweet about it. Pressly said he was inspired to introduce the bill after his sister was tricked into ingesting the drugs.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not weighed in on the Louisiana legislation and has largely stayed away from making sweeping policy commitments regarding abortion on the campaign trail.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump stated he was considering changes to contraception access before walking back the statement.\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

Medical professionals have spoken out against the measure, saying the medications have critical uses outside of abortion care, including aiding in labor and delivery, miscarriage treatment, and the prevention of gastrointestinal ulcers.\n\nLouisiana bans all abortions regardless of method except to save a patient's life or when pregnancy is \"medically futile\" -- meaning that the fetus has a fatal abnormality. State lawmakers recently rejected proposed exceptions for rape and incest victims under 17 who become pregnant.\n\nLouisiana S.B. 276 codifies \"criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drug,\" and prohibits individuals from possessing either of the two pills without a valid prescription or outside a professional practice. While the bill exempts pregnant women from prosecution, it imposes the threat of serious fines and prison time for offenders. The legislation passed the state House of Representatives 64-29 after over an hour of debate.\n\nAnyone who commits the crime of \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud\" under the statute \"shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than five nor more than ten years, fined not less than ten thousand nor more than seventy-five thousand dollars, or both.\" Should the pregnant person be more than three months pregnant at the time of the abortion, the offender would be subject to 10 to 20 years in prison and a $50,000 to $100,000 fine.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Louisiana Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, who notably forgot the name of one of the drugs while introducing the legislation.\n\nEarlier this month, over 200 OB-GYN physicians sent an open letter to Pressly urging him to withdraw the bill and arguing that mifepristone and misoprostol do not belong on a list of controlled substances any more than insulin, Viagra, or Ozempic do. The legislation at issue would classify the drugs in the same category as Xanax and Valium, stimulants, sleep aids, and muscle relaxants.\n\nLikewise, the Louisiana Society of Addiction Medicine sent a letter to the Louisiana House Speaker Phillip DeVillier before the vote warning that adding mifepristone and misoprostol to the state's controlled dangerous substances list could increase \"deaths in post-partum women ... where maternal mortality rates are already notoriously high.\"\n\nSmita Prasad, the president of the society, said in the letter that the group does not condone the \"weaponizing of medication,\" and relayed that she herself took misoprostol to prevent life-threatening hemorrhaging after the birth of her daughter.\n\nThe bill now heads back to the state Senate, where it is expected to be quickly approved, then to Gov. Jeff Landry for signing into law.\n\nLouisiana's first-of-its-kind legislation sparked immediate reaction from leaders across the country.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey posted on X, formerly Twitter:\n\nPressly responded immediately to Harris's post, accusing the vice president of \"blatantly lying\" and urging her to \"do better.\"\n\nPressly has said that the issue of abortion pills is highly personal to him because of the experience of his sister, Catherine Herring. Herring's estranged husband pleaded guilty slipping abortion medication into her drinks while she was pregnant with their third child and was sentenced to 180 days in jail for his crime.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in March over mifepristone. A ruling is expected in that case before the close of the Court's term this summer. The litigation involves a group of anti-abortion doctors who claim the justices should uphold a lower court's ruling directing the Federal Food and Drug Administration to revoke its 20-year-old approval of the drug because they have an objection to treating patients who have taken the drug.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peptic ulcer disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sildenafil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstetrics and gynaecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diazepam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stimulant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gottheimer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Gottheimer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/HarrisPressley.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Jeff Landry, will be a template for conservative states trying to end the procedure.\n\nThe bill passed 64-29 after more than an hour of debate.\n\nIf S.B. 276 is signed into law as expected by Landry, Louisiana would become the first state in the country to include mifepristone and misoprostol in the same category as opioids, depressants and other drugs that can be highly addictive.\n\nThe bill includes the threat of incarceration and fines for an individual possessing the pills without a valid prescription or outside of professional practice. It exempts pregnant women from prosecution.\n\nLouisiana already bans both medication and surgical abortions except to save a patient's life or because a pregnancy is \"medically futile.\" Lawmakers recently turned down proposed exceptions for teenagers under 17 who become pregnant through rape or incest.\n\nThe language about controlled dangerous substances was added to a measure initially focused on criminalizing an abortion if someone gives a pregnant woman the pills without her consent. The amendment ignited significant concern and pushback from doctors in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday, the Louisiana Society of Addiction Medicine sent a letter to House Speaker Phillip DeVillier that called the bill \"legislative overreach.\" The group said it \"goes against the spirit of the drug scheduling system, which is designed to classify substances based upon their danger, potential for misuse and medical benefit.\"\n\nA separate letter sent this month to the bill's sponsor by more than 240 OB/GYN physicians noted misoprostol's other critical uses, including to prevent gastrointestinal ulcers, to aid in labor and delivery, and to stop bleeding after a miscarriage. The doctors said the bill could needlessly delay care for such patients as well as increase the fears of pharmacists already questioning their risk in filling prescriptions.\n\n\"Given its historically poor maternal health outcomes, Louisiana should prioritize safe and evidence-base care for pregnant women,\" they urged.\n\nRep. Aimee Adatto Freeman, D-New Orleans, drove home that point Tuesday. \"We have the worst maternal outcomes in the nation. ... Let me tell you something, 50th in maternal outcomes is not pro-life,\" she angrily told her colleagues.\n\nAttempts to curtail medication abortions - which now constitute more than half of all abortions in the United States - are part of legislative agendas not just in deep-red Louisiana but in many Republican-controlled statehouses.\n\nIn Texas, the proposed \"Wrongful Death Protection Act\" would have held liable those who manufacture, market, mail, distribute, transport, deliver, provide or possess mifepristone with the intent of facilitating unlawful abortions. It was debated but not passed last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Indiana, a measure that would have barred the prescription or possession of abortion-inducing drugs also was proposed this year but didn't make it out of committee.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill this spring to make distributing abortion pills felony drug trafficking punishable by a $100,000 fine, 10 years in prison or both. It awaits action in the Senate.\n\n\"They know the positions they're taking are extreme and unpopular,\" Dana Sussman, senior vice president of the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice, said of Republican lawmakers there.\n\nIn Nebraska, which passed a 12-week abortion ban last year, a mother was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty to giving her teenage daughter abortion medication after at least 20 weeks gestation.\n\n\"One of the biggest problems with criminalization is everyone is afraid,\" said Shelley Mann, Omaha-based executive director of Nebraska Abortion Resources, a nonprofit fund. Mann said the case there had a chilling effect, making women afraid to take abortion pills or otherwise pursue abortion in state.\n\nSussman said it's not clear how Louisiana will enforce the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"How will prosecutors determine whether this is for one's own use or not? Will they perform pregnancy tests? ... It's creating this idea of a surveillance state for pregnancy that feels quite dystopian,\" she said.\n\nBut Sussman still expects the law to have an immediate chilling effect in Louisiana.\n\nMedication abortion \"has allowed people to maintain some bodily autonomy even in banned states, and that's why [abortion opponents are] going after this,\" she said. They also have tried to restrict abortion medication access via local travel bans and court cases.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case brought against the Food and Drug Administration by a group of antiabortion doctors seeking to limit access to mifepristone.\n\nLouisiana has long been at the forefront with antiabortion legislation. Its latest effort started with the proposal by Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, whose former brother-in-law repeatedly tried to give the lawmaker's sister an abortion pill without her knowledge when she was pregnant with a third child. She was \"poisoned,\" Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, said while presenting the measure Tuesday.\n\n\"Something that is to that level of being able to kill an unborn child, it's always wise for it to be used under the care of a physician,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressly's bill was intended to create a crime of \"coerced criminal abortion,\" but after S.B. 276 passed unanimously in the Senate last month, he attached the amendment to include mifepristone and misoprostol under the state's Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law.\n\nOn both, Pressly worked in partnership with Louisiana Right to Life.\n\n\"Everyone was blindsided. This was attached to a very specific bill - in response to the horrible thing that happened to his sister,\" Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, noted Monday. \"Then this different issue comes in. It was like the senator pulled a fast one. Changing the category of the medications is just malicious, and now every conservative state in the country will be copying it.\"\n\nDemocrats tried repeatedly to delay or derail the amendment during the debate. Rep. Landry warned that it would most hurt rural communities with fewer physicians and pharmacies, stressing the many ways the two drugs are used for reasons other than abortion.\n\n\"The pills have not changed. The politics have changed,\" she said, adding, \"It's pretty terrible how this good bill was hijacked by outsiders who are not doctors.\"\n\nBut Rep. Debbie Villio (R-Baton Rouge) insisted physicians on both sides debated the measure in committee and accused Rep. Landry of \"fearmongering\" about the problems that will result from such a law.\n\nIn a statement earlier this month, Pressly said he added the amendment to \"control the rampant illegal distribution of abortion-inducing drugs.\"\n\n\"By placing these drugs on the controlled substance list, we will assist law enforcement in protecting vulnerable women and unborn babies,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department, suggested lawmakers would be ignoring the medicine and science. Misoprostol \"is not an addictive drug used to get high,\" she said in an interview. \"It has a lot of important uses - given to prevent women from bleeding out after childbirth. ... To me, this is from a national conservative playbook. And this could be the test case that can be picked up by other states.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\"

The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added after it passed out of the Senate.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIn a medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.\n\nThe amended bill would make it a felony - punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 - for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription.\n\nThe legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs.\n\nIn Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000.\n\n\"Absolutely unconscionable,\" Vice President Kamala Harris wrote on X in response to the bill's House passage Tuesday night, adding, \"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this.\"\n\nThe anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the bill's passage.\n\n\"Adding abortion drugs to the controlled substance list should be uncontroversial. Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons - like miscarriage care - but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\" Caitlin Connors, the group's southern regional director, said in a news release.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification.\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \"neither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\"\n\nThe letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \"the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\" and that they are \"widely prescribed and taken safely.\"\n\nPressly rebutted the letter's claims in a response he shared with CNN last week: \"If enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\"\n\n\"The doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\" he continued.\n\nIf the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed out of the House, it will next head to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry.

Should the Senate follow suit, Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican and a vocal opponent of abortion, is likely to sign the legislation into law.\n\nThe measure -- which would put abortion pills in the same category as Xanax, Ambien and Valium -- contradicts the way the federal government classifies mifepristone and misoprostol. The federal Food and Drug Administration does not consider abortion pills to be drugs with the potential for dependence or abuse, and decades of medical studies have found both to be overwhelmingly safe.\n\nUnder the legislation, possession of mifepristone or misoprostol without a prescription in Louisiana could be punishable with thousands of dollars in fines and up to five years in jail. Pregnant women would be exempt from those penalties; most abortion bans and restrictions do not punish pregnant women because most voters oppose doing so.\n\n\"These drugs are increasingly being shipped from outside our state and country to women and girls in our state,\" Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican, said in a statement on social media. \"This legislation does NOT prohibit these drugs from being prescribed and dispensed in Louisiana for legal and legitimate reasons.\"\n\nLouisiana already bans most abortions, except when women's lives or health are in danger or fetuses have some fatal conditions. As a result, abortion rights advocates and legal scholars said that in practice, the measure might not prevent many abortions among Louisiana women. Since the state imposed its strict abortion ban after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many patients have traveled to states where abortion is legal or have obtained pills under shield laws from doctors or nurses in other states who prescribe and mail the medications to Louisiana.

Wade in 2022. But the legislation the House passed Tuesday would make possession of the medications without a valid prescription punishable by up to five years in prison -- even though they have uses beyond inducing abortion.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind proposal, which passed 64-29, now goes to the state's Republican-controlled Senate. If it passes there, it will move on to Gov. Jeff Landry (R), who is expected to sign it.\n\nThe drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are the most common method of terminating pregnancy. In 2023, the Guttmacher Institute found the medications accounted for 63% of all abortions in the United States -- up 10% from 2020. Since its FDA approval in 2000, mifepristone -- the first of the two drugs taken to terminate a pregnancy -- has been used more than 5 million times, with fewer than 0.5% of users experiencing \"serious adverse reactions.\"\n\nDemocrats blasted the bill's progress Tuesday.\n\n\"Louisiana Republicans already have a dangerous total abortion ban on the books that could threaten IVF access, and now they're threatening jail time for simply possessing medication abortion pills,\" Sam Paisley, press secretary for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement, calling the idea \"outrageous.\"\n\nVoters should anticipate a Louisiana law like this being influential in other red states.\n\n\"If Louisiana is successful in passing this dangerous bill into law, other Republican-led states will follow,\" she warned.\n\nThe House's passage of the bill is \"absolutely unconscionable,\" Vice President Kamala Harris posted on social media.\n\nDespite the drug's widespread use, the bill's author, Sen. Thomas Pressly (R), cited an exceptional situation in his reasoning for bringing it to the floor. Speaking on Pressly's behalf at Tuesday's vote, state Rep. Julie Emerson (R) recounted how Pressly's niece \"was poisoned by her former husband\" when he \"crushed up the abortion inducing drug misoprostol and put it in her water with the intent of aborting their unborn child.\"\n\nEmerson continued: \"So what this bill is going to do is, it's going to make sure that our laws can hold accountable those individuals who are using deception to harm women and unborn children.\"\n\nCovertly drugging someone is already a punishable offense.\n\nDemocrat state Rep. Mandie Landry (no relation to Gov. Landry) argued against the bill Tuesday, saying the sudden need to treat the drugs as dangerous substances is absurd.\n\n\"These prescriptions have been used for a really long time, and they're used probably thousands of times per day in this country. Nothing about this has changed, but the politics of this has changed,\" she said ahead of the vote.\n\nFurthermore, she noted, the drugs have numerous other medical uses that have nothing to do with abortion.\n\n\"This is used for ulcers, miscarriage. It's to induce labor. It's postpartum hemorrhaging. If you get an IUD, it might help with that,\" she listed.\n\nClassifying drugs under the state's Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law also requires them to be addictive, she noted -- something mifepristone and misoprostol are certainly not.\n\n\"Nothing has changed to make these drugs addictive,\" she said. \"You cannot be addicted to misoprostol unless you get pregnant once a month, I guess.\"\n\nThe Louisiana bill comes as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs a case that could severely scale back access to mifepristone. However, a majority of justices appeared skeptical of the lawsuit's merits when they heard the case in March. The court is expected to release its ruling as early as June.", "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lydia_o_connor@sg.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Lydia O'Connor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Thomas Pressly's Senate Bill 276 late Tuesday on a 64-29 vote.\n\nLouisiana's Senate is expected to agree to changes made to the bill that would add the medications to the list and send it to Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to be signed into law. Abortion is already illegal in Louisiana, as are the use of the pills to induce an abortion.\n\nPressly's bill was originally written to add \"coerced abortion by means of fraud\" as a crime after his sister Catherine Pressly Herring's husband tried to secretly abort their baby by spiking her drinks with the abortion-inducing pills.\n\nThe original legislation had widespread bipartisan support when it cleared the Senate, but the bill became controversial after Pressly added an amendment in a House committee hearing to classify the abortion pills as controlled dangerous substances at the urging of the powerful Louisiana Right to Life lobby.\n\nMisoprostol and mifepristone could still be used to treat other conditions, but as controlled dangerous substances they would have to be prescribed by a doctor.\n\nThe bill carries criminal prison penalties for anyone in possession of misoprostol or mifepristone without a valid prescription, though there is an exception for pregnant women.\n\nPressly told USA Today Network he doesn't believe his bill will present a barrier to accessing the medication \"for legitimate medical purposes other than abortion.\"\n\nBut more than 200 doctors and medical students signed a letter sent to Pressly and other lawmakers and media that said the bill would create \"fear and confusion among patients, doctors and pharmacists, which delays care and worsens outcomes\" if it becomes law.\n\nThat was the primary concern expressed by the minority of lawmakers who voted against the bill.\n\n\"You are hampering you wife's or daughter's ability to get these drugs because people are going to be hesitant to prescribe these drugs,\" Democratic New Orleans Rep. Aimee Freeman said during the debate.\n\nRepublican Lafayette Rep. Julie Emerson, who presented Pressly's bill in the House, acknowledged the controversy created by the legislation.\n\n\"I get it would probably be unanimous (in support of the bill) if that (amendment) wasn't on it, but if overused (the drugs) can be harmful and cause death,\" she said.\n\nThe legislation has triggered national attention, even drawing the ire of Vice President Kamala Harris, who posted on X: \"Absolutely unconscionable. The Louisiana House just passed a bill that would criminalize the possession of medication abortion, with penalties of up to several years of jail time.

The amendment that would classify the drugs as Schedule IV substances was added after it passed out of the Senate.\n\nThe bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Thomas Pressly, said he proposed the legislation after his sister was given misoprostol against her will. Abortion is already banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIn a medication abortion, mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. A second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades.\n\nThe amended bill would make it a felony - punishable with up to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000 - for anyone found in possession of the drugs without a valid prescription.\n\nThe legislation includes an exemption for pregnant women in possession of mifepristone and misoprostol for their own consumption. Doctors in the state would still be able to prescribe the drugs.\n\nIn Louisiana, the distribution or possession with intent to distribute Schedule IV drugs carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $15,000.\n\nCNN has previously reported that the bill sparked outcry from a group of nearly 270 Louisiana physicians, health care providers and medical students, who signed a letter to Pressly expressing concerns over the reclassification.\n\nThe letter, obtained by CNN, says in part, \"neither mifepristone nor misoprostol have been shown to have any potential for abuse, dependence, public health risk, nor high rates of adverse side effects.\"\n\nThe letter continues that placing the drugs under Schedule IV would create \"the false perception that these are dangerous drugs that require additional regulation\" and that they are \"widely prescribed and taken safely.\"\n\nPressly rebutted the letter's claims in a response he shared with CNN last week: \"If enacted, this legislation would not prohibit misoprostol or even mifepristone from being prescribed or dispensed for legitimate reasons.\"\n\n\"The doctors I have consulted with feel this provision will not harm healthcare for women,\" he continued.\n\nIf the state Senate accepts the amended bill passed out of the House, it will next head to the desk of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. If Landry were to sign the bill into law, Louisiana would become the only state to classify the drugs as controlled dangerous substances.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shawn_nottingham@cnn.com", "name": "Shawn Nottingham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "john_bonifield@cnn.com", "name": "John Bonifield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dianne_gallagher@cnn.com", "name": "Dianne Gallagher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peptic ulcer disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progesterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1253630650-20240522002910791.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Thomas Pressly. In its original Senate version, the bill would make it a crime to intentionally give an abortion-inducing drug to a pregnant woman without her consent, something he said happened to his sister, Catherine Herring, in another state.\n\nThe amended bill now proceeds to the state Senate.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the measure was \"Absolutely unconscionable.\"\n\n\"The Louisiana House just passed a bill that would criminalize the possession of medication abortion, with penalties of up to several years of jail time,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this,\" Harris added.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign has sought to tie restrictions on abortion to the former president, the presumptive Republican nominee. But Trump issued a statement in April arguing abortion should be left to individual states to legislate and declined to back federal restrictions sought by pro-life activists.\n\nPressly replied to Harris on X, stating \"what's unconscionable is blatantly lying about my bill.\"\n\n\"Leaving out the part about 'not having a valid prescription' & our efforts to protect expectant mothers from being slipped abortion meds by diabolical spouses, that's kind of a big omission,\" he wrote. \"Do better.\"\n\nThe legislation would classify mifepristone and misoprostol -- the combination of drugs used in a chemical or medication abortion -- as controlled dangerous substances, a category also including medications that can be abused including narcotics. However, the bill states someone who possesses the drugs \"for her own consumption\" would be exempt from prosecution.\n\nThe same pill combination also has been prescribed to women who experience early pregnancy miscarriage to expel any fetal remains and residual pregnancy tissue from the womb. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists updated its protocols to recommend a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol as more effective than misoprostol alone for early miscarriage care based on research published since 2018.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has argued the drugs pose statistically little risk to the mother in the early weeks of pregnancy. But critics have alleged regulations on the drug were improperly reduced in a lawsuit currently under consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that more than half of the abortions performed in the U.S. -- or 53% -- are carried out with medication rather than surgical procedures.\n\nLouisiana prohibits abortion unless a woman's life is at risk or a pregnancy deemed \"medically futile.\"\n\nOSV News has reached out to the Louisiana Catholic Conference and is awaiting comment.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that all human life is sacred from conception to natural death, opposing direct abortion as an act of violence that takes the life of the unborn child.\n\nAfter the Dobbs decision, Church officials in the United States have reiterated the Church's concern for both mother and child, and called to strengthen available support for those living in poverty or other causes that can push women toward having an abortion.", "source": {"uri": "thedialog.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dialog"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_scanlon@thedialog.org", "name": "Kate Scanlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

But now the possession itself without a prescription could get an individual up to five years in prison, according to NBC News. The bill passed the House on Tuesday, but still needs to go to the state Senate and then to the governor's desk.\n\nThe bill puts the abortion medication mifepristone and misoprostol under a Schedule IV classification of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law. Other Schedule IV drugs include Xanax, and Valium, along with sleep aids and stimulants for ADHD.\n\nThe bill also punishes those who commit \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud,\" which targets those who slip abortion pills into an unknowing person's food or drink in order to cause, or attempt to cause, an abortion. People who commit this crime could face up to 10 years in prison, or up to 20 years if the pregnant person was three or more months into a pregnancy.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Thomas Pressly said the matter of coerced criminal abortion is important to him because the estranged husband of his sister was accused of slipping abortion drugs into her drinks when she was pregnant with the couple's third child.

This decision aligns with Louisiana's stringent stance on abortion, which is already illegal in the state except under very limited circumstances. The legislation, now awaiting further approval from the Senate and potentially the governor, has sparked debate between anti-abortion groups, medical professionals, and reproductive rights advocates.\n\nThe bill's passage in the state's GOP-controlled House of Representatives by a 64-29 vote underscores the political divide on the issue. If enacted, the law would impose penalties of up to five years in prison for unauthorized possession of these medications, though pregnant individuals using the drugs for self-administration would not be prosecuted, the outlet reported.\n\nMedical professionals are raising concerns about the broader implications of this bill. They pointed out that mifepristone and misoprostol have essential uses beyond abortion, such as in labor induction, miscarriage management, and the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers, NBC News stated. Dr. Jennifer Avegno, along with over 250 other doctors, has voiced opposition to the bill, arguing that it misrepresents the safety of these medications and could hinder other critical medical treatments.

Thomas Pressly was influenced by a personal incident involving his sister, whose estranged husband was convicted of secretly administering abortion medication, NBC News reported.

While both are commonly used to induce abortion -- which is almost entirely outlawed in Louisiana -- misoprostol is also used for other purposes, such as miscarriage care and to prevent stomach ulcers in certain patients.\n\nThose with a prescription would still be able to legally obtain and possess the drugs. But Democrats voiced concerns that the new law could result in delays in treatment for women suffering complications from miscarriages in a state with one of the highest maternal mortality rates.\n\n\"These medications touch on maternal health, which, as we've all discussed for several years now, is really bad in Louisiana,\" Democrat state Rep. Mandie Landry said prior to the vote.\n\nThe representative said she had been inundated by calls and emails from doctors who feared negative outcomes for their patients.\n\nBut Republican state Rep. Julie Emerson said the bill would only prevent those with the intent to coerce women into having an abortion from obtaining the drug.\n\n\"What this bill is going to do is it's going to make sure that our laws can hold accountable those individuals who are using deception to harm women and unborn children,\" Ms. Emerson said, noting that the matter was personal to the bill's sponsor, state Sen. Thomas Pressly.\n\nMr. Pressly's sister, Catherine Herring, has openly shared her story of being unknowingly slipped an abortion pill by her then-husband in an attempt to kill their unborn child.\n\n\"He attempted to poison her drink seven times,\" Ms. Emerson said. \"Thankfully, with the help of the abortion pill reversal regimens, Sen. Pressly's niece is alive today. But she was delivered 10 weeks early and attends therapy multiple times a week.\"\n\nMs. Herring's husband was sentenced to 180 days in county jail for his crimes.\n\nThe initial bill that originated in the Senate did not include the amendment to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol but created the crime of \"coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud.\"\n\nAbortion has already been almost completely banned in the state, except in cases that pose a threat to the mother's life or involve a fatal fetal anomaly.\n\n\"This first-in-the-nation bill poses a grave threat to Louisianans -- it's outrageous that state Republicans are considering imposing jail time for the possession of safe, FDA-approved abortion medication,\" DLCC Communications Director Abhi Rahman said in a statement.\n\nBut Caitlin Connors, southern regional director for Susan B.

(BRPROUD) - The Louisiana House has given the go-ahead to classify two drugs that could induce abortions as controlled substances. The two pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, are commonly used in reproductive health care and have gained popularity in states like Louisiana that have a near-total ban on abortions.\n\nThey can be used to end a pregnancy up to ten weeks of gestation. There are several other reasons why a woman may need the drugs such as cases of post-hemorrhage, miscarriages, inducing labor and more.\n\nAn amendment was added to SB276 that would change the classification of the two pills to Schedule IV. This would mean it is illegal for someone to knowingly possess the drugs and could face up to five years in prison. The bill carves out protections for pregnant women who have the drug for their own consumption.\n\nIt is already a crime in Louisiana to be given medication to induce an abortion and it is illegal to mail the drugs to someone in the state.\n\nIt could make it illegal for women who have them but are not planning to take them right away. Louisiana has banned all abortions except in the cases when the fetus is found to be \"medically futile\" or there is a risk to the mother's life.\n\nMoving the drugs into Schedule IV will also make it easier to track who is prescribing the drugs and the personal information of those who are getting the pills. This is done through the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. Doctors will need a DEA license to prescribe the drugs as well according to House debate.\n\nLegislators against the bill said their main concern about the amendments is that being in Schedule IV could cause major delays in getting the medication to women who need it. They said rural areas would be particularly impacted.\n\nThe bill started out as a personal story for state Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, who brought his sister to testify about her husband slipping the abortion-inducing drug into cups of water to force her to end her pregnancy.\n\nCatherine Pressly Herring was able to get emergency treatment after the first time drinking the spiked water and her daughter Josephine survived but now deals with health effects because of the ordeal.\n\n\"I share my story because no one should have abortion pills weaponized against them,\" Herring said in an April hearing. \"Josephine is alive today because I stopped drinking the drinks that the person whom I loved and trusted the most in the world gave to me in a wicked act of deception.\"\n\nThe amendment was added on in a House committee at the last minute and was put together by Louisiana's powerful anti-abortion group, Louisiana Right to Life.\n\nState Rep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, said she is frustrated with LA Right to Life pushing legislators on healthcare decisions. Freeman represents many of the major hospitals in New Orleans.\n\n\"50th in health outcomes is not pro-life,\" Freeman said.\n\nMore than 200 doctors penned a letter to Pressly against the amendment, saying the drugs have no signs of being a public health risk and are safe for miscarriage treatment. They said this amendment would make it harder for women to get medically safe treatments.\n\n\"I recognize that there are legitimate medical uses other than elective abortion for these drugs. Louisiana law is clear that if abortion-inducing drugs are used for purposes other than elective abortion, they are legal for use. The medical community is well-versed with using controlled substances in the course of their medical practice,\" Pressly said in a statement reported by The Hill.\n\nLouisiana is the first state to change the schedules of the two drugs, and other states will likely follow its lead.\n\nThe bill now heads back to the Senate to approve the amendments made by the House before it can be sent to the governor's desk for signature.", "source": {"uri": "brproud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BRPROUD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shannon_heckt@brproud.com", "name": "Shannon Heckt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gestation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Pharmacology", "wgt": 28}], "image": "https://www.brproud.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2024/03/AP24079580830279-e1711290177442.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision in the case by the end of June.\n\nThe regimen is currently federally approved to end pregnancies up to 11 weeks.\n\nMedication abortion is currently the most common form of abortion in the U.S., according to a study from the Guttmacher Institute.

They could face 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine from $50,000 to $100,000, according to the bill.\n\nThere is a substantially higher risk to the life of a pregnant mother if the pregnancy is more than three months along, according to the bill.\n\nViolators of the law can still be prosecuted even if the attempted abortion is unsuccessful, the bill said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combined oral contraceptive pill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttmacher_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guttmacher Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KuKlJRwPoVrKov8D4wH02w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/ea1b90059d8974ec749a7f24f8a132dd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

State Sen. Thomas Pressley of Shreveport said his brother-in-law had slipped an abortion-inducing drug into his sister's drink without her knowledge. The contamination prompted the woman to give birth to a child 10 weeks early. Mingling dangerous substances is already against the law, and the man was sentenced to jail for a half-year.\n\nFollowing the 64-29 vote Tuesday, the bill was sent back to the Senate for concurrence in a minor amendment. The bill would go into effect this fall.\n\nRep. Mandie Landry, on the House floor, sought to amend the bill to remove the drugs' addition to Louisiana's Schedule IV list of controlled substances, which also includes Xanax. Drugs that are often subject to abuse are listed by the state, though through Tuesday's debate few suggested that misoprostol and mifepristone are habit-forming.\n\nLandry also argued that, with tighter restrictions on the drugs, women needing them for a legitimate use might have trouble obtaining them if they lived miles or hours from a pharmacy that carries them. Misoprostol, for instance, can be used to induce labor in pregnant women, and treat ulcers.\n\nMost abortions are illegal in Louisiana, and have been since 2022, whether surgical or with the combination of misoprostol and mifepristone.\n\nThe names of patients who receive controlled drugs, and the doctors who prescribe them, are kept on lists at the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy.", "source": {"uri": "wbrz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBRZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandie_Landry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mandie Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_of_drugs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition of drugs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alprazolam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://dcer237tfveol.cloudfront.net/v2/JHLC0uW7-y1wuBn1STjpSQUhhuoPlLrpFLTGqeM1sVSPMrSKW23yDNIS7eCqHy4UjEJg4bAzSUr6ry1XaWkXAUf_1ECpcmQVS2fn2O5EeHiuJmNSMklKRbYv_hQsv8OqY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The two drugs are used to induce a medicated abortion.\n\nThe state House passed the bill by a vote of 64 yeas and 29 nays, and it now heads back to the state Senate for a concurring vote. It would then head to Gov. Jeff Landry's (R) desk, who is expected to sign it.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris posted on social media platform X responding to the vote, saying it's \"absolutely unconscionable.\"\n\n\"The Louisiana House just passed a bill that would criminalize the possession of medication abortion, with penalties of up to several years of jail time,\" she wrote. \"Let's be clear: Donald Trump did this.\"\n\nState Sen. Thomas Pressly (R), who sponsored the bill, posted in response to Harris' comment, saying it's unconscionable for her to lie about his legislation, which began after his sister was unknowingly given the medication.\n\n\"Leaving out the part about 'not having a valid prescription' & our efforts to protect expectant mothers from being slipped abortion meds by diabolical spouses, that's kind of a big omission. Do better,\" Pressly posted.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer (N.J.) said he was \"disgusted\" by the vote. He said he introduced legislation attempting to protect mifepristone and women's right to choose \"across the country, like we do here in NJ.\"\n\nThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) also released a statement following the vote, admonishing the Republicans who passed it.\n\n\"If Louisiana is successful in passing this dangerous bill into law, other Republican-led states will follow. The only way to stop this onslaught of Republican attacks in Louisiana and across the country is by making a concerted effort to build Democratic power in state legislatures,\" DLCC National Press Secretary Sam Paisely said in a statement.\n\nWhile the measure is unpopular with pro-choice Democrats, pro-life groups celebrated the vote. The Susan B.

It also enables states to track drugs and create a database of who's receiving them, along with making possession of the medication without a prescription a crime. Under the legislation, pregnant women are exempted from prosecution.\n\nThe two-drug regimen accounts for well over half of all abortions in the U.S., making it a target for opponents of abortion and a key avenue for access for those who support abortion rights. Mifepristone in particular, which was approved by the FDA in 2000, has been under fire in recent years. The Supreme Court is considering a case this term concerning the rules around the drug's use.\n\nThe medications are also used outside of abortions, for other care such as managing miscarriages. Ellie Schilling, an attorney in Louisiana who specializes in reproductive health law, told reporters in a Biden-Harris campaign press call Wednesday that the bill would make it \"incredibly difficult\" to use the drugs for medically necessary purposes, and would lead to the government monitoring pregnant women and those who prescribe the medication.\n\n\"The State of Louisiana would effectively be creating a database of prescriptions for every woman who is prescribed mifepristone and misoprostol, regardless of the reason, truly monitoring women and their pregnancies,\" Schilling said. \"That should be unimaginable in America.\"\n\nAlthough abortion is already banned in Louisiana in most circumstances, except when it's deemed necessary to prevent the risk of death for the mother or when the pregnancy is \"medically futile,\" the legislation could be a template for other states to take aim at the medication commonly used in early-stage pregnancies.\n\n\"Women in Louisiana are one step closer towards living in a world where they can be monitored and tracked and even sent to prison for just holding FDA-approved medications,\" said Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans and a Biden campaign co-chair. \"What's happening right here in Louisiana is just one example of this dystopian agenda that Trump and his allies are pushing.\"", "source": {"uri":

People caught without prescriptions for mifepristone and misoprostol could be fined or jailed for up to five years, or a combination of both.\n\nELECTION 2024: FOLLOW LATEST COVERAGE\n\nIt also criminalizes a person giving a pregnant woman abortion pills without consent, however, a pregnant woman who obtains the medications \"for her own consumption\" would not face criminal charges.\n\nThe bill, SB 276, is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry (R) and could become a template for other states to emulate.\n\nBut it has alarmed medical experts, abortion advocates, and Democrats who cautioned against comparing mifepristone and misoprostol with opioids, narcotics, and other addictive substances.\n\n\"We only have to look around to see the chaos and the cruelty playing out all across the country that Donald Trump created by overturning Roe v. Wade and unleashing really extreme abortion bans,\" former New Orleans Mayor and Biden campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu told reporters during a press call Thursday morning. \"And now you can see draconian legislation that is actually threatening the lives and the health of women from Florida to Ohio to Idaho to a number of states and now into Louisiana.\"\n\nEllie Schilling, an attorney in Louisiana who specializes in reproductive health, warned that SB 276 could create dire experiences for women if it becomes law.\n\n\"This bill would make it incredibly difficult to obtain and use these drugs for those medically necessary purposes,\" Schilling said. \"In fact, it could create deadly delays in emergency situations, such as women bleeding out for miscarriages or postpartum hemorrhaging.\"\n\nLouisiana bans most abortions except for medically necessary termination of a pregnancy but reproductive professionals claim that the mifepristone and misoprostol are used for other instances apart from abortion.\n\n\"What SB 276 does is it classifies mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances, which is why wildly inappropriate in terms of what these drugs actually do and are used for,\" Schilling added. \"But they would then be subject to monitoring and tracking the same as opioids are for example. So the state has a database of who is prescribing and who is receiving controlled dangerous substances and these drugs would then be added to that.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Biden campaign has repeatedly featured the testimonials of women who experienced medical complications from their pregnancies in states that heavily restrict abortion to attack Trump and the GOP.\n\nDuring Thursday's press call, Baton Rouge resident Kaitlyn Joshua shared her experience of being turned away from two emergency rooms as she dealt with a miscarriage.\n\n\"Ultimately, it took me weeks to pass my pregnancy at home and I was absolutely terrified,\" Joshua explained. \"This experience has made me see firsthand how black women die without proper maternal healthcare.\"\n\nAbortion has proven to be a powerful electoral tool, helping Democrats stave off serious electoral defeats since Roe was overturned in June 2022.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have campaigned in part as the presidential team that will protect abortion access in contrast to Trump who has taken credit for the fall of Roe by nominating the three justices that conservatively tilted the high court.\n\nThe Biden campaign repeatedly referenced a comment from Trump during an interview with Time Magazine last month where he appeared to suggest states could monitor women's pregnancies and recent comments Trump made appearing to limit contraception.\n\nBy repeatedly hammering Trump on abortion access, Democrats aim to overcome other Biden weaknesses, such as inflation and multiple global conflicts ahead of the November election.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, he's going to make things even worse. He has made that crystal clear,\" said Landrieu. \"Just yesterday, Donald Trump said that he would support states who choose to restrict contraception. He's kind of walked that back now.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nTrump claimed he would share his policy on contraception during a Pittsburgh television interview. But after the Biden campaign slammed Trump over the remarks he took to social media to clarify his stance.\n\n\"I DO NOT SUPPORT A BAN ON BIRTH CONTROL, AND NEITHER WILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!\" Trump declared.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The bill aims to classify mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV controlled dangerous substances, placing them in the same category as some narcotics and depressants. This legislative move is seen as an extension of the state's already draconian abortion laws, which ban abortion with no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThis move echoes Attorney General Steve Marshall's crusade in Alabama to attack reproductive health, threatening to prosecute women who use these medications.\n\nThe bill passed the GOP-dominated House with a vote of 64-29 and is now heading back to the Senate for final approval. If enacted, possession of these medications without a valid prescription could lead to fines, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. However, the legislation exempts pregnant women who obtain these drugs for self-induced abortions from prosecution, focusing instead on those who distribute the drugs illegally.\n\nThis legislative push has drawn severe criticism from the medical community and reproductive rights advocates. Over 240 healthcare professionals have signed a letter condemning the bill, arguing that it is \"not scientifically based\" and could hinder the legitimate medical use of these drugs, which are crucial for treating miscarriages, inducing labor, and managing other gynecological conditions. Dr. Nicole Freehill, an OB-GYN from New Orleans, highlighted to NBC News, the critical role these medications play in everyday medical practice, emphasizing that they are essential beyond abortion care.\n\nIn Alabama, the situation is equally dire. Marshall has threatened to prosecute women who use these medications under a chemical-endangerment law, despite the state's anti-abortion law explicitly not targeting women who receive abortions. This announcement followed the FDA's decision to allow certified pharmacies to dispense mifepristone, further igniting the debate over abortion rights. Marshall's initial statement suggested a willingness to criminalize women directly, only to later backtrack and clarify that his primary target was the providers rather than the women themselves.\n\nThe overarching narrative here is clear: states like Louisiana and Alabama are not just satisfied with banning abortions; they are actively seeking ways to penalize and criminalize the use of medical resources that women rely on for their reproductive health. This approach not only threatens women's autonomy but also puts their health at risk by potentially delaying necessary medical care.\n\nAnti-abortion advocates, such as Louisiana Right to Life, defend the legislation as a necessary step to protect women and unborn children from the so-called dangers of abortion medications. However, this perspective starkly contrasts with the views of medical professionals who see these drugs as safe and essential.\n\nAs these states continue their regressive march, it becomes increasingly evident that the fight for reproductive rights is far from over. The moves by Louisiana and Alabama reflect a broader strategy to restrict access to abortion through any means possible, creating a perilous landscape for women seeking to exercise their reproductive rights.", "source": {"uri": "alreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alabama Political Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_britt@alreporter.com", "name": "Bill Britt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misoprostol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misoprostol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled Substances Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-induced_abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-induced abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics_and_gynaecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obstetrics and gynaecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gynaecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Menopause", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Menopause", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.alreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AdobeStock_441128200-scaled-e1716375830434-1024x576.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588109", "eventUri": "eng-9588109", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

People caught without prescriptions for mifepristone and misoprostol could be fined or jailed for up to five years, or a combination of both.\n\nELECTION 2024: FOLLOW LATEST COVERAGE\n\nIt also criminalizes a person giving a pregnant woman abortion pills without consent, however, a pregnant woman who obtains the medications \"for her own consumption\" would not face criminal charges.\n\nThe bill, SB 276, is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jeff Landry (R) and could become a template for other states to emulate.\n\nBut it has alarmed medical experts, abortion advocates, and Democrats who cautioned against comparing mifepristone and misoprostol with opioids, narcotics, and other addictive substances.\n\n\"We only have to look around to see the chaos and the cruelty playing out all across the country that Donald Trump created by overturning Roe v.

So the state has a database of who is prescribing and who is receiving controlled dangerous substances and these drugs would then be added to that.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign has repeatedly featured the testimonials of women who experienced medical complications from their pregnancies in states that heavily restrict abortion to attack Trump and the GOP.\n\nDuring Thursday's press call, Baton Rouge resident Kaitlyn Joshua shared her experience of being turned away from two emergency rooms as she dealt with a miscarriage.\n\n\"Ultimately, it took me weeks to pass my pregnancy at home and I was absolutely terrified,\" Joshua explained. \"This experience has made me see firsthand how black women die without proper maternal healthcare.\"\n\nAbortion has proven to be a powerful electoral tool, helping Democrats stave off serious electoral defeats since Roe was overturned in June 2022.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have campaigned in part as the presidential team that will protect abortion access in contrast to Trump who has taken credit for the fall of Roe by nominating the three justices that conservatively tilted the high court.\n\nThe Biden campaign repeatedly referenced a comment from Trump during an interview with Time Magazine last month where he appeared to suggest states could monitor women's pregnancies and recent comments Trump made appearing to limit contraception.\n\nBy repeatedly hammering Trump on abortion access, Democrats aim to overcome other Biden weaknesses, such as inflation and multiple global conflicts ahead of the November election.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, he's going to make things even worse.

If Louisiana is successful, it could provide a blueprint for other state legislatures seeking to restrict abortions.\n\nThe state Senate passed a version of the bill last month. It was amended in the House to include language labeling the medications as Schedule IV drugs and now must go back to the Senate before it goes to Gov. Jeff Landry, who is expected to sign the bill.\n\nThe measure also has the support of Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill. Both Landry and Murrill are Republicans.\n\nLouisiana state law already prohibits most abortions except in life-threatening situations, but the two drugs are still prescribed for other purposes in the state, including for the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage or ulcers.\n\nOriginally, the bill, Senate Bill 276, would penalize individuals who attempt to give a pregnant woman the drugs without her consent. But the Louisiana House amended the bill Tuesday to make possession of these drugs without a prescription subject to a penalty of five to 10 years of jail time and/or a fine of $10,000 to $75,000.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration typically determine which substances are classified as controlled substances because of their likelihood to be abused, how addictive they are and if they have any medical use.\n\nThe bill would list mifepristone and misoprostol as Schedule IV drugs. Schedule IV drugs include substances with a medical use that have a low likelihood to be abused but whose use may cause a physical or psychological dependence. The category includes drugs like diazepam, sold under the brand name Valium and used to treat anxiety or seizures, and eszopiclone, sold under the name Lunesta and used to treat insomnia.\n\nStates can also schedule drugs, and in some cases will implement tougher regulations for some drugs than at the federal level. This also enables the state to track which providers are prescribing the drugs and which patients are receiving them through what are known as prescription drug monitoring programs.\n\nProponents of the legislation, like SBA Pro-Life America Southern Regional Director Caitlin Connors, said the reclassification of the two drugs should be \"uncontroversial.\"\n\n\"Like morphine and Valium, the drugs in question will still be available for prescription for legitimate medical reasons -- like miscarriage care -- but will be harder for abusers to obtain,\" she said.\n\nThe Louisiana Society of Addiction Medicine opposes the bill and has urged the legislature to find a different pathway to punish anyone who uses the drugs on another individual without their consent.\n\nThe organization's president said its board, which is composed of physicians who support and oppose abortion rights, believes the bill would not prevent black market access of the drug and could result in more deaths of postpartum women.\n\nThe group also said the scheduling framework is intended to regulate drugs associated with substance use, and this model would have unintended effects like decreasing the likelihood the drugs are prescribed for legitimate purposes.\n\nPolitical pushback\n\nThe prospect of a new type of restriction on medication abortion occurs as advocates are awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on mifepristone regulations. The two fights have fired up Democrats campaigning on the issue of reproductive rights.\n\n\"If Louisiana is successful in passing this dangerous bill into law, other Republican-led states will follow,\" said Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee National Press Secretary Sam Paisley. \"The only way to stop this onslaught of Republican attacks in Louisiana and across the country is by making a concerted effort to build Democratic power in state legislatures.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign criticized the legislation Wednesday, lining up Louisianans to discuss its impact. Democrats are pushing reproductive health as their central campaign issue.\n\nMitch Landrieu, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign co-chair, said that \"monitoring these pregnancies is going to have a huge chilling effect on women getting the kind of care that they need to manage and handle their pregnancies.\" He said the bill includes language related to racketeering charges, which could result in a friend or family member facing criminal penalties for attempting to help a woman access the medications.\n\nEllie Schilling, an adjunct professor at Tulane Law School and reproductive health law expert, called the bill language \"wildly inappropriate in terms of what these drugs actually do and are used for.\"\n\n\"This legislation would lead to the government monitoring both pregnant women and those who prescribe these medications. The state of Louisiana would effectively be creating a database of prescriptions for every woman who is prescribed mifepristone and misoprostol, regardless of the reason,\" she said during a Biden campaign call Wednesday.\n\nKaitlyn Joshua, a woman from Baton Rouge, spoke about her experience being turned away for treatment from two emergency rooms while having a miscarriage in 2022, following the Dobbs decision.\n\n\"Ultimately, it took me weeks to pass my pregnancy at home and I was absolutely terrified,\" said Joshua on the call. \"What I experienced can happen in all 50 states across this country if Trump returns to the White House.\"\n\nLouisiana State Sen. Thomas Pressly, the bill's sponsor, accused Vice President Kamala Harris of \"blatantly lying about my bill\" in response to her tweet about it. Pressly said he was inspired to introduce the bill after his sister was tricked into ingesting the drugs.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has not weighed in on the Louisiana legislation and has largely stayed away from making sweeping policy commitments regarding abortion on the campaign trail.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump stated he was considering changes to contraception access before walking back the statement.\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

{"id": 239737976, "title": "Bowman campaigns with AOC and Bernie Sanders days ahead of critical primary", "text": "Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) hosted a campaign event Saturday in the Bronx, New York, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), just three days before his primary election. Bowman, a member of the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d in the House of Representatives, is facing a tough primary challenge from Westchester County Executive George Latimer. RealClearPolitics polling data from earlier this month showed the incumbent trailing by 17 percentage points. The war in Gaza has been one of the most critical matters in the primary race between Bowman and Latimer. The congressman was among the first lawmakers to call for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in the wake of the terrorist group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on the Jewish state. Since then, Latimer\u2019s campaign has received $14 million in contributions from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. \u201cWhat this campaign is about is telling the billionaire class and their greed and their super PACs that they are not going to destroy American democracy,\u201d Sanders told rally attendees Saturday. Ocasio-Cortez took that sentiment even further, telling the crowd \u201cThey don\u2019t give a damn about us. These Wall Street people don\u2019t give a damn about us. AIPAC doesn\u2019t give a damn about us. AIPAC doesn\u2019t give a damn about the Bronx. They don\u2019t give a damn about Westchester.\u201d Bowman\u2019s Democratic House colleague also called out the \u201cbig-money interests,\u201d saying it was \u201cnot lost on us\u201d that they \u201cwant to make an example of\u201d a black man. \u201cIt is also not lost on us that the historic amounts of money being spent to defeat him are linked back to billionaires and Republicans who prop up Donald Trump and all of his thugs,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. While Bowman and his allies highlight the money Latimer\u2019s campaign has received from special interest groups, the Westchester County executive portrays the congressman as extreme. \u201cJamaal Bowman puts his extreme ideology ahead of us,\u201d Latimer\u2019s website reads. \u201cBowman sided with MAGA Republicans \u2014 one of only six Democrats to vote AGAINST a historic infrastructure bill \u2013 just to stick it to our Democratic President. In doing so, Bowman voted against rebuilding roads and critical flood protection and relief, against replacing dangerous lead water pipes, and against good-paying jobs.\u201d The winner of the Democratic primary in New York\u2019s 16th Congressional District is likely to go on to win the seat, as the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the district \u201cSolid Democrat.\u201d \u201cWe need record turnout all across the district,\u201d Bowman said alongside Ocasio-Cortez in a video posted to social media. \u201cIt\u2019s the many vs. the money. We\u2019re going to win.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win, we\u2019re going to take on AIPAC, and we\u2019re going to kick some Wall Street a**.\u201d", "summary": "Rep.

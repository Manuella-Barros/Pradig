Governor Aiyedatiwa stated this during the party\u2019s stakeholders meeting attended by leaders of the party from the 18 local government areas of the state at the International Event Center, in Akure. Addressing the party leaders, the governor stressed the need for unity within the party, noting that a cohesive and united front is essential for ensuring the party\u2019s success in the November 16 gubernatorial election. He emphasised his administration\u2019s commitment to inclusiveness while ensuring that all party leaders and members are involved in every decision. Describing the primary election as a family affair, Governor Aiyedatiwa urged every member to support one another in unity, reaffirming their collective responsibility in working towards victory for the APC. \u201cWhile we may have disagreements at times, it does not mean we are not part of the same party. Let us work together for our victory on November 16. Our party members need continuous encouragement, not just during election periods. Everything I have promised will come to fruition, they are not just mere words. In this administration, it is action over words. \u201cConsidering our current position, it appears we have already won the battle due to our hard work, but there is no room for complacency. I encourage our party leaders to return to their respective local governments, put in even more effort, and unite everyone\u201d, he added. Earlier, the APC Chairman in the state, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, in his welcome address, emphasised that every political party has its own constitution and rules that all members must follow. He noted that while the primary election has been concluded, it is crucial for party members to unite as one family in preparation for the real election on November 16. \u201cThe primary was merely an in-house affair, now is the time for unity. Together we are strong; divided we are weak. We must pool our strength. One person cannot achieve this alone, which is why unity is essential. We need to be sincere with one another, as that is the essence of politics,\u201d he stated. Former Commissioner for Women Affairs in the state, Adebunmi Osadahun urged the governor to include more women in his administration, assuring him that the women of Ondo State are firmly behind him. Also, one of the APC gubernatorial aspirants in the April 20 primary election, Morayo Lebi, remarked that the stakeholders meeting was a welcome development and a positive step forward. He commended Governor Aiyedatiwa for his efforts to unify all party members, and appealed to all aggrieved party members to come together and support the governor to emerge victorious at the poll.", "summary": "&#160; Ondo State Governor, Lucky Aiyedatiwa has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) remains a united and indivisible family regardless of individual ambitions and differences.

However, in June 2022, nearly two years ago, the feuding brothers managed to set their differences aside to pay tribute to their late grandmother, the Queen, during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations. This marked Harry and his wife Meghan's first public appearance at a Royal event since they stepped down from Royal duties, reports the Mirror. Despite uniting for the occasion, the brothers were seated a considerable distance apart and were not observed conversing or even standing next to each other. The strained service was also attended by William's wife, Kate. Following the service, the couple were spotted engaging in conversation on the cathedral steps as they awaited their car to transport them to a lunch reception at the Guildhall. A lipreader has now disclosed what he believes they said during this exchange, which included a distinct directive from William to Kate. Lip reading expert John Cassidy suggests that upon exiting onto the steps, Kate commented on the service, stating: \"It went very well, very well\", to which William responded: \"Yes, perfect.\" Subsequently, William was seen greeting the crowd with a wave and, according to Mr Cassidy, the prince then instructed Kate: \"Wait for that to move, then we can go.\" Meanwhile, a body language expert who observed the Royal brothers at the same event has suggested that Prince William gave Prince Harry \"the opposite of an acknowledgement\" and used a \"barrier gesture\". Body language specialist Judi James spoke to the Mirror about William's actions as he and Kate passed by the pew where Harry was seated on their way to their seats. Judi described: \"Harry looked firmly resigned to the back row here and was not sitting behind his brother as he was for the last service of remembrance. \"Harry's expression did suggest some relief as he joked with Zara as he searched for his car on the way out and he threw a wide, open-mouthed grin in her direction from the pews, but otherwise he fell into a haunted eye expression with some rapid blinking to suggest inner anxiety, leaning in and down to Meghan when she spoke as though keen to get some support. \"There was the opposite to an acknowledgement from William as he walked past Harry's row during the parade out of the service. Sucking in his lips and with his chin pulled up in a gesture of resolve he appeared to turn his head in the other direction for a moment, raising his order of service high in a barrier gesture.\" Following the Jubilee in summer 2022, Princes William and Harry found themselves united once more due to the passing of their beloved grandmother, the Queen. Alongside their wives, Kate and Meghan, they participated in a joint walkabout in Windsor, acknowledging floral tributes and greeting throngs of well-wishers. However, despite this apparent temporary ceasefire, it seems their relationship has further soured in the wake of Harry and Meghan's Netflix series and Harry's contentious memoir, 'Spare'.

His body was discovered in a rocky area beside Agia Marina on Symi on Sunday after an extensive search led by emergency workers, around 30-minutes walk from the village of Pedi where Dr Mosley was last seen on CCTV. The 67-year-old TV personality was with his wife and friends at Agios Nikolaos beach on Wednesday, before going alone for a walk to the centre of the island. In a statement from his agent to the PA news agency, Dr Clare Bailey Mosley said: \"I don't know quite where to begin with this. It's devastating to have lost Michael, my wonderful, funny, kind and brilliant husband. \"We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together. I am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days. \"My family and I have been hugely comforted by the outpouring of love from people from around the world. It's clear that Michael meant a huge amount to so many of you. \"We're taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it. He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn't be easily seen by the extensive search team. \"Michael was an adventurous man, it's part of what made him so special. We are so grateful to the extraordinary people on Symi who have worked tirelessly to help find him. \"Some of these people on the island, who hadn't even heard of Michael, worked from dawn till dusk unasked. We're also very grateful to The Press who have dealt with us with great respect. \"I feel so lucky to have our children and my amazing friends. Most of all, I feel so lucky to have had this life with Michael. Thank you all\" A heartbroken cameraman who discovered the body this morning emotionally addressed the TV doctor's family as he recounted the events of the search. Michael was reported missing on the Greek islands of Symi earlier this week prompting a huge search and rescue operation. He was spotted on CCTV in a nearby town carrying an umbrella as he shaded himself from the sun. Tragically, an umbrella was also discovered near to where the body was found this morning - which was in a rocky area behind a chainlink fence beside Agia Marina on Symi, around 30 minutes walk from where Michael was last seen in Pedi. The person who discovered the body was a cameraman named Antionios, who broke down and became very emotional as he recalled the moment he made the grim discovery. He explained how they took a photo of the screen with an iPhone before zooming in and being able to \"clearly see\" that it was a man \"lying down\" with \"his hand on his belly\", the Mirror reports. He then said: \"The description is exactly of the guy we were looking for.\" He broke down and emotionally added: \"I'm really sorry for the family, I'm sorry that I'm the one to find him. I wish we had better news.\" Commenting on the video interview shared by Sky, one X user penned: \"This is a tragic and heartbreaking situation. Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of Dr. Michael Mosley. We hope that they are able to find some comfort and peace during this difficult time.\" Another penned: \"This is just too sad. I really feel for his family and the people who found him.\" While a third said: \"So very sad, seemingly so close to getting help and shelter too at Agia Marina. The dangers of the sun and heat. I have passed out many times. It\u2019s dangerous and happens quick without warning\u2026 thinking of Michael Morley\u2019s family. Was hoping for a positive outcome.\" It had been confirmed earlier on Sunday morning that Greek search and rescue teams had withdrawn their sniffer dog and returned to Athens, reportedly over fears of the impact of the prolonged heat on the animal. Mosley, known for his appearances on The One Show and This Morning, and fronting of documentaries was on holiday with his wife Clare at the time. He also advocated intermittent fasting through the 5:2 diet and The Fast 800 diet. Mosley has four children with his wife Clare Bailey Mosley, also a doctor, author and health columnist, who wrote the recipe book Fast 800 Easy. The couple, who have hosted theatre show tours together, recently attended the Hay Festival, where Mosley presented a special edition of his Radio 4 series and podcast Just One Thing.

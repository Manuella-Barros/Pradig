Only 316 survived, 22 of whom are alive today.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten,\" Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, said. \"They can serve as inspiration to current and future sailors enduring situations of mortal peril.

The team was assisted by historians from the Naval history and Heritage Command in Washington.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" said Allen in a statement provided to USNI News on Saturday.\"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances. While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nThe USS Indianapolis was sunk July 30, 1945 in the final days of World War II after completing a secret mission to the island Tinian, delivering components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nThe ship sunk in 12 minutes, before a distress signal could be sent or much of the life-saving equipment could be deployed, according to a statement from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, D.C. Because of the secrecy surrounding the mission, the ship wasn't listed as overdue\n\nAround 800 of the ship's 1,196 sailors and Marines survived the sinking, but after four to five days in the water, suffering exposure, dehydration, drowning, and shark attacks, only 316 survived.\n\n\"I'm very happy that they found it. It's been a long 72 years coming,\" said a statement released by Indianapolis survivor Arthur Leenerman, 93 years-old from Mahomet, Ill. \"I have wished for years that they would find it. The lost at sea families will feel pretty sad but I think finding the ship will also give them some closure. I'm glad that the search was successful. It will be interesting to see where it was found and how deep it was resting. \"\n\nThe ship's story has become part folklore, thanks in large part to the chilling monologue in the 1975 film \"Jaws\" when fisherman Quint tells about being aboard Indianapolis when it was sunk.\n\nAllen's break came a year ago when Richard Hulver, a NHHC historian, discovered records from amphibious landing ship USS LST-779 that recorded a sighting of Indianapolis hours before it was torpedoed, according to a statement from NHHC. Hulver's research led to a new search area west of the original presumed position. Still, the new search area was in 600 square-miles of open North Pacific Ocean water.\n\n\"Teams have tried to find Indianapolis in the past, but failed, partly because she is over two miles down, but also because they were looking in the wrong place,\" wrote Hulver in an analysis of the new information published by NHHC last summer. \"Historical records specifying the sinking location do not exist, as no distress signal providing the location of Indianapolis was received.

They are complying with U.S. law and respecting the sunken ship as a war grave, taking care not to disturb the site. The Indianapolis remains the property of the U.S. Navy and its location will remain confidential and restricted by the Navy.\n\nThe crew of the R/V Petrel has collaborated with Navy authorities throughout its search operations and will continue to work on plans to honor the 19 crew members still alive today, as well as the families of all those who served on the highly decorated cruiser.",

Allen said Saturday they have found the wreck of the World War II cruiser USS Indianapolis (CA 35), which was lost July 30, 1945.\n\nThis is a significant discovery considering the depth of the water in which the ship was lost -- more than 18,000 feet, the U.S. Navy and Paul Allen said in press releases issued Saturday. Around 800 of the ship's 1,196 Sailors and Marines survived the sinking, but after four to five days in the water -- suffering exposure, dehydration, drowning, and shark attacks -- only 316 survived.\n\nThe wreck was located by the expedition crew of Research Vessel (R/V) Petrel, which is owned by Allen, resting on the floor in the Phillipine Sea.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" said Allen, whose real estate portfolio includes the \"Thurston Estate\" on Kailua Bay. \"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances. While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nIndianapolis was lost in the final days of World War II when it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine in the early morning hours of July 30, 1945. The Indianapolis sank in 12 minutes, making it impossible to send a distress signal or deploy much of its life-saving equipment. Prior to the attack, the Indianapolis had just completed a secret mission delivering components of the atomic bomb used in Hiroshima that would ultimately help end the war in the Pacific, the Navy said.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten,\" said Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command. \"They can serve as inspiration to current and future Sailors enduring situations of mortal peril. There are also lessons learned, and in the case of the Indianapolis, lessons re-learned, that need to be preserved and passed on, so the same mistakes can be prevented, and lives saved.\"\n\nOthers have searched for Indianapolis in the past. Among the elements that made this effort different was Allen's recent acquisition and retrofit of the 250-foot R/V Petrel with state-of-the-art subsea equipment capable of diving to 3.5 miles in depth.\n\n\"The Petrel and its capabilities, the technology it has and the research we've done, are the culmination years of dedication and hard work,\" said Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations for Allen. \"We've assembled and integrated this technology, assets and unique capability into operating platform, which is now one amongst very few on the planet.\"\n\nThe other key factor in the discovery was information that surfaced in 2016 when Richard Hulver, historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, conducted research that led to a new search area to the west of the original presumed position.\n\nHulver's research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of Indianapolis hours before it was torpedoed. Using that information, the research team developed a new position and estimated search, which was still a daunting 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel is in the process of surveying the full site and will conduct a live tour of the wreckage in the next few weeks.\n\nTheir work is compliant with U.S. law, respecting the sunken ship as a war grave and not disturbing the site. USS Indianapolis remains the property of the U.S. Navy and its location will remain confidential and restricted by the Navy.\n\nThe crew of the R/V Petrel has collaborated with Navy authorities throughout its search operations and will continue to work on plans to honor the 22 crew members still alive today, as well as the families of all those who served on the highly decorated cruiser, the Navy said.\n\n\"For more than two decades I've been working with the survivors. To a man, they have longed for the day when their ship would be found, solving their final mystery,\" said Capt. William Toti (Ret), spokesperson for the survivors of the USS Indianapolis. \"They all know this is now a war memorial, and are grateful for the respect and dignity that Paul Allen and his team have paid to one of the most tangible manifestations of the pain and sacrifice of our World War II veterans.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:19:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.843137264251709, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "23:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "177", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "66684", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "227084", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302944", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "score": 4}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 5}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304139", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "score": 3}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 4}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 3}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 3}, {"id": "381126", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "score": 2}, {"id": "389079", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naval History & Heritage Command"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_History_&_Heritage_Command", "score": 3}, {"id": "395733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "score": 2}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 5}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 5}], "image": "http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/sites/westhawaiitoday.com/files/field/image/5813249_web1_Indy-Spares-Box-zoomed-in.jpg", "timeCrawl": "23:19:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Wreckage from the USS Indianapolis located", "originalArticle": null}

While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nThe Indianapolis sank in 12 minutes, making it impossible for it to send a distress signal or deploy life-saving equipment. Before the attack, on July 30, 1945, it had just completed a secret mission delivering components of the atomic bomb used in Hiroshima that brought an end to the war in the Pacific, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington.\n\nMost of the ship's 1,196 sailors and Marines survived the sinking only to succumb to exposure, dehydration and drowning after four to five days. Only 316 survived, 22 of whom are alive today.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten,\" Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, said. \"They can serve as inspiration to current and future sailors enduring situations of mortal peril.

Since the sunken ship is a war grave, it is protected by US law from being disturbed.\n\nThe search vessel's crew has been working in collaboration with Navy authorities and is developing plans to honor survivors still living as well as the families of the deceased.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten,\" said Sam Cox, the Naval history command's director.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:43:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "03:43:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "177", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "66684", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "178941", "label": {"eng": "Tinian Island"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinian", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tinian Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Northern Mariana Islands"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 2}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 4}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 4}, {"id": "304145", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 4}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 4}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 3}, {"id": "352683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "score": 1}, {"id": "389079", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naval History & Heritage Command"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_History_&_Heritage_Command", "score": 2}, {"id": "395733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "score": 2}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 5}, {"id": "786160", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia", "score": 3}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GJYHW0sTLn3oQZ5EktV8EQ--/aD02NjQ7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/3875b45df41689baa540d1c3c4f0c49bbf3fa46e.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:43:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Wreckage of lost ship USS Indianapolis found after seven decades", "originalArticle": null}

There were only 316 survivors in the end.\n\nAllen shared the first photos of the wreckage revealing an anchor and the ship's bell. He expressed hope that survivors and families of those who died would gain closure from the find.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role during World War II is truly humbling,\" he said.\n\n22 crew members are still alive today. 93 year-old Indianapolis survivor Arthur Leenerman said in a statement cited by USNI that he wished many years for this day and was glad the search was a success.\n\n\"I'm very happy that they found it. It's been a long 72 years coming,\" he said adding that \"it will be interesting to see where it was found and how deep it was resting.\"\n\nThe ship, which garnered new prominence in 1972 thanks to a chilling speech in blockbuster movie 'Jaws,' had been the subject of several searches before Allen's 16-person expedition found its final resting place.\n\nThe 250-foot research vessel Petrel which carried out the search was recently retrofitted with state-of-the-art subsea equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters.\n\nAnother important contribution leading to the successful search was the discovery of new information last year.\n\nDr. Richard Hulver, historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, found records from a ship that had recorded a sighting of Indianapolis just hours before it was torpedoed.\n\nThis narrowed the search to an area west of the original presumed position but still encompassing 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe US Navy said the USS Indianapolis

The fate of its crew -- nearly 900 were killed, many by sharks, and just 316 survived -- was one of the Pacific war's more horrible and fascinating tales.\n\nThe expedition crew of Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, says it located the wreckage of the Indianapolis on the floor of the North Pacific Ocean, more than 18,000 feet (5,500 meters) below the surface, the U.S. Navy said in a news release Saturday.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said in the news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis, with 1,196 sailors and Marines on board, was sailing the Philippine Sea between Guam and Leyte Gulf when two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine struck just after midnight on July 30, 1945. It sank in 12 minutes, killing about 300. Survivors were left in the water, most of them with only life jackets.\n\nWe've located wreckage of USS Indianapolis in Philippine Sea at 5500m below the sea. '35' on hull 1st confirmation: https://t.co/V29TLj1Ba4pic.twitter.com/y5S7AU6OEl -- Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThere was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot the survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship's original number alive.\n\nOver the years numerous books recounted the ship's disaster and its role in delivering key components of what would become the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian, the take-off point for the bomber Enola Gay's mission to Hiroshima in August 1945. Documentaries and movies, most recently \"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\" (2016) starring Nicolas Cage, have recounted the crew's horror-filled days at sea. The Indianapolis sinking also was a plot point in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster \"Jaws\" (1975), with the fictitious survivor Capt. Quint recounting the terror he felt waiting to be rescued.\n\nThe Navy news release issued Saturday said a key to finding the Indianapolis came in 2016 when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, determined a new search area. Hulver's research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis the day before it sank. The research team developed a new search area, although it was still 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site. The team's work has been compliant with U.S. law regarding a sunken warship as a military grave not to be disturbed, according to the Navy. The wrecked ship remains the property of the Navy and its location is both confidential and restricted, it said.\n\nImportant chapter of WWII history concludes--I hope survivors/families gain some closure.

Before the attack, on July 30, 1945, it had just completed a secret mission delivering components of the atomic bomb used in Hiroshima that brought an end to the war in the Pacific, according to a statement from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington.\n\nMost of the ship's 1,196 sailors and Marines survived the sinking only to succumb to exposure, dehydration and drowning after four to five days. Only 316 survived, 22 of whom are alive today.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten,\" Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, said. \"They can serve as inspiration to current and future sailors enduring situations of mortal peril. There are also lessons learned, and in the case of the Indianapolis, lessons re-learned, that need to be preserved and passed on, so the same mistakes can be prevented, and lives saved.\"\n\nOthers have tried to locate the Indianapolis before.

Courtesy Bureau of Ships Collection in the U.S. National Archives/U.S. Navy/Handout via REUTERS\n\nResearchers have found the wreckage of the U.S. warship Indianapolis, which was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the final days of World War Two, more than 18,000 feet (5.5 kilometers) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, the Navy said on Saturday.\n\nThe cruiser was returning from its mission to deliver components for the atomic bomb that would soon be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima when it was fired upon in the North Pacific Ocean by a Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945.\n\nIt sunk in 12 minutes, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington. No distress signal was sent. About 800 of the 1,196 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.\n\nAfter a Navy historian unearthed new information in 2016 about the warship's last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1,500-square-kilometer) patch of ocean.\n\nWith a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen's team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The statement said the Navy had asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.\n\nAllen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honoring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending World War Two. \"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" he said.\n\nIdentification was easier than in some deep-sea expeditions: some of the exposed wreck was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the Navy.\n\n\"It is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,\" Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a telephone interview. \"If that's not Indianapolis then I don't know what is.\"\n\nThe Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship's crew.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Allen;

The research team developed a new search area, although it was still 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site.

Allen, located the World War II cruiser 5,500 meters -- that's nearly 3.5 miles -- below the water's surface, according to a Saturday release from the U.S. Navy.\n\nA Japanese submarine torpedoed the USS Indianapolis on the morning of July 30, 1945, sinking the ship with 1,196 sailors and Marines aboard. The ship is said to have sunk within 12 minutes, with around 800 sailors and Marines surviving initially but with no time to use life-saving provisions or send a distress signal. A combination of dehydration, exposure, drowning and shark attacks over the four to five days spent in the open water led to more deaths, with 316 surviving the incident.\n\nLast month, seven survivors convened in Indianapolis to honor those who lost their lives, as well as to view a new documentary about the incident.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see this day come! I'm glad it was found,\" Dick Thelen, a 90-year-old USS Indianapolis survivor and vice chairman of the Survivors' Organization said upon hearing the news, according to a release from the survivors group.\n\nBefore the ship was fired on, it had completed a secret mission delivering components of the atomic bomb that would be used in Hiroshima, leading up to the end of the war in the Pacific.\n\nWhile other expeditions have sought to discover the USS Indianapolis, those involved with the Petrel expedition say a combination of technology, research and new information uncovered in 2016 about a possible location for the ship helped make their exploration a success.\n\nAccording to the release, the team has planned to survey the full wreckage site and conduct a live tour in coming weeks. The U.S. Navy has also said crews will not disturb the site, but rather treat the sunken ship as a war grave.\n\nNever miss another Facebook post from WISH-TV", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:34:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "21:34:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "66684", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "235512", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302999", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "score": 2}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 4}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 2}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 4}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 3}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 4}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 4}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 3}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 3}, {"id": "319300", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "score": 3}, {"id": "348727", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Surrender of Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan", "score": 2}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 3}, {"id": "368513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Distress signal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal", "score": 3}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 5}, {"id": "531517", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sinking of the RMS Titanic"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic", "score": 3}, {"id": "575758", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Arctic exploration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_exploration", "score": 2}], "image": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/indy3.jpg?w=640", "timeCrawl": "21:34:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "USS Indianapolis found after 72 years", "originalArticle": null}

Quint recounting the terror he felt waiting to be rescued.\n\n#RVPetrel's search for #USSIndianapolis continues -- more info and pictures to come: https://t.co/8nNBj1iaO4 pic.twitter.com/bzD86dSX57 -- Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen)\n\nAugust 19, 2017\n\nThe Navy news release issued Saturday said a key to finding the Indianapolis came in 2016 when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, determined a new search area. Hulver's research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis the day before it sank. The research team developed a new search area, although it was still 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site. The team's work has been compliant with U.S. law regarding a sunken warship as a military grave not to be disturbed, according to the Navy. The wrecked ship remains the property of the Navy and its location is both confidential and restricted, it said.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:30:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 1189, "textStart":

No distress signal was sent.

Friday, a team of civilian researchers led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen discovered the cruiser's wreckage on the floor of the North Pacific Ocean, 18,000 feet below the surface, bringing closure to one of most tragic maritime disasters in US naval history.\n\nNaval researchers announced Saturday that they have found the wreckage of the lost World War II cruiser USS Indianapolis on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, 72 years after the vessel sank in minutes after it was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.\n\nThe ship was found almost 3 1/2 miles below the surface of the Philippine Sea, said a tweet from Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul G. Allen, who led a team of civilian researchers that made the discovery.\n\nHistorians and architects from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, District of Columbia, had joined forces with Allen last year to revisit the tragedy.\n\nThe ship sank in 15 minutes on July 30, 1945, in the war's final days, and it took the Navy four days to realize that the vessel was missing.\n\nAbout 800 of the crew's 1,200 sailors and Marines made it off the cruiser before it sank. But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said in a news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the command call the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said in a statement. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay III, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades.\n\nThe coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said. The ship's mission records and logs were lost in the wreck.\n\nResearchers got a break last year, however, when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis hours before it was sunk. The position was west of where it was presumed to be lying. The team was able to develop a new estimated position, although it still covered 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe ship is an official war grave, which means it is protected by law from disturbances. Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nHulver and Robert Neyland, the command's underwater archaeology branch head, wrote on the website that \"there remains a lot we can learn.\"\n\n\"From the sinking to the battle damage and site formation processes, we hope to gain a better understanding about the wreck site and how we can better protect USS Indianapolis to honor the service of the ship and crew.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:14:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "02:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "180884", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "score": 1}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 2}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304059", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "score": 2}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 5}, {"id": "304164", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 5}, {"id": "304714", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "score": 2}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 5}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 5}, {"id": "309880", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "score": 1}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 3}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 3}, {"id": "319300", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "score": 3}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 3}, {"id": "345830", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue", "score": 2}, {"id": "352683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "score": 3}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 4}, {"id": "1049579", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Charles B.

Only 22 members of its crew are still alive.\n\nThe ship was located on the floor of the northern Pacific Ocean at a depth of more than 18,000 feet. It was located by scientists aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which Allen owns. The Petrel has tracked down other warships lost at sea during the conflict using its state-of-the-art subsea monitoring equipment.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said. \"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances. While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nThe Naval History and Heritage Command said there were several complicating factors that, until recently, had prevented scientists from locating the final resting place of the Indianapolis. Because the ship sank so quickly, the crew did not have time to send a distress signal indicating their final coordinates. The Navy did not realize the ship was even missing for four days, until it failed to arrive at its scheduled port.\n\nThe delayed rescue response complicated what was an already difficult evacuation for the ship's crew and was partly to blame for the high number of sailors lost at sea. Crew members didn't have time to deploy most the ship's lifeboats or other survival gear before it went down. Hundreds of sailors died of exposure and shark attacks while floating in the ocean for nearly a week before help arrived.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the ship's captain, who survived the attack, said the Indianapolis was exactly on its prescribed course headed to port when it was hit. The ship had just completed a covert mission delivering components of the atomic bomb that would be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nThe captain's recollection was incorrect, leading researchers to search an area of the sea floor farther west than where it was eventually located. NHHC historians discovered the mistake after records showed a U.S. naval landing craft in the area had spotted the Indianapolis hours before it was attacked and logged its location, giving Allen's vessel a new 600-square-mile area of ocean floor to search.\n\nUnder U.S. law, the wreckage of the Indianapolis is considered a war grave and cannot be disturbed. The Petrel's research crew is continuing to survey the sea floor and said a video tour of the site using an unmanned submarine will be conducted in the coming weeks, with the footage made available to the public.\n\nThe Navy said as part of the occasion it plans to honor the 22 surviving crew members and family of those sailors killed.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:12:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 7, "textStart": 0, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "01:12:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 2}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 4}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304145", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "score": 3}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "306965", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "score": 4}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 4}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 4}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 5}, {"id": "315021", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "score": 1}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 4}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 2}, {"id": "322496", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "score": 2}, {"id": "346911", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lifeboat (shipboard)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(shipboard)", "score": 2}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 2}, {"id": "368513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Distress signal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal", "score": 2}, {"id": "389079", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naval History & Heritage Command"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_History_&_Heritage_Command", "score": 3}, {"id": "395733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "score": 1}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 4}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 4}, {"id": "786160", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia", "score": 3}], "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1761503176598/2017/upi_com/e8a8b8ba033cc953ab880a35550afdf3/v2.1/Researchers-locate-wreckage-of-WWII-cruiser-USS-Indianapolis.jpg?lg=4", "timeCrawl": "01:12:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Researchers locate wreckage of WWII cruiser USS Indianapolis", "originalArticle": null}

It sank in 12 minutes, killing about 300. Survivors were left in the water, most of them with only life jackets.\n\nThere was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot the survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship's original number alive.\n\nImportant chapter of WWII history concludes--I hope survivors/families gain some closure.

Documentaries and movies, most recently \"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\" (2016) starring Nicolas Cage, have recounted the crew's horror-filled days at sea. The Indianapolis sinking also was a plot point in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster \"Jaws\" (1975), with the fictitious survivor Capt.

Hulver's research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis the day before it sank. The research team developed a new search area, although it was still 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site. The team's work has been compliant with U.S. law regarding a sunken warship as a military grave not to be disturbed, according to the Navy.

No distress signal was sent. About 800 of the 1,196 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.\n\nAfter a Navy historian unearthed new information in 2016 about the warship's last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1,500-square-kilometer) patch of ocean.\n\nWith a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen's team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The statement said the Navy had asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.\n\nAllen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honoring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending World War Two. \"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" he said.\n\nIdentification was easier than in some deep-sea expeditions: some of the exposed wreck was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the Navy.\n\n\"It is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,\" Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a telephone interview. \"If that's not Indianapolis then I don't know what is.\"\n\nThe Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship's crew.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:22:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "00:22:00", "lang": "eng",

Only 22 members of its crew are still alive.\n\nThe ship was located on the floor of the northern Pacific Ocean at a depth of more than 18,000 feet. It was located by scientists aboard the Research Vessel Petrel, which Allen owns. The Petrel has tracked down other warships lost at sea during the conflict using its state-of-the-art subsea monitoring equipment.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said. \"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances. While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nThe Naval History and Heritage Command said there were several complicating factors that, until recently, had prevented scientists from locating the final resting place of the Indianapolis. Because the ship sank so quickly, the crew did not have time to send a distress signal indicating their final coordinates. The Navy did not realize the ship was even missing for four days, until it failed to arrive at its scheduled port.\n\nThe delayed rescue response complicated what was an already difficult evacuation for the ship's crew and was partly to blame for the high number of sailors lost at sea. Crew members didn't have time to deploy most the ship's lifeboats or other survival gear before it went down. Hundreds of sailors died of exposure and shark attacks while floating in the ocean for nearly a week before help arrived.\n\nFurther complicating matters, the ship's captain, who survived the attack, said the Indianapolis was exactly on its prescribed course headed to port when it was hit. The ship had just completed a covert mission delivering components of the atomic bomb that would be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nThe captain's recollection was incorrect, leading researchers to search an area of the sea floor farther west than where it was eventually located. NHHC historians discovered the mistake after records showed a U.S. naval landing craft in the area had spotted the Indianapolis hours before it was attacked and logged its location, giving Allen's vessel a new 600-square-mile area of ocean floor to search.\n\nUnder U.S. law, the wreckage of the Indianapolis is considered a war grave and cannot be disturbed. The Petrel's research crew is continuing to survey the sea floor and said a video tour of the site using an unmanned submarine will be conducted in the coming weeks, with the footage made available to the public.\n\nThe Navy said as part of the occasion it plans to honor the 22 surviving crew members and family of those sailors killed.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T21:21:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 7, "textStart": 0, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "21:21:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 2}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 4}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304145", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "score": 3}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "306965", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "score": 4}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 4}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 4}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "311844", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Battleship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship", "score": 4}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 5}, {"id": "315021", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "score": 1}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 2}, {"id": "322496", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "score": 2}, {"id": "346911", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lifeboat (shipboard)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(shipboard)", "score": 2}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 2}, {"id": "368513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Distress signal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal", "score": 2}, {"id": "389079", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naval History & Heritage Command"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_History_&_Heritage_Command", "score": 3}, {"id": "395733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "score": 1}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 4}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 4}, {"id": "786160", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Asia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Asia", "score": 3}], "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1761503176598/2017/upi_com/e8a8b8ba033cc953ab880a35550afdf3/v2.1/Researchers-locate-wreckage-of-WWII-era-battleship-USS-Indianapolis.jpg?lg=4", "timeCrawl": "21:21:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Researchers locate wreckage of WWII-era battleship USS Indianapolis", "originalArticle": null}

It took only 12 minutes to sink.\n\nWhile 900 crewmen made it through the initial sinking, only 316 survived to be rescued when help arrived five days later on Aug. 2. Many had died of exposure or thirst, drowned or were attacked by sharks.\n\nFamilies of those aboard the ship found out about the deaths of their loved ones just as the rest of the country was celebrating the conclusion of World War II.\n\nThe latest break in the search for the wreckage came in July 2016, when the Naval History and Heritage Command Communication and Outreach Division reported that a sailor had confirmed that a tank landing ship, LST-779, had passed the Indianapolis 11 hours before the torpedo struck. That backed up the testimony of Captain Charles McVay III and was confirmed by deck logs.\n\nImportant chapter of WWII history concludes--I hope survivors/families gain some closure.

While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nAllen's team is still surveying the site of the wreckage and plans to conduct a live tour of the wreckage in the next few weeks. The crew is working with the Navy and plans to honor the remaining 22 USS Indianapolis crew members and families of crew members.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten,\" said Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, in a statement. \"They can serve as inspiration to current and future Sailors enduring situations of mortal peril. There are also lessons learned, and in the case of the Indianapolis, lessons re-learned, that need to be preserved and passed on, so the same mistakes can be prevented, and lives saved.\"\n\nIn March 2015, an Allen expedition team discovered the remains of the Japanese battleship Musashi, and this past March his team found the Artigliere, a World War II

There are also lessons learned, and in the case of the Indianapolis, lessons re-learned, that need to be preserved and passed on, so the same mistakes can be prevented, and lives saved.\"Others have tried to locate the Indianapolis before. The wreck was located by the expedition crew of Allen's Research Vessel Petrel, a 250-foot vessel equipped with state-of-the-art equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters, or 3 1/2 miles.The 13-person team will continue to survey the site and tour of the wreckage in compliance with relevant US law for searching war graves. Research surfaced in 2016 that led to a new search area to the west of the original presumed position. Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that recorded a sighting of Indianapolis hours before it was hit.

No distress signal was sent. About 800 of the 1,196 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.\n\nAfter a Navy historian unearthed new information in 2016 about the warship's last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1,500-square-kilometer) patch of ocean.\n\nWRECKAGE FOUND IN PHILIPPINE SEA\n\nWith a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen's team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The statement said the Navy had asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.\n\nAllen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honoring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending World War Two. \"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" he said.\n\nIdentification was easier than in some deep-sea expeditions: some of the exposed wreck was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the Navy.\n\n\"It is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,\" Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a telephone interview. \"If that's not Indianapolis then I don't know what is.\"\n\nThe Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship's crew.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n72 years of Hiroshima: When a Little Boy killed 1.4 lakh people, maimed 35,000\n\nSunken treasure INS Viraat to be a piece of underwater attraction", "dateTime":

Allen, who led a team of civilian researchers that made the discovery.\n\nHistorians and architects from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, District of Columbia, had joined forces with Allen last year to revisit the tragedy.\n\nThe ship sank in 15 minutes on July 30, 1945, in the war's final days, and it took the Navy four days to realize that the vessel was missing.\n\nAbout 800 of the crew's 1,200 sailors and Marines made it off the cruiser before it sank. But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said in a news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the command call the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said in a statement. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay III, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades.\n\nThe coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said.

Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nHulver and Robert Neyland, the command's underwater archaeology branch head, wrote on the website that \"there remains a lot we can learn.\"\n\n\"From the sinking to the battle damage and site formation processes, we hope to gain a better understanding about the wreck site and how we can better protect USS Indianapolis to honor the service of the ship and crew.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T01:50:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "01:50:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "180884", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "score": 1}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 3}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304059", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "score": 2}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "304714", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "score": 2}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 4}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 3}, {"id": "309880", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "score": 1}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 3}, {"id": "319300", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "score": 3}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 3}, {"id": "345830", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue", "score": 2}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 3}, {"id": "352683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "score": 3}, {"id": "360672", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Little Boy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy", "score": 3}, {"id": "371178", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Neyland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Neyland", "score": 1}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "1049579", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Charles B.

It sank in 12 minutes, killing about 300. Survivors were left in the water, most of them with only life jackets.\n\nThere was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot the survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship's original number alive.\n\nOver the years numerous books recounted the ship's disaster and its role in delivering key components of what would become the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian, the take-off point for the bomber Enola Gay's mission to Hiroshima in August 1945. Documentaries and movies, most recently \"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\" (2016) starring Nicolas Cage, have recounted the crew's horror-filled days at sea. The Indianapolis sinking also was a plot point in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster \"Jaws\" (1975), with the fictitious survivor Capt. Quint recounting the terror he felt waiting to be rescued.\n\nThe Navy news release issued Saturday said a key to finding the Indianapolis came in 2016 when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, determined a new search area. Hulver's research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis the day before it sank. The research team developed a new search area, although it was still 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site. The team's work has been compliant with U.S. law regarding a sunken warship as a military grave not to be disturbed, according to the Navy. The wrecked ship remains the property of the Navy and its location is both confidential and restricted, it said.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:49:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

The fate of its crew -- nearly 900 were killed, many by sharks, and just 316 survived -- was one of the Pacific war's more horrible and fascinating tales.\n\nThe expedition crew of Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, says it located the wreckage of the Indianapolis on the floor of the North Pacific Ocean, more than 18,000 feet (5,500 meters) below the surface, the U.S. Navy said in a news release Saturday.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said in the news release.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data?

It sank in 12 minutes, killing about 300. Survivors were left in the water, most of them with only life jackets.\n\nThere was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot the survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship's original number alive.\n\nOver the years numerous books recounted the ship's disaster and its role in delivering key components of what would become the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian, the take-off point for the bomber Enola Gay's mission to Hiroshima in August 1945. Documentaries and movies, most recently \"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\" (2016) starring Nicolas Cage, have recounted the crew's horror-filled days at sea.

The fate of its crew - nearly 900 were killed, many by sharks, and just 316 survived - was one of the Pacific war's more horrible and fascinating tales.\n\nThe expedition crew of Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, says it located the wreckage of the Indianapolis on the floor of the North Pacific Ocean, more than 18,000 feet (5,500 meters) below the surface, the U.S. Navy said in a news release Saturday.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said in the news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis, with 1,196 sailors and Marines on board, was sailing the Philippine Sea between Guam and Leyte Gulf when two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine struck just after midnight on July 30, 1945. It sank in 12 minutes, killing about 300. Survivors were left in the water, most of them with only life jackets.\n\nThere was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot the survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship's original number alive.\n\nOver the years numerous books recounted the ship's disaster and its role in delivering key components of what would become the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian, the take-off point for the bomber Enola Gay's mission to Hiroshima in August 1945. Documentaries and movies, most recently \"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\" (2016) starring Nicolas Cage, have recounted the crew's horror-filled days at sea. The Indianapolis sinking also was a plot point in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster \"Jaws\" (1975), with the fictitious survivor Capt. Quint recounting the terror he felt waiting to be rescued.\n\nThe Navy news release issued Saturday said a key to finding the Indianapolis came in 2016 when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, determined a new search area. Hulver's research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis the day before it sank. The research team developed a new search area, although it was still 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site. The team's work has been compliant with U.S. law regarding a sunken warship as a military grave not to be disturbed, according to the Navy. The wrecked ship remains the property of the Navy and its location is both confidential and restricted, it said.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nThe command call the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades.\n\nThe coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said. The ship's mission records and logs were lost in the wreck.\n\nResearchers got a break last year, however, when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis hours before it was sunk. The position was west of where it was presumed to be lying. The team was able to develop a new estimated position, although it still covered 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe ship is an official war grave, which means it is protected by law from disturbances. Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nHulver and Robert Neyland, the command's underwater archaeology branch head, wrote on the website that \"there remains a lot we can learn.\"\n\n\"From the sinking to the battle damage and site formation processes, we hope to gain a better understanding about the wreck site and how we can better protect USS Indianapolis to honor the service of the ship and crew.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:16:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "03:16:00", "lang": "eng",

There are also lessons learned, and in the case of the Indianapolis, lessons re-learned, that need to be preserved and passed on, so the same mistakes can be prevented, and lives saved.\"\n\n\"For more than two decades I've been working with the survivors. To a man, they have longed for the day when their ship would be found, solving their final mystery,\"\u00c2 said Capt. William Toti (Ret), spokesperson for the survivors of the USS Indianapolis. \"They all know this is now a war memorial, and are grateful for the respect and dignity that Paul Allen and his team have paid to one of the most tangible manifestations of the pain and sacrifice of our World War II veterans.\"\n\nAs the naval flagship of the Fifth Fleet, the sunken Indianapolis was the object of many previous search efforts. Mr. Allen had recently acquired and retrofitted the 250-foot R/V Petrel with state-of-the-art subsea equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters (or three and a half miles). \u00c2\n\n\"The Petrel and its capabilities, the technology it has and the research we've done, are the culmination of years of dedication and hard work,\" said Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations for Mr. Allen.\u00c2 \"We've assembled and integrated this technology, assets and unique capability into an operating platform which is now one among very few on the planet.\"\n\nThe other key factor in the discovery was information that surfaced in 2016 by Dr. Richard Hulver, historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, which led to a new search area to the west of the original presumed position.\n\nBy finally identifying a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the USS Indianapolis the night that it was torpedoed, the research team developed a new position and estimated search, which was still a daunting 600 square miles of open ocean.\u00c2\n\nAllen-led expeditions have also resulted in the discovery of the Japanese battleship Musashi (March 2015) and the Italian WWII destroyer Artigliere (March 2017). His team was also responsible for retrieving and restoring the ship's bell from the HMS Hood for presentation to the British Navy in honor of its heroic service. Mr. Allen's expedition team was recently transferred to the newly acquired and retrofitted R/V Petrel specifically for continuing exploration and research efforts.\n\nThe 16-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel will continue the process of surveying the full site as weather permits and will be conducting a live tour of the wreckage in the next few weeks. The USS Indianapolis remains the property of the U.S. Navy and its location will remain confidential and restricted by the Navy. The crew of the R/V Petrel has been collaborating with Navy authorities throughout its search operations and will continue to work on plans to honor the 22 crew members still alive today, as well as the families of all those who served on the highly decorated cruiser.\u00c2\n\nThe following links are recommended resources provided by Dr. Hulver and provide the history of the USS Indianapolis.\n\nAbout Paul G. Allen\n\nFour decades after co-founding Microsoft, entrepreneur and philanthropist Paul G. Allen is still exploring the frontiers of technology and human knowledge, and acting to change the future.\u00c2 Mr. Allen is working to save endangered species; combat climate change; improve ocean health; share art, history and film; develop new technology; tackle epidemics; research how the human brain works; and build sustainable communities.\n\nMr. Allen is deeply committed to honoring our past and the lessons it provides to our future. He has created public spaces including the Flying Heritage and Combat Armor Collection, MoPOP and the Living Computer Museum + Lab \u00e2\u0080\"where people learn and interact with historic, cultural and musical heritage. The inaugural Seattle Art Fair helped put the city on the map as one of the premier art destinations in the country. He also thinks globally, making impact investments that will help developing countries expand their health and infrastructure and nurture a diversified economy.\n\nMany of his ventures were seeded in his youth, and reflect the depth and diversity of his passions. \u00c2 Honoring his father's service in World War II, Mr. Allen is especially interested in collecting and protecting the artifacts that speak to the heroism and service of that day. His recently acquired Research Vessel Petrel provides a platform to search for historic artifacts that have been lost at sea.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:08:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 22,

Allen, who led a team of civilian researchers that made the discovery.\n\nHistorians and architects from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, District of Columbia, had joined forces with Allen last year to revisit the tragedy.\n\nThe ship sank in 15 minutes on July 30, 1945, in the war's final days, and it took the Navy four days to realize that the vessel was missing.\n\nAbout 800 of the crew's 1,200 sailors and Marines made it off the cruiser before it sank. But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said in a news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the command call the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said in a statement. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay III, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades.\n\nThe coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said. The ship's mission records and logs were lost in the wreck.\n\nResearchers got a break last year, however, when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis hours before it was sunk. The position was west of where it was presumed to be lying. The team was able to develop a new estimated position, although it still covered 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe ship is an official war grave, which means it is protected by law from disturbances. Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nHulver and Robert Neyland, the command's underwater archaeology branch head, wrote on the website that \"there remains a lot we can learn.\"\n\n\"From the sinking to the battle damage and site formation processes, we hope to gain a better understanding about the wreck site and how we can better protect USS Indianapolis to honor the service of the ship and crew.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "00:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "180884", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "302557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "score": 1}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 3}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304059", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "score": 2}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "304714", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "score": 2}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 4}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 3}, {"id": "309880", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "score": 1}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 3}, {"id": "319300", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "score": 3}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 3}, {"id": "345830", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue", "score": 2}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 3}, {"id": "352683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "score": 3}, {"id": "360672", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Little Boy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy", "score": 3}, {"id": "371178", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Neyland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Neyland", "score": 1}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "1049579", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Charles B.

It sank in 12 minutes. Some 800 of the 1,196 sailors aboard lived through the sinking, but spent days in the water, with many dying of exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. A communications breakdown had meant the ship's demise wasn't discovered until days later when floating survivors were spotted from a passing aircraft. Only 316 sailors survived.\n\nNow, wreckage of the Indianapolis has been found 18,000 feet deep in the Philippine Sea by a team led by one of America's original tech moguls, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nGet tech news in your inbox weekday mornings.

To a man, they have longed for the day when their ship would be found, solving their final mystery,\" Toti said.\n\n\"They all know this is now a war memorial, and are grateful for the respect and dignity that Paul Allen and his team have paid to one of the most tangible manifestations of the pain and sacrifice of our World War II veterans.\"\n\nOne survivor told the U.S. Navy Institute News that he was \"very happy\" the ship had been found.\n\n\"I have wished for years that they would find it.

While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nThe significant role Allen mentioned is well-known: The USS Indianapolis delivered parts of the atomic bomb the U.S. would later drop on Hiroshima, Japan, according to the History Channel. The boat and the nearly 1,200 men on board had dropped off the components for Little Boy and were on their way to Leyte Gulf when a Japanese submarine fired its torpedoes.\n\nAbout 900 men jumped into the water as the ship went under, but they weren't safe--they were injured, dehydrated and fending off sharks, according to National Geographic. They weren't discovered for days.\n\n\"All of a sudden you hear a blood-curdling scream, and you look and you see that that kapok [life] jacket goes under, and then like a fish cork that kapok life jacket brings a body back to the surface,\" survivor Edgar Harrell told the Florida Today in 2014. \"And then you see fins, fins, fins coming around all that blood.\"\n\nAllen, now a philanthropist, assembled an expedition team to look for debris using a vessel he bought in 2016. Last year, they got a break in the case when a historian used old naval log entries to determine where the USS Indianapolis was before it was torpedoed, according to USNI News.\n\nOn Friday, the team found the wreckage in the Philippine Sea -- about 18,000 feet under the surface.\n\nAs the Indianapolis Star noted, this wasn't the first time Allen's private searches have turned up historic wreckage. His dad served in World War II, and he's been interested in the conflict for a while. Two years ago, he found a Japanese battleship named the Musashi. He also discovered an Italian ship called the Artigliere.\n\nGoing forward, Allen and his team intend to continue investigating the USS Indianapolis wreckage, keeping its exact location from everyone but the Navy.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:50:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 337, "textStart": 322, "date": "2017-08-18", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "19:50:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "66684", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 2}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 2}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303727", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "score": 1}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 3}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 2}, {"id": "311491", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "score": 2}, {"id": "313171", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Florida Today"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Today", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 2}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 4}, {"id": "322486", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia Airlines"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines", "score": 3}, {"id": "334685", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cork (material)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(material)", "score": 2}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 1}, {"id": "345949", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "History (TV channel)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_(TV_channel)", "score": 2}, {"id": "357061", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ceiba pentandra"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceiba_pentandra", "score": 2}, {"id": "360672", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Little Boy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy", "score": 2}, {"id": "381126", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "score": 3}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 5}, {"id": "777479", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Leyte Gulf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leyte_Gulf", "score": 2}], "image": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/08/19/indy-2.jpg", "timeCrawl": "01:38:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "USS Indianapolis, a ship torpedoed by Japan during World War II, has finally been discovered after decades", "originalArticle": null}

Because of the secrecy surrounding the mission, the ship wasn't listed as overdue\n\nThe Indianapolis served President Roosevelt as the ship of state, and Admiral Spruance as the 5th Fleet flagship in WWII.\n\nAround 800 of the ship's 1,196 sailors and Marines survived the sinking, but after four to five days in the water, suffering exposure, dehydration, drowning, and shark attacks, only 316 survived.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "23:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "178941", "label": {"eng": "Tinian Island"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinian", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tinian Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Northern Mariana Islands"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "180884", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "235649", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 3}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 1}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 4}, {"id": "310245", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

The fate of its crew -- nearly 900 were killed, many by sharks, and just 316 survived -- was one of the Pacific war's more horrible and fascinating tales.\n\nThe expedition crew of Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, says it located the wreckage of the Indianapolis on the floor of the North Pacific Ocean, more than 18,000 feet below the surface, the U.S. Navy said in a news release Saturday.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said in the news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis, with 1,196 sailors and Marines on board, was sailing the Philippine Sea between Guam and Leyte Gulf when two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine struck just after midnight on July 30, 1945. It sank in 12 minutes, killing about 300. Survivors were left in the water, most of them with only life jackets.\n\nThere was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot the survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship's original crew alive.\n\nOver the years numerous books recounted the ship's disaster and its role in delivering key components of what would become the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian, the take-off point for the bomber Enola Gay's mission to Hiroshima in August 1945. Documentaries and movies, most recently \"USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage\" (2016) starring Nicolas Cage, have recounted the crew's horror-filled days at sea. The Indianapolis sinking also was a plot point in the Steven Spielberg blockbuster \"Jaws\" (1975), with the fictitious survivor Capt.

Allen, who led a team of civilian researchers that made the discovery.\n\nHistorians and architects from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington joined forces with Allen last year to revisit the tragedy.\n\nThe ship sank in 15 minutes on July 30, 1945, in the war's final days, and it took the Navy four days to realize that the vessel was missing.\n\nAbout 800 of the crew's 1,200 sailors and Marines made it off the cruiser before it sank. But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the command called the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay III, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades. The coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said. The ship's mission records and logs were lost in the wreck.\n\nResearchers got a break last year, however, when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis hours before it was sunk. The position was west of where it was presumed to be lying. The team was able to develop a new estimated position, although it still covered 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe ship is an official war grave, which means it is protected by law from disturbances. Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered to your inbox each morning.

About 800 of the 1197 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.\n\nAfter a Navy historian unearthed new information last year about the warship's last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1500-sq/km) patch of ocean.\n\nWith a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen's team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The Navy asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.\n\nAllen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honouring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending WWII.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" he said.\n\nThe Navy said it had plans to honour the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive, along with the families of the ship's crew.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T00:35:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "00:35:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "177", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "235649", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 3}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "303975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Website"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "score": 2}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304145", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 5}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 2}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 4}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 3}, {"id": "319300", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "score": 2}, {"id": "320592", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hypothermia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia", "score": 2}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 2}, {"id": "342575", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "score": 2}, {"id": "368513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Distress signal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal", "score": 3}, {"id": "389079", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naval History & Heritage Command"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_History_&_Heritage_Command", "score": 3}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.sbs.com.au/news/sites/sbs.com.au.news/files/styles/full/public/images/u/s/US_Shipwreck_4-3_12523652_1762477_5998d4b7a5398f3a38028da4_sd_800x600.jpg?itok=2JfTjEXn", "timeCrawl": "00:35:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Sunk US WWII warship found in Pacific", "originalArticle": null}

Allen, who led a team of civilian researchers that made the discovery.\n\nHistorians and architects from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, D.C., had joined forces with Allen last year to revisit the tragedy.\n\nThe ship sank in 15 minutes on July 30, 1945, in the war's final days, and it took the Navy four days to realize that the vessel was missing.\n\nAbout 800 of the crew's 1,200 sailors and Marines made it off the cruiser before it sank. But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said in a news release.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the command call the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said in a statement. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay III, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades.\n\nThe coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said. The ship's mission records and logs were lost in the wreck.\n\nResearchers got a break last year, however, when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis hours before it was sunk. The position was west of where it was presumed to be lying. The team was able to develop a new estimated position, although it still covered 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe ship is an official war grave, which means it is protected by law from disturbances. Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nHulver and Robert Neyland, the command's underwater archaeology branch head, wrote on the website that \"there remains a lot we can learn.\"\n\n\"From the sinking to the battle damage and site formation processes, we hope to gain a better understanding about the wreck site and how we can better protect USS Indianapolis to honor the service of the ship and crew.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:14:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "23:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "180884", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302557", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Law"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "score": 1}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 3}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 5}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304059", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "score": 2}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "304714", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "score": 2}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 4}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 3}, {"id": "309880", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "score": 1}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 3}, {"id": "319300", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "score": 3}, {"id": "340055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philippine Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Sea", "score": 3}, {"id": "345830", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue", "score": 2}, {"id": "351338", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark attack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_attack", "score": 3}, {"id": "352683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "score": 3}, {"id": "360672", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Little Boy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Boy", "score": 3}, {"id": "371178", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Neyland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Neyland", "score": 1}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "1049579", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Charles B.

It was torpedoed by an Imperial Japanese Navy submarine and sank in the last days of the war on July 30, 1945.\n\nThe vessel was found Saturday morning resting on the ocean floor, about 5,500 meters below the surface of the water. The discovery ends a 72-year mystery. Several expeditions to find the wreckage in the past have failed.\n\nBefore it sunk, the USS Indianapolis secretly delivered components for one of the two nuclear weapons that would ultimately help end the U.S. war with Japan.\n\nThe ship was hit by two torpedoes and sank during the night in about 12 minutes. The torpedoes caused an explosion that split the ship to the keel, knocking out all electric power.\n\nOf the close to 1,200 sailors and Marines on-board, about 900 made it into the water. Sharks started attacking those in the water early the next day. Around 316 survived, officials say.\n\nAllen's 16-person crew found the wreckage Saturday out of a possible 600 square miles of open ocean, Pamela Berry, a spokeswoman for a public relations group that represents Paul Allen, said.\n\nThe team is in the process of surveying the wreckage site and will be conducting a live video tour in the next few weeks, Berry said.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:51:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "20:51:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "235512", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 3}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 4}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 2}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "308000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "score": 1}, {"id": "310237", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific War"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War", "score": 2}, {"id": "312133", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Spokesperson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokesperson", "score": 1}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 4}, {"id": "318536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki", "score": 2}, {"id": "321997", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heavy cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_cruiser", "score": 3}, {"id": "322496", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Seabed"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabed", "score": 3}, {"id": "389080", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Keel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel", "score": 2}, {"id": "396657", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship commissioning"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_commissioning", "score": 3}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 4}, {"id": "918667", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarines_of_the_Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}], "image": "http://static-22.sinclairstoryline.com/resources/media/1af54617-f733-4f9d-9496-06809b7ed6a6-large16x9_Indy5.jpg", "timeCrawl": "20:51:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Billionaire Paul Allen finds USS Indianapolis wreckage in N.

Anchor and ship's bell seen here. #USSIndianapolis pic.twitter.com/Kk1YrcaeN1\n\n-- Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) August 19, 2017\n\nThe sinking of the Indianapolis in July 1945 was one of the worst naval disasters in American history.\n\nTorpedoed by a Japanese submarine after delivering atomic bomb components, the ship sank in only 12 minutes, so was unable to call for distress or deploy lifesaving equipment, according to a Navy press release.\n\nOnly 316 members of the crew survived while the other 880 sailors and Marines died either when the boat sank or after spending days in the water.\n\nSurvivors from the Indianapolis told harrowing stories about the days they spent in the water after the ship sank. Former Marine Corp. Edgar Harrell told the Indianapolis Star that many of the survivors were hurt, badly dehydrated, and that some were killed by sharks.\n\nThe story has inspired several books and movies and was the subject of a speech by Robert Shaw's character in the movie Jaws.\n\nAllen's research team found the wreckage 18,000 feet underwater in the North Pacific Ocean using a specialized submarine-like research vessel and has located several other historic ships. Allen has been called one of the world's top philanthropists for his contributions to research and conservation, according to his website.\n\nThe research team will continue to survey the site in collaboration with the Navy but the location will not be released, according to the Navy. It is being treated as a sunken war grave and the team will work with the Navy on plans to honor the families and the 22 surviving crew members.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:31:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 637, "textStart": 622, "date": "2017-08-19", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "23:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302546", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 3}, {"id": "302814", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Film"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "score": 2}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 3}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 4}, {"id": "303727", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "The Indianapolis Star"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indianapolis_Star", "score": 2}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 5}, {"id": "303975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Website"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "score": 1}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304139", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Submarine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine", "score": 3}, {"id": "304155", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Boat"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat", "score": 2}, {"id": "304420", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306055", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 2}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 4}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "310304", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313742", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "score": 1}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 2}, {"id": "322999", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Jaws (film)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)", "score": 2}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 4}, {"id": "474798", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Shaw (British actor)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shaw_(British_actor)", "score": 2}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 4}, {"id": "630640", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship's bell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship's_bell", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "23:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "USS Indianapolis wreckage found", "originalArticle": null}

While about 800 of the 1,196 crew survived the sinking, only 321 were still alive three and a half days later when a Navy seaplane on a routine patrol spotted the survivors. Finally, just 317 survived the sinking and its aftermath.\n\nIt was the US Navy's worst single at-sea loss of life.\n\nDays earlier the Indianapolis had delivered the uranium and other components to the island of Tinian for the atomic bomb that was later dropped on Hiroshima. Because the mission was secret, she had sailed alone without the usual escort of ships which would have been better able to detect and fight off Japanese submarines.\n\nThere are 19 survivors from the USS Indianapolis still alive today, and the Navy plans to honor them and families of the ship's crew.\n\nDifferent search area\n\nLast year a Navy historian researched new information about the ship's last movements which indicated a different search area.\n\nThat led a team of civilian researchers headed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to spend months searching 600 square miles (1,500 square kilometers) of ocean bed beneath the Philippine Sea. Allen announced the find on Friday via his website but did not disclose the precise location, following a request from the Navy.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said.\n\nAllen's Research Vessel Petrel is a 250-foot vessel equipped with state-of-the-art equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters. It has a 13-person crew on board.\n\nThe USS Indianapolis' commanding officer, Rear Admiral Charles B. McVay III, was court-martialed for not sailing a zigzag course to evade submarines but survivors believe he was made a scapegoat to detract from the Navy's own failings. While several SOS signals were sent before the cruiser sank, none were taken seriously and little was done when the ship failed to arrive at its destination on time. McVay committed suicide in 1968.

Allen, who led a team of civilian researchers that made the discovery.\n\nHistorians and architects from the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington joined forces with Allen last year to revisit the tragedy.\n\nThe ship sank in 15 minutes on July 30, 1945, in the war's final days, and it took the Navy four days to realize that the vessel was missing.\n\nAbout 800 of the crew's 1,200 sailors and Marines made it off the cruiser before it sank. But almost 600 of them died over the next four to five days from exposure, dehydration, drowning and shark attacks. Nineteen crew members are alive today, the Navy command said.\n\nThe Indianapolis had just completed a top secret mission to deliver components of the atomic bomb \"Little Boy\" to the island of Tinian. The bomb was later dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the command called the shipwreck a \"significant discovery,\" considering the depth of the water.\n\n\"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" Allen said. His research vessel, Petrel, has state-of-the-art subsea equipment that can descend to depths like those at which the ship was found.\n\nThe cruiser's captain, Charles Butler McVay III, was among those who survived, but he was eventually court-martialed and convicted of losing control of the vessel. About 350 Navy ships were lost in combat during the war, but he was the only captain to be court-martialed. Years later, under pressure from survivors to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by Congress and President Clinton.\n\nThe shipwreck's location had eluded researchers for decades. The coordinates keyed out in an S.O.S. signal were forgotten by surviving radio operators and were not received by Navy ships or shore stations, the Navy command said. The ship's mission records and logs were lost in the wreck.\n\nResearchers got a break last year, however, when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis hours before it was sunk. The position was west of where it was presumed to be lying. The team was able to develop a new estimated position, although it still covered 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe ship is an official war grave, which means it is protected by law from disturbances. Naval archaeologists will prepare to tour the site and see what data they can retrieve. No recovery efforts are planned.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine? Our daily headlines email is delivered each morning.

Credit: US Navy\n\nAccording to a statement from the Navy, two Japanese submarine torpedoes struck the ship, sinking it more than 5500m below the surface of the Pacific Ocean in the closing stages of World War 2.\n\nWe've located wreckage of USS Indianapolis in Philippine Sea at 5500m below the sea.

Though about 800 of its 1196 sailors and Marines survived the initial sinking, following four days of floating in shark-infested waters with few supplies or protection from the elements, just 316 made it back home. It had just finished delivering components to the atomic bomb later detonated in Hiroshima.\n\nPhilanthrophist Paul G. Allen led the 13-person search team, which relied on estimates from Naval History and Heritage Command's Dr. Richard Hulver to narrow the search perimeter to approximately 1550km\u00b2 The team was able to locate the Indianapolis using \"state-of-the-art subsea equipment capable of diving to 6000m\" deployed off the Research Vessel Petrel and is still in the process of surveying and mapping the site.\n\n\"The Petrel and its capabilities, the technology it has and the research we've done, are the culmination years of dedication and hard work,\" Allen's director of subsea operations Robert Kraft told the Navy. \"We've assembled and integrated this technology, assets and unique capability into operating platform, which is now one amongst very few on the planet.\"\n\nPhotos of the craft show parts of it are extraordinarily well preserved. At over 5500m down in the ocean, it also comes close to matching world records for deepest known wreck, which is currently held by the World War II-era German blockade runner SS Rio Grande at 5760m.\n\n#RVPetrel's search for #USSIndianapolis continues -- more info and pictures to come: https://t.co/8nNBj1iaO4 pic.twitter.com/bzD86dSX57\n\n-- Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) August 19, 2017\n\nImportant chapter of WWII history concludes -- I hope survivors/families gain some closure. Anchor and ship's bell seen here. #USSIndianapolis pic.twitter.com/Kk1YrcaeN1\n\n-- Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) August 19, 2017\n\nAccording to the Navy, Allen's team is complying with the standard practice of treating the site as a war grave and not physically disturbing it -- which will respect the wishes of the 22 surviving crew members and the lost men's families.\n\n[Naval History and

It is being treated as a sunken war grave and the team will work with the Navy on plans to honor the families and the 22 surviving crew members.\n\nOf the 1,197 men aboard the Indianapolis, only 317 survived after spending five days adrift in shark-infested waters.\n\n\"Even in the worst defeats and disasters there is valor and sacrifice that deserves to never be forgotten\", Sam Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a statement, USA Today reported.\n\n'They can serve as inspiration to current and future Sailors enduring situations of mortal peril.\n\nThe 250-foot research vessel Petrel which carried out the search was recently retrofitted with state-of-the-art subsea equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters. \"We've assembled and integrated this technology, assets and unique capability into an operating platform which is now one among very few on the planet\".\n\nThis narrowed the search to an area west of the original presumed position but still encompassing 600 square miles of open ocean.\n\nThe USS Indianapolis (CA-35) was a 9,800-ton Portland Class heavy cruiser that operated in the Atlantic and Pacific, and earned 10 battle stars during WWII.\n\nThe ship, which garnered new prominence in 1972 thanks to a chilling speech in blockbuster movie 'Jaws, ' had been the subject of several searches before Allen's 16-person expedition found its final resting place.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T20:50:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time":

At over 18,000 feet down in the ocean, it also comes close to matching world records for deepest known wreck, which is currently held by the World War II-era German blockade runner SS Rio Grande at 18,900 feet.\n\nAccording to the Navy, Allen's team is complying with the standard practice of treating the site as a war grave and not physically disturbing it-which will respect the wishes of the 22 surviving crew members and the lost men's families.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T23:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "23:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "66684", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 3}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 1}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 4}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Research vessel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_vessel", "score": 2}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "321088", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Surveying"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying", "score": 2}, {"id": "321490", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "score": 3}, {"id": "329606", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 1}, {"id": "341376", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mariana Trench"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench", "score": 1}, {"id": "368513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Distress signal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal", "score": 3}, {"id": "379306", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Subsea (technology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsea_(technology)", "score": 3}, {"id": "381126", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "score": 2}, {"id": "386404", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Army"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Army", "score": 4}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 4}, {"id": "702431", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Blockade runner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_runner", "score": 1}], "image": "http://www.gizmodo.in/photo/60139357/news/civilian-team-finds-wreck-of-uss-indianopolis-lost-in-1945-with-880-crew.jpg?41244", "timeCrawl": "23:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Civilian Team Finds Wreck of USS Indianopolis, Lost in 1945 With 880 Crew", "originalArticle": null}

Around 315 crew members survived in the ocean for several days, suffering from starvation, dehydration and shark attacks -- a dramatic story memorialized in a harrowing monologue from the movie \"Jaws.\"\n\nPaul Taylor, a civilian spokesman for the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command, said that monologue was slightly hyperbolic.\n\n\"It's not like all those healthy people went into the water -- their ship had been blown out from beneath them. They suffered mightily and began to die, and most people agree that the overwhelming number of shark attacks were on dead or dying bodies.\"\n\nPeople have been looking for the USS Indianapolis for years, but a recent paper by naval historian Richard Hulver guided the Vulcan team toward its location.\n\nTaylor said Hulver \"came across, of all things, a blog post for a fudge shop in Michigan.\"\n\nThat post was about a descendant of a veteran who had been on a tank landing ship that spotted the USS Indianapolis just before it sank.\n\nTaylor said the Navy takes sunken ships seriously -- as a sacred gravesite for dead sailors, a repository for state secrets that may have been locked up in some safe in a captain's quarters and as U.S. military property that may include unexploded ordinance or other public-safety hazards.\n\n\"It's a tragedy that only 316-317 sailors survived,\" he said.\n\n\"But it's the strength of the unit that brought them through.

The 9,800 ton heavy cruiser was the flagship of the Fifth Fleet and completed a secret mission to deliver parts of the first atomic bomb used in warfare. It was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945 while en route from Guam to Leyte. Only 316 of the 1,196 sailors and Marines survived; 22 still live today.\n\nAfter several expeditions to try and locate the Indianapolis, Allen's 16-person team was successful thanks to two important factors. The first was a 250-foot research vessel that Allen bought last year and retrofitted with state-of-the-art subsea equipment, including a remote-controlled vehicle with attached HD cameras capable of diving 6,000 meters. The second was a discovery last year by historian Dr. Richard Hulver, who found a new potential search area.\n\nSee more photos of the wreckage here:\n\nAn image shot from a remotely operated underwater vehicle shows a spare parts box from USS Indianapolis on the floor of the Pacific Ocean in more than 16,000 feet of water. Photo courtesy of Paul G. Allen. An image shot from a remotely operated vehicle shows what appears to be the painted hull number \"35.\" Based on the curvature of the hull section, this seems to be the port side of the ship. Photo courtesy of Paul G. Allen. An image shot from a remotely operated vehicle shows wreckage which appears to be one of the two anchor windlass mechanisms from the forecastle of the ship. Photo courtesy of Paul G. Allen.\n\n\"To be able to honor the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role during World War II is truly humbling,\" Allen said in a statement. \"As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances. While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming.\"\n\nAllen's crew will live stream a video tour of the wreckage in the coming weeks, similar to what they did for the Japanese battleship Musashi, which Allen helped discover in 2015. The 64-year-old also led a mission to find the Italian World War II destroyer Artigliere this past March.\n\nHere are photos of the vessel and remote-controlled vehicle; photos via Vulcan (Allen's investment arm):\n\nHere's how the subsea survey process works, via Vulcan:\n\nThe AUV deployed with pre-programed search parameters for up to 20 hrs. This search / survey technique commonly referred to as mowing the lawn. Once a search grid is complete, the AUV returns to a pre-programmed location where it is retrieved and the team downloads its data. While reviewing the data, the team looks for anomalies that indicate man-made objects or features that appear abstract to the surrounding geology. Then the targets or features of interest are subsequently explored with the ROV for positive identification. The ROV descends and ascends at 35 meters per minute, depending on depth; it can take up to three hours for the ROV to reach its target.

Though about 800 of its 1,196 sailors and Marines survived the initial sinking, following four days of floating in shark-infested waters with few supplies or protection from the elements, just 316 made it back home. It had just finished delivering components to the atomic bomb later detonated in Hiroshima.\n\nPhilanthrophist Paul G. Allen led the 13-person search team, which relied on estimates from Naval History and Heritage Command's Dr. Richard Hulver to narrow the search perimeter to approximately 600 square miles (1550 square kilometers). The team was able to locate the Indianapolis using \"state-of-the-art subsea equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters\" deployed off the 250-foot Research Vessel Petrel, and is still in the process of surveying and mapping the site.\n\n\"The Petrel and its capabilities, the technology it has and the research we've done, are the culmination years of dedication and hard work,\" Allen's director of subsea operations Robert Kraft told the Navy. \"We've assembled and integrated this technology, assets and unique capability into operating platform, which is now one amongst very few on the planet.\"\n\nPhotos of the craft show parts of it are extraordinarily well preserved. At over 18,000 feet down in the ocean, it also comes close to matching world records for deepest known wreck, which is currently held by the World War II-era German blockade runner SS Rio Grande at 18,900 feet.\n\nAccording to the Navy, Allen's team is complying with the standard practice of treating the site as a war grave and not physically disturbing it -- which will respect the wishes of the 22 surviving crew members and the lost men's families.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:24:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.545098066329956, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374564", "time": "22:24:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374564", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "66684", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hiroshima-shi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "185646", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "303483", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "score": 3}, {"id": "303600", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "score": 3}, {"id": "303819", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "score": 3}, {"id": "304136", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Torpedo"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo", "score": 3}, {"id": "304957", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "score": 3}, {"id": "306725", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "score": 3}, {"id": "307334", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian", "score": 4}, {"id": "310233", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "score": 5}, {"id": "310236", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Imperial Japanese Navy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Japanese_Navy", "score": 3}, {"id": "310242", "label": {"eng": "Empire of Japan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "313955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "score": 3}, {"id": "317317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cruiser"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiser", "score": 5}, {"id": "321490", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "score": 3}, {"id": "368513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Distress signal"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_signal", "score": 3}, {"id": "379306", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Subsea (technology)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsea_(technology)", "score": 3}, {"id": "381126", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Robert Kraft"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kraft", "score": 2}, {"id": "389079", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Naval History & Heritage Command"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_History_&_Heritage_Command", "score": 3}, {"id": "398236", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Paul Allen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen", "score": 3}, {"id": "526551", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "USS Indianapolis (CA-35)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)", "score": 4}, {"id": "702431", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Blockade runner"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_runner", "score": 1}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s---Aguk-hC--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_450,q_80,w_800/zl33ualjusezvd0m2ujx.jpg", "timeCrawl": "22:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Civilian Team Finds Wreck of USS Indianapolis, Lost in 1945 With 880 Crew", "originalArticle": null}

Allen announced the discovery of World War II-era heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis (CA 35). Here's what you need to know about this significant historical discovery.\n\nThe Indianapolis was returning from a secret mission at the time of its sinking in 1945. After being repaired and refitted after participating in the United States Navy's island-hopping campaign against Imperial Japan in the Pacific, the Indy ferried enriched uranium and other parts later incorporated into the \"Little Boy\" atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in early August.\n\nWithin hours of history's first successful nuclear bomb test at the Trinity site in New Mexico, the Indy left San Francisco on July 16 en route to Tinian Island. Indy's mission was as urgent as it was secret, underscored by the fact that she made the trip from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor in 74-1/2 hours, which is a speed record that stands to this day.\n\nAfter having successfully delivered her cargo on July 26, the Navy ordered the Indy from Guam to Leyte in the Philippines to join a task force and continue the campaign. However, in the early hours of July 30, two days after setting sail the cruiser came under attack from a Japanese submarine, which fired two torpedoes at the ship, ultimately sinking her.\n\nAt the time, the Navy's practice was to assume that ships the size of the Indianapolis would arrive to their destinations on time unless information was received that suggested otherwise. Despite radio calls sent by the Indy, she was not missed by the Navy until over three days later, as such information was never relayed to naval leadership.\n\nThough the Navy denied it at the time, three radio operators received messages from the rapidly-sinking ship, but the signals were sent in vain - one commander was too intoxicated at the time to act, another commander ordered his sailors not to disturb him, and a third suspected the signals were a ruse by the Japanese.\n\nIt was not until a routine patrol flight noticed men in the water on August 2 that a rescue operation was mounted.\n\nThe story of the Indianapolis was etched into popular culture by the 1975 Steven Spielberg thriller Jaws. Though John Milius consulted with survivors when crafting Quint's monologue, several inaccuracies crept into the lines spoken by Robert Shaw.\n\nQuint tells the enraptured Brody and Hooper that 1,100 sailors entered the waters after Indy's twelve-minute sinking, with only 316 who \"come out.\" However, nearly one quarter of the ship's 1,269 officers and men went down with the ship, leaving around 900 to brave conditions on the surface. Of these, 321 survivors were pulled from the waves and 317 ultimately returned alive.\n\nIn addition, Quint claims that the Navy's failure to timely respond to the sinking was a result of the secret nature of their mission and the fact that radio operators sent no distress calls as a result. While survivors of the Indy's sinking may have believed that at the time, records subsequently declassified by the Navy revealed the opposite, as discussed above.\n\nQuint closes his speech by telling the speechless pair that the sinking occurred on June 29. Though the ship was in fact injured on that date, she was wounded by a bomb dropped on her by a Japanese plane during fighting off the shore of Okinawa on March 31, laying her up for substantial repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California until early July.\n\nThe Indy sank just over 72 years ago and, as a result, only a few of the survivors of the sinking are still alive. According to the Navy's news release, 22 men lived to see the Indy's rediscovery. Though the Navy will not release the exact location of the wreck due to the fact that it remains the final resting place for some 300 sailors, the service says that it has plans to honor those still living as well as those who have passed away upon the ship's rediscovery.\n\nImportant chapter of WWII history concludes-I hope survivors/families gain some closure. Anchor and ship's bell seen here. #USSIndianapolis pic.twitter.com/Kk1YrcaeN1\n\n-- Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) August 19, 2017\n\nIncluded in the honored dead will be the ship's final captain, Rear Admiral Charles B. McVay III. Despite the fact that some 380 ships were sunk by enemy action over the course of the war, McVay was the only ship's captain to be court martialed for losing his ship. McVay was ultimately held responsible for the sinking, even in the face of testimony by the Japanese submarine commander who fired upon the Indy that there was little McVay could have done to avoid the ship's ultimate fate.\n\nHounded both by the painful weight of blame for the ship's loss and exacerbated by angry phone calls and letters from families of sailors who died under his command, McVay took his own life in 1968. He was officially exonerated by the Navy in 2001.\n\n[Featured Image by By US Navy via Wikimedia Commons]", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T02:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 737, "textStart": 730,

Courtesy Bureau of Ships Collection in the U.S. National Archives/U.S. Navy/Handout via REUTERS\n\nResearchers have found the wreckage of the U.S. warship Indianapolis, which was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the final days of World War Two, more than 18,000 feet (5.5 kilometers) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, the Navy said on Saturday.\n\nThe cruiser was returning from its mission to deliver components for the atomic bomb that would soon be dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima when it was fired upon in the North Pacific Ocean by a Japanese submarine on July 30, 1945.\n\nIt sunk in 12 minutes, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington. No distress signal was sent. About 800 of the 1,196 crew members aboard survived the sinking, but only 316 were rescued alive five days later, with the rest lost to exposure, dehydration, drowning and sharks.\n\nAfter a Navy historian unearthed new information in 2016 about the warship's last movements that pointed to a new search area, a team of civilian researchers led by Paul Allen, a Microsoft Corp co-founder, spent months searching in a 600-square-mile (1,500-square-kilometer) patch of ocean.\n\nWith a vessel rigged with equipment that can reach some of the deepest ocean floors, members of Allen's team found the wreckage somewhere in the Philippine Sea on Friday, Allen said in a statement on his website. The statement said the Navy had asked Allen to keep the precise location confidential.\n\nAllen said that the discovery was a humbling experience and a means of honoring sailors he saw as playing a vital role in ending World War Two. \"While our search for the rest of the wreckage will continue, I hope everyone connected to this historic ship will feel some measure of closure at this discovery so long in coming,\" he said.\n\nIdentification was easier than in some deep-sea expeditions: some of the exposed wreck was clearly marked with Indianapolis signage, according to photographs shared by Allen and the Navy.\n\n\"It is exceedingly rare you find the name of the ship on a piece of the wreckage,\" Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the Naval History and Heritage Command, said in a telephone interview. \"If that's not Indianapolis then I don't know what is.\"\n\nThe Navy said it had plans to honor the 22 survivors from the Indianapolis still alive along with the families of the ship's crew.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Allen;

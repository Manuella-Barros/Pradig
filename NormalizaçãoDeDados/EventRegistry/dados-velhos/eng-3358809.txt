transport of all poultry products from within seven kilometres of the infected farms, Pinol said.\n\nHe said the authorities suspect the virus could have been spread by migratory birds or from smuggled poultry products.\n\nSan Luis, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Manila, is close to the Candaba swamps, a major way station and destination for migratory birds who move out of the Asian mainland during winter.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "timeCrawl": "10:44:00", "sim": 0.9960784316062927,

Philippines today warned citizens not to kill or poach migratory birds that usually fly in from China, the possible source of a virus that triggered the Southeast Asian nation's first outbreak of avian flu, to avoid worsening the situation.\n\nThere has been no case of human transmission but the virus prompted a cull of 200,000 fowl last week after it was detected on a farm in the province of Pampanga, north of the capital Manila, and spread to five neighbouring farms.\n\nMigratory birds or smuggled ducks from China may have brought in the virus, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol has said.\n\nThe bird migration season in the Philippines usually starts around September, with the birds returning to their breeding grounds the following March, Mundita Lim, director of the Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB), said in an advisory.\n\n\"The culling, poisoning or chasing of migratory birds is strongly discouraged as they have proven ineffective and counterproductive,\" she added.\n\nSick or dead wild birds should immediately be reported to the Department of Agriculture to allow checks for the virus, Lim said, urging breeders in areas frequented by migratory birds to guard their flocks against contact with them.\n\nEarly tests of the virus in the avian flu outbreak ruled out the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, but Philippine officials have sought further testing by an Australian animal health laboratory that is part of a global network combating the disease.\n\nThe Philippines is monitoring the quality and prices of poultry products in its markets, but believes farm authorities have managed to isolate and contain the virus, the presidential palace said in a statement.\n\nRoy Cimatu, the secretary of environment and natural resources, said his department would step up surveillance against efforts to smuggle wild birds by sea and air. -- Reuters", "timeCrawl": "08:55:00", "sim": 0.9529411792755127, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 121, "date":

quails and ducks after confirming the country's first outbreak of bird flu, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said on Friday.\n\nThe avian flu outbreak was detected in a farm in San Luis municipality in Pampanga province, north of the capital Manila, which later spread to five neighboring farms. There has been no case of human transmission although health officials are conducting checks on farm workers.\n\n\"We have declared a 1-km (0.6 mile) quarantine radius with the epicenter being San Luis. All fowls found within the area will be culled and buried, and the estimated population is 200,000,\" Pinol told reporters at a news conference.\n\n\"That would include every bird, every duck, every quail, every poultry within the vicinity of the quarantine area.\"\n\nThe volume of birds to be culled was half of Pinol's initial estimate of 400,000, which he said was based on a preliminary evaluation and was later revised after inspection.\n\nInitial tests ruled out the highly pathogenic H5N1 as the virus strain, Dr. Celia Carlos told reporters, and samples will be sent to Australia for further testing.\n\n\"The Department of Health is doing surveillance of possible human cases especially concentrating on people who have been exposed to the affected animals or poultry,\" Carlos said.\n\nCulling should be completed within the next three days, said Pinol. The virus may have come from migratory birds from China or smuggled ducks, also from China, he said.\n\nThere were indications as early as April of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July, with around 37,000 birds dying during the period, Pinol said.\n\nHe said he had informed President Rodrigo Duterte of the outbreak and a report would be submitted to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.\n\nThe Philippines is the latest country in Asia, Europe and Africa where the bird flu viruses have spread in recent months. Many strains only infect birds, but the H7N9 strain has led to human cases, including fatalities, in China.\n\n(Reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr. and Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Richard Pullin and Jacqueline Wong)", "timeCrawl": "11:06:00", "sim": 0.8392156958580017, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8597974", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "id": 1164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "id": 1165, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

outbreak affected six poultry farms in San Luis town.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said he was informed Thursday that 37,000 birds have died from avian influenza subtype H5 in what has been declared as the first bird flu outbreak in the country.\n\nHe has ordered the slaughter of at least 200,000 fowls, saying the number of birds that will have to be killed could reach 500,000.\n\nA quarantine area was declared within one kilometer of the affected poultry farms in San Luis. Transport of fowls and eggs from a controlled area within a seven-kilometer radius of the affected farms will not be allowed.\n\n\"All fowls found within the quarantine area will be culled and buried,\" he said.\n\nIn an emergency forum with Pampanga officials at a popular chicken restaurant, Pi\u00f1ol said the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and the University of the Philippines at Los Ba\u00f1os confirmed after tests that the H5 strain of the virus was discovered at a farm in Barangay San Agustin in San Luis town after its owner reported that several chickens, quails and ducks had suddenly died.\n\nAccording to a BAI report, infection may have started as early as May, but poultry operators were reluctant to report the incident.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said he already informed President Rodrigo Duterte and Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial of the outbreak.\n\nHe stressed that the Department of Agriculture (DA) is ready to assist poultry owners and farmers once the estimated 200,000 caged fowls including stray fowls and fighting cocks in the town will be exterminated.\n\n\"We really have to exterminate the fowls because we don't want the disease to spread. I already ordered our quarantine department to set up quarantine stations in the area. Alam namin na pag pinatay naming iyung mga manok niyo, mawawalan kayo ng hanap buhay. In the meantime, ano po ang inyong pwedeng gawin? Pag usapan natin iyan kung kailangan niyo ng tulong, financing, at ano pang tulong mula sa DA,\" he said.\n\nThe secretary also assured officials and the public that the DA was able to confine the virus in the area.\n\nCurrently, the avian flu virus is not yet highly pathogenic or deadly, as there are still no reported cases of poultry-to-human contamination, although the World Health Organization said that human infection is primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals.\n\nThe WHO also clarified that there is no evidence that the avian flu can be acquired by eating properly cooked eggs or poultry.\n\nUbial, for her part, said in a statement that the public should take precautionary measures against the flu.\n\n\"Do not go near wild birds or go to farms with fowls! If you have flu symptoms that last longer than three days or feel very weak, see a doctor or go to nearest hospital for testing if its bird flu!\" she said.\n\nThe infection may cause diseases such as mild conjunctivitis or swelling of the eyes, severe pneumonia and even death. Interaction with humans infected with the flu, however, does not result in \"efficient transmission\" between people.\n\nStill, a directive banning the shipment of fowls from Luzon to other parts of the country should also be issued, Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nHe said the DA is looking at two possible causes of the avian flu: migratory birds in Candaba swamp in Pampanga; or smuggling of Peking duck from China through Subic, Zambales which is near Pampanga.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said they were looking for other sources of chicks and hatching eggs outside Luzon, as a possible fowl shortage looms.\n\nHe said the DA is looking at Mindanao where there is focus on increased poultry production to meet the strong fowl demand in December.

to other parts of the country after an avian flu outbreak in Pampanga.\n\nIn a post on his Facebook page, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol said, however, that the order does not apply to imports of chicks, hatching eggs and other fowl, which can still be shipped with \"stringent quarantine protocols.\"\n\n\"This means that chicken brought in from the United States intended for shipment to the Visayas or Mindanao may not be taken out of the boxes and must be loaded directly into the connecting flights,\" Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nAt least 200,000 birds, chicken, ducks, quails, pigeons and fighting roosters in areas affected by the outbreak in Pampanga are already being gathered for slaughter, he said, adding that the owners of these will be compensated at P80 a head.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said the Health department has confirmed that the strain that has infected 37,000 fowl, mostly chickens, in San Luis town in Pampanga was Type A Sub-Type H5, which does not affect humans.\n\nWorkers and residents of the town have not shown any signs of illness since the outbreak in April, he said.\n\nThe Bureau of Animal Industry has declared a one-kilometer radius quarantine zone around the farms where the outbreak was confirmed.\n\nThere is also an existing seven-kilometer radius \"controlled zone\" in Pampanga, where no fowl, eggs or other products can be brought out.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said that at least 100 quarantine officers have been deployed within the controlled zone.\n\nAll vehicles coming out of the area will be sprayed with disinfectants to ensure the containment of the virus, he said.\n\nIn 21 days, the department will deploy \"sentinel birds\" in the affected farms to determine if the virus is still present. Quarantine restrictions will be lifted after 90 days if the sentinel birds show no sign of infection.\n\n\"This is the first time that the country has recorded the presence of the bird flu virus and I am calling on all Filipinos to please help [the] government contain this crisis by cleaning up their farms and closely monitoring their chicken for any signs of disease,\" he said.\n\nThe Palace said the government is monitoring the situation closely.\n\n\"We are closely watching the quality and the price of poultry products in the markets as the Department of Agriculture [DA] announced the culling of thousands of chicken in Pampanga,\" said Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella.\n\n\"We believe DA has acted fast on the issue and has managed to isolate and contain the virus,\" Abella said.\n\n\"Concerned government agencies are now looking at businesses that might take advantage of the situation and are monitoring the price of raw and processed chicken meat in the markets,\" Abella said.\n\n\"While we assure the public that there would be no price increase in chicken meat as there is only one area affected by the avian flu, we must see to it that uncontaminated meat is sold in the markets,\" Abella added.\n\nAbella said there has been no report of bird-to-human contamination in the first outbreak of bird flu in the country, which was disclosed by Pi\u00f1ol on Friday.\n\n\"We ask our people to remain calm yet vigilant. Any person living or residing in affected areas or who had been exposed to dead chickens who becomes sick with flu or flu-like illness, such as fever and/or sore throat/cough should immediately report to their local health center or nearest hospital for laboratory test,\" Abella said.\n\nHe noted that the Health department said bird flu is transferred through respiratory routes and \"properly cooked chicken meat and eggs remain safe to eat.\"\n\nHealth Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said proper hygiene, especially hand washing, and careful food preparation were the first line of defense against infection.\n\nTayag also urged anyone who becomes sick after handling chicken meat to immediately go to a hospital to get tested.\n\nA state of calamity has been declared in Pampanga.\n\nSenator Francis Pangilinan in a statement said the Agriculture and Health departments should launch a massive public information campaign about the virus to prevent its spread.\n\nThe DA said as many as 131,500 chickens, quails and ducks from poultry farms in the villages of San Carlos and Sta. Rita would be destroyed.\n\nPoultry farm owner Linda Sumat wept as she watched. She said the outbreak meant huge financial losses because even egg layers that showed no symptoms of avian flu would also be culled.\n\nEvery bird within a kilometer quarantine zone set up by the government was marked for destruction by the DA.\n\nSumat said she hoped the government would fulfill its promise to pay for the culled fowls but said the P80 price per head was low.\n\nThe DA was expected to set aside at least P1.6 million of its budget to compensate the farmers for the birds that will be culled. The amount is apart from a loan package that Pi\u00f1ol had committed to the farmers in the region.\n\nSome three million to five million layers of Minalin and the nearby town of Sto. Tomas -- the egg basket of the Philippines -- remain safe from bird flu because they have been vaccinated, said Beth Pineda, owner of U.B. Farm, one of the biggest poultry raisers in Pampanga with 400,000 layers.\n\nMinalin, a fourth class municipality and the nearby town Sto. Tomas are called the country's egg basket because they produce about three-million eggs a day.\n\nPoultry raisers in Minalin believe the the first bird flu that visited the country originated from quails, and ducks while government said that it came from migratory birds from the Candaba swamps and peking duck imported from China.

As of this time, there has been no report of bird-to-human contamination,\" Abella said.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol on Friday said around 400,000 fowls in San Luis town in Pampanga will be culled and buried. \"We have declared a one-kilometer quarantine radius with the epicenter being in San Luis.\"\n\nPi\u00f1ol said that the outbreak of avian influenza Type-A, subtype H4 began in a quail farm before the virus spread to poultry farms in Barangay San Agustin in San Luis town. Some 37,000 birds have already died from the virus, and a number of farms have reported a mortality rate of as high as 100 percent.\n\nSen. Francis Escudero said the Department of Agriculture \"must act very fast to contain it and to disseminate accurate and updated information to the public in order to avoid contamination and panic.\"\n\n\"The DoH is assisting the DA for avian flu investigation and containment activities, which include flu vaccinations and protective equipment for poultry handlers and responders,\" Abella said.\n\nHe added that heightened surveillance for flu-like syndromes is now being instituted in Pampanga within a seven-kilometer radius of the affected poultry farms.\n\nAbella called on residents near the affected areas saying: \"We ask our people to remain calm yet vigilant. Any person living or residing in affected areas or who had been exposed to dead chickens who becomes sick with flu or flu-like illness, such as fever and/or sore throat/cough should immediately report to their local health center or nearest hospital for laboratory test.\"\n\n\"Also, the DOH assures our people that avian flu is transferred via respiratory routes. Properly cooked chicken meat and eggs remain safe to eat,\" he added.\n\nWatch out for profiteers\n\nMeanwhile, Pangilinan said, \"With the DA's announcement of culling hundreds of thousands of fowls, we urge the Department of Trade and Industry to watch out for profiteers who might take advantage of the situation and increase the prices of raw chicken meat and processed food in the market.\"\n\nHe said the DA and the DoH should conduct a massive information campaign such as community assemblies to educate the public about the virus, its dangers, and on ways of avoiding it.\n\n\"What is the H5 avian flu strain? How is it different from the much-dreaded A(H1N1) bird flu that spread elsewhere around the world in 2009?\" Pangilinan asked.\n\nThe information drive should include the protocols to be followed to prevent the further spread of the virus, he said.\n\n\"Since the virus is known to infect humans as well, people, especially those who handle fowls, should know how to protect themselves,\" Pangilinan said.\n\nThe DA should also ensure that only uncontaminated meat is available to the consuming public at standard prices.\n\n\"As it is, there is only one affected area and there are many other sources of chicken meat in the country,\" Pangilinan said.\n\nHe lauded the national government's commitment to compensate poultry farmers for every culled bird.\n\n\"But more than this, we push for greater government support for the micro and small businesses and the industry in general through funding and other assistance as they battle the virus and recover from their loses,\" he said.\n\n\"Experts have repeatedly warned that the avian flu pandemic is inevitable, even as the timing is unpredictable.

the country's first outbreak of bird flu in Pampanga, where the declaration of a state of calamity looms, authorities said Friday.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Emmanuel revealed that the avian flu outbreak was detected in Barangay San Agustin, this town, and later spread to neighboring farms.\n\nThis prompted Governor Lilia Pineda to declare a state of calamity in the province Friday although Pi\u00f1ol said there has been no case of human transmission so far.\n\n\"We will cull all 400,000 birds within a 1-km (0.6 mile) area. We don't want diseases to spread,\" Pinol said.\n\nThe source of the disease and the strain of avian flu were not immediately clear.\n\nCiting initial reports, Pi\u00f1ol said that the first outbreak of sub-type H5 virus began in a quail farm, \"killing 50 of 70 ducks, wiping out all the quails, and spreading in the poultry farms.\"\n\nClose to 40,000 poultry heads, including quail and ducks, have already been slaughtered in the farming village where the highly infectious strain of bird flu was detected.\n\nThere were indications as early as April of bird flu hitting one farm, but the situation worsened in July, Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nHe said he has informed President Duterte of the outbreak and a report will be submitted to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.\n\nCurrently, Pi\u00f1ol said they are still trying to figure out where the virus came although he noted that the possible carriers could be the migratory birds and the smuggling of Peking duck from China that were possibly coursed through Subic.\n\nCase in point, the Philippines is no longer free of the avian influenza that has spread rapidly across Asia over the past years despite DA's efforts to implement very strict measures to prevent its entry.\n\nTo minimize transfer of the dreaded poultry virus outside the affected area, the DA also banned the shipment of fowls from Luzon to the other parts of the country.\n\nDr. Andrew B. Villacorta, DA Region 3 regional executive director, said that agencies concerned are presently discussing possible action should the situation worsened and affect the whole poultry industry.\n\nLast year, 52, 000 heads of 45 days (broiler chicken), 140, 801 game fowls (fighting cocks) and another 140, 000 native or free range chickens were also slaughtered in 82 towns in Central Luzon's seven provinces, which includes Pampanga, after they were hit by another highly", "timeCrawl": "13:23:00", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8623455", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "id": 222, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "id": 1164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "id": 1212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

bird flu in San Luis, Pampanga.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol said 38,000 poultry heads had died following the outbreak in six farms. The provincial government immediately declared Pampanga under a state of calamity.\n\nThere has been no case of human transmission so far, Pi\u00f1ol told reporters yesterday on the sidelines of the Luzon Mango Stakeholders Forum in Lingayen, Pangasinan.\n\nBut Pi\u00f1ol said they had to cull 400,000 poultry heads within a one-kilometer area because \"we don't want diseases to spread.\"\n\nPi\u00f1ol reported that test specimens confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) sub-type H5 in the farms in Barangay San Agustin in San Luis. This type of virus is virulent and causes 80 to 100 percent mortality in the poultry industry, he said.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said there were indications of the virus outbreak as early as April \"but the commercial poultry operators did not report it immediately.\"\n\n\"Then the situation worsened around July,\" Pi\u00f1ol told reporters.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said quarantine teams are now guarding the exits of San Luis to disinfect all vehicles leaving the area.\n\nThe DA targets to finish culling the animals in the next three days and the government said it will compensate affected farm owners.\n\n\"I don't care if we have to kill a million, including those free range and stray fowls. What is that compared to the whole poultry industry?\" he added.\n\nA majority of the affected poultry heads are layered chickens that produce table eggs and products of farms being delivered within Pampanga only, which lessens the threat of bird flu spreading in other areas, particularly in Metro Manila.\n\nThe agriculture chief assured consumers that there has been no reported spread of the virus to Pampanga's neighboring provinces.\n\nDA-attached agency Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) is now in the process of sending samples to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, a World Organization for Animal Health reference laboratory for further testing.\n\nWhile virus transmission from animals to humans is low, the Department of Health (DOH) advised the public to immediately report residents who might show symptoms of flu.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said initial reports showed the first outbreak started in a certain quail farm, killing around 50 of 70 ducks, wiping out all the quail and eventually spreading to other poultry farms.\n\nAccording to Pi\u00f1ol, DA and BAI are still tracing the possible source and carrier of the virus.\n\n\"We have two possible sources. First is the migratory birds and second is the ongoing smuggling of Peking duck from China, possibly coursed through the Subic area,\" he said.\n\nApart from confining the area, the department has ordered the ban of the shipment of fowl from Luzon.\n\n\"The good thing about the situation is that we are an archipelagic country. If there's an outbreak in Luzon, we can still prevent it from spreading in the Visayas and Mindanao,\" Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nFurthermore, the DA is now discussing its next course of action should there be a shortage in processed poultry products due to the outbreak of the virus, particularly as the Christmas season nears.\n\n\"It will obviously affect the food chain, especially we are nearing the - ber months. We have to increase the production of poultry and poultry products in Mindanao,\" Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\n\"We will have to find other sources for chicks and hatching eggs because the majority really comes from Luzon,\" he added.\n\nHealth Secretary Paulyn Ubial urged the public to take precautions amid the outbreak.\n\nAccording to Ubial, people \"should cover their mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing, wash their hands often, take plenty of water and juices and have enough rest and sleep.\"\n\n\"Do not go near wild birds or go to farms with fowls. If you have flu symptoms that last longer than three days or feel very weak, see a doctor or go to nearest hospital for testing if it is bird flu,\" Ubial said in a text message.\n\n\"Major epidemics of bird flu in the US have not documented any crossover to humans. However, in Vietnam and Hong Kong, a case of human had been identified and died,\" she added.\n\nUbial gave assurance that \"cross infection\" of bird flu to humans is minimal although fatal.\n\nBased on the website of the World Health Organization, the world experienced the first outbreak of bird flu (H5N1) in poultry in Hong Kong in 1997. Since 2003, the virus has spread to Europe and Africa and that year, human infections with H7N9 were also reported in China, causing deaths.\n\n\"Animal influenza viruses are distinct from human seasonal influenza viruses and do not easily transmit between humans. However, zoonotic influenza viruses - animal influenza viruses that may occasionally infect humans through direct or indirect contact - can cause disease in humans ranging from a mild illness to death,\" WHO said.\n\nThe agency added that most swine influenza viruses do not cause disease in humans, but some countries have reported cases of human infection from certain swine influenza viruses.\n\nFor the longest time, the Philippines has been one of the few countries in Southeast Asia that remains free of avian influenza.\n\nThe virus, which resurfaced in Asia in 2003, crippled poultry industries in neighboring countries such as Vietnam. - With Sheila Crisostomo, Cesar Ramirez, Ding Cervantes", "timeCrawl": "17:58:00", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8675041", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "id": 222, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "id": 1212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

that the Department of Health is on \"heightened alert,\" with health workers on the lookout for possible flu-like symptoms when attending to patients with flu or flu-like illness.\n\nIn a statement,

Also, he said he has ordered the temporary halt of transport of poultry from Luzon to other parts of the country.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said at least 38,000 chickens have died of the avian influenza Type A Subtype H5 in San Luis. \"We will cull all 400,000 birds within the one-kilometer area. We don't want diseases to spread,\" Pi\u00f1ol told reporters.\n\nHealth Secretary Ubial has also advised Filipinos to seek medical help if they have flu symptoms that last longer than three days or if they experienced flu-like symptoms. She also cautioned people against going near wild birds or to farms with fowls.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman Ernesto Abella said \"heightened surveillance for flu-like symptoms is now instituted in Pampanga within a 7-kilometer radius of the affected farms.\"\n\nThe government has placed Pampanga province under a state of calamity due to the outbreak in San Luis.\n\nA 7-km quarantine area has been declared, covering seven other towns, including Apalit, Minalin, Sta.

immediate cull was ordered for all chicken, ducks and quail within a kilometer (0.6 miles) of the infected poultry in San Luis town, north of Manila, said Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol.\n\n\"So far we do not have any reported animal to human transmissions,\" Pi\u00f1ol told a news conference.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said the infected birds tested positive for avian influenza Type A, sub-type H5.\n\nThe avian flu strains that have been known to jump to humans are the H5N1 and H5N7 subtypes, said Celia Carlos, director of the health department's Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.\n\nOfficials have not yet said which H5 subtype the infected birds carried.\n\n\"The transmission risk is low, but the mortality is high. It is a concern,\" said Carlos, especially for infants as well as people suffering from other ailments.\n\nThe World Health Organization has monitored 453 human deaths from 859 cases of avian influenza since 2000, with Asia accounting for 41 percent of all cases.\n\nThe Philippines had not previously reported any human cases, according to WHO data.\n\nAbout 200,000 birds would have to be put down and their carcasses buried, Pinol said, adding farmers, particularly in San Luis, will be compensated by P80/head.\n\nThe six infected Philippine farms only sold their products to local consumers and none had been exported, Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nHowever, the outbreak began in April and the farm owners had neglected to report it to the authorities immediately, he added.\n\nTo prevent the potential spread of avian flu, the government has banned the transport of all poultry products from within seven kilometers of the infected farms, Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nHe said the authorities suspect the virus could have been spread by migratory birds or from smuggled poultry products.\n\nSan Luis, about 60 kilometres (37 miles) north of Manila, is close to the Candaba swamps, a major way station and destination for migratory birds who move out of the Asian mainland during winter.\n\nThe outbreak, the first after 7 to 8 years, was reported to the Department only last Thursday.\n\n\"Twelve quarantine teams from the Bureau of Animal Industry are guarding the exits from San Luis,\" said Pinol adding that the one-kilometer quarantine radius is for strict adherence by the quarantine team.\n\nHe reiterated that the temporary ban was necessary to protect human health and the local poultry industry.\n\nIt has also called on the attention of other nearby provinces to safeguard their poultry farms and immediately report incidents that are bird flu-like to contain the spread of the disease and avoid another outbreak.\n\nIn addition, the Bureau has been keeping a close watch on the entry of birds, poultry and its products into the country to maintain the Philippines bird-flu free status.\n\nThe Animal Bureau detected the virus as H5N1 strain that affects both the animal and human, although person to person transmittal is rare.\n\nPi\u00f1ol assures consumers that the outbreak will not affect the supply of local poultry, although it may have a slight effect on egg supply.\n\nThe Animal Bureau will be sending samples to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, an Office Internationale des Epizooties headquarters for avian influenza testing.\n\nThe Agriculture Department has several avian flu testing facilities in the country, a program of joint undertaking by the Philippine and Japanese governments.\n\nThe Philippines is part of the so-called migratory fly way, during the months of November to February, where thousands of shore birds, mostly from Australia, China, Siberia, and Mongolia, pass by, making it susceptible to the AI virus.\n\nMeanwhile, the Health Department said it is closely monitoring the events surrounding an avian flu outbreak in poultry in Pampanga, as reported by the DA.\n\nShe said that the agriculture department decided to cull around 500,000 chickens to contain the animal outbreak.\n\nShe also made an assurance that the Department of Health has stepped-up surveillance of the human flu like-illness since the reported human influenza outbreaks in Hong Kong and India few months back.\n\n\"The.

avian flu case for the year.\n\nTests done by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and the University of the Philippines-Los Ba\u00f1os (UPLB) confirmed the H5 strain of the virus at a farm in Barangay San Agustin in San Luis, Pampanga after its owner reported that several chickens, quails and ducks had suddenly died, Secretary Pi\u00f1ol told reporters.\n\nIn a report submitted to BAI, indication of the virus started as early as May, but poultry operators were reluctant to report the incident. The situation worsened in July when deaths of fowls estimated to reach 37,000. Based on the report, the flu spread to six poultry farms also within San Luis, Pampanga.\n\nDA officials are scheduled to initiate the slaughter of fowls today (Fiday) that will affect all farms located within the one kilometer radius. Pi\u00f1ol said the number of caged fowls to be exterminated will reach 400,000 but can go as high as one million, including free range, stray fowls and fighting cocks in San Luis.\n\n\"We really have to do it (extermination of fowls) because we don't want the disease to spread. I already ordered our quarantine department to set up quarantine stations in the area,\" he added.\n\nPi\u00f1ol already informed President Rodrigo Duterte and Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Rosell-Ubial of the outbreak and said appropriate measures will be done accordingly.\n\nA directive banning the shipment of fowls from Luzon to other parts of the country should also be issued today, according to the secretary.\n\nCurrently, the avian flu virus is not yet highly pathogenic or deadly, as there are still no reported cases of poultry-to-human contamination.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said his department is looking at two possible causes of the avian flu. He said it can be caused by migratory birds in Candaba swamp also in Pampanga or by an ongoing smuggling of peking duck from China being shipped into Subic, the nearest strategic port from the province.\n\nWith a possible fowl shortage, DA is looking at focusing on increasing production in Mindanao to meet the strong fowl demand come the month of December. Pi\u00f1ol said they are looking for other sources of chicks and hatching eggs that will not come from Luzon.\n\nThe secretary assured, however, that the DA was able to confine the virus in the area. He added that needed compensation will be given to the affected poultry operators. Farm-gate price for chicken is around P50 to P70, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nHe added that the country's agriculture performance in the third quarter will not be affected very much.\n\nFor the industry group Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (Sinag) chairman Rosendo So, the avian flu case should be subjected to a confirmatory first before being announced.\n\nSo cited a case in 2005 wherein ducks were initially reported by BAI to be infected by a low-risk flu strain, but turned out to be negative for the virus.\n\nResults of confirmatory tests from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) showed that there was no active infection in the ducks.\n\n\"That should be the protocol, and the damage has already been done to the local industry,\" he said.

"Malaca\u00f1ang on Saturday called on people living in areas affected by the avian flu outbreak to report to health authorities as soon as they fall ill with flu-like symptoms and a senator urged the government to launch a massive information campaign on the disease and go after profiteers.\n\nPresidential spokesperson Ernesto Abella said there has been no report of bird-to-human contamination in the first outbreak of the bird flu in the country, which was disclosed by Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi\u00f1ol on Friday.\n\n\"We ask our people to remain calm yet vigilant,\" Abella said. \"Any person living or residing in affected areas or who had been exposed to dead chickens who becomes sick with flu or flu-like illness, such as fever and/or sore throat/cough should immediately report to their local health center or nearest hospital for laboratory test.\"\n\nHe said the Department of Health (DOH) has assured that bird flu is transferred via respiratory routes and \"properly cooked chicken meat and eggs remain safe to eat.\"\n\nProper hygiene\n\nHealth Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said proper hygiene, especially handwashing, and careful food preparation were the first line of defense against infection.\n\nTayag also urged anyone who becomes sick after handling chicken meat to immediately go to a hospital to get tested.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said tests done by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os (UPLB) confirmed the H5 strain of the avian flu virus at a farm in San Luis, Pampanga, after its owner belatedly reported that his chickens, quails and ducks had died suddenly.\n\nState of calamity\n\nThe chickens from San Luis, however, have tested negative for the H5N1 strain, which could be transmitted and fatal to humans, said Dr. Arlene Vytiaco, head of BAI's Animal Disease Control Section.\n\nA state of calamity has been declared in Pampanga.\n\nSen. Francis Pangilinan in a statement said the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the DOH should launch a massive public information campaign about the virus to prevent its spread.\n\nHe called on President Duterte and concerned agencies to craft a \"comprehensive plan of action\" to deal with the outbreak.\n\n\"Of utmost importance is to control the spread of the virus and to prevent it from taking people's lives and more livelihood,\" Pangilinan said.\n\nThe Department of Trade and Industry should stop profiteers who take advantage of the situation by increasing the prices of chicken meat and processed food, Pangilinan said.\n\nQuarantine checkpoints\n\nPi\u00f1ol said about 200,000 chickens, including free-range and strays, would be culled and quarantine checkpoints have been established in Pampanga to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nWearing protective gear, government veterinarians on Saturday began the culling in Barangay San Carlos in San Luis where the outbreak began.\n\nAbout five infected chickens and 20 quails were stuffed per sack to be gassed with carbon dioxide and later buried in the farms where they had been raised.\n\nThe DA said as many as 131,500 chickens, quails and ducks from poultry farms in the villages of San Carlos and Sta. Rita would be destroyed.\n\nPoultry farm owner Linda Sumat wept as she watched. She said the outbreak meant huge financial losses because even egg layers that showed no symptoms of avian flu would also be culled.\n\nEvery bird within a kilometer quarantine zone set up by the government was marked for destruction by the DA.\n\nPayment for culled fowls\n\nSumat hoped the government would fulfill its promise to pay for the culled fowls but said the P80 price per head was low.\n\nThe DA was expected to set aside at least P1.6 million of its budget to compensate the farmers for the birds that will be culled. The amount is apart from a loan package that Pi\u00f1ol had committed to the farmers in the region.\n\nBAI Assistant Director Simeon Amurao said prices of chicken could decrease and then increase due to a possible shortage.\n\n\"Poultry owners may decide to kill their chickens to avoid bird flu and sell them at a lower price. But after that, there may be a shortage, which will eventually lead to higher prices,\" he said.\n\nVytiaco said at least 116,000 layers -- chickens raised for commercial egg production -- were affected by the flu.\n\nCentral Luzon, which includes Pampanga, is the country's second biggest source of layers, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.\n\nAs of Jan. 1 this year, the country's total chicken inventory was 175.32 million, 2 percent lower compared to last year. -- With reports from Tonette Orejas and Jhoanna Ballaran", "timeCrawl": "23:26:00", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "extractedDates": [{"date": "-01-01", "textStart": 4401, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4407}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8854229", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "id": 222, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Meat", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Meat", "id": 1211, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "id": 1212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Soups_and_Stews", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Soups and Stews", "id": 1213, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"AGRICULTURE Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol on Friday declared an outbreak of H5 bird flu in Pampanga province, the country's first, and at the same time ordered the culling of 400,000 chickens to prevent the virus from spreading.\n\nNo animal-to-human transmissions have been reported, he said.\n\n\"We are officially confirming the outbreak of avian influenza type A subtype H5 in the town of San Luis, Pampanga,\" Pi\u00f1ol told reporters in a news briefing on Friday afternoon.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said six poultry farms in the province were affected and about 37,000 chicken layers have died because of the virus.\n\n\"The total reported mortality from the investigated farms was estimated at 37,000 out of 105,984 population, or a 4.5 percent mortality rate as of August 4, 2017,\" the Agriculture chief said.\n\n\"There were indications of the disease as early as April. The first reported outbreak is in a quail farm, where there were ducks underneath. The ducks were the carriers of avian flu since they had contact with migratory birds,\" he added.\n\nInitial samples from a farm in Pampanga that reported very high mortalities in poultry tested positive for an H5 strain at the Bureau of Animal Industry's Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Laboratory.\n\nThe samples were found to be negative for other avian respiratory diseases that have similar symptoms such as infectious larynx bronchi disease, infectious bronchitis and the virulent Newcastle disease.\n\nOfficials admitted there could still be poultry mortalities in the area that had yet to be reported.\n\nSan Luis, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Manila, is close to the Candaba swamps, a major way station and destination for migratory birds who move out of the Asian mainland during winter.\n\nState of calamity in Pampanga\n\nPampanga Gov. Lilia Pineda declared a province-wide state of calamity because of the outbreak of avian disease.\n\nPi\u00f1ol also admitted authorities still had to determine where the virus came from.\n\nHe said he immediately ordered the quarantine of affected areas, aside from the culling of all poultry and destruction of poultry products within a 1-kilometer radius.\n\n\"I also called on the local government executives of the other provinces to implement and execute the quarantine\n\nmeasures. In fact, I urge them to set up quarantine stations in the roads leading the provinces,\" he said.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said the Bureau of Animal Industry had put up a 1-kilometer quarantine zone and 7-kilometer control zone for surveillance.\n\nTwelve quarantine checkpoints were put up within a 1-kilometer radius to check incoming and outgoing vehicles moving livestock and poultry, and to limit animal movements within the area.\n\nPi\u00f1ol assured poultry farmers they would be compensated for the culled chickens, at a rate of P80 per head.\n\n\"Aside from the compensation, we will prepare a long-term package for them so that they will be able to recover,\" he said.\n\nHighly contagious\n\nThe avian flu strains that have been known to jump to humans are the H5N1 and H5N7 subtypes, said Celia Carlos, director of the Health department's Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.\n\nOfficials have not yet said which H5 subtype the infected birds carried.\n\nAvian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease affecting several species of birds (chickens, turkeys, quails, guinea fowl, etc.) as well as pet birds and wild birds.\n\nHealth Secretary Paulyn Jean-Rosell Ubial urged the public to take precautions such as covering the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, washing hands often, and taking plenty of liquids.\n\nPeople should avoid going near wild birds or to farms with fowls and poultry, she said, as the chance of cross-infection, while minimal, is fatal.\n\nThe Health department has stepped up surveillance since the reported human influenza outbreaks in Hong Kong and India a few months back.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has monitored 453 human deaths from 859 cases of avian influenza since 2000, with Asia accounting for 41 percent of all cases.\n\nThe Philippines had not previously reported any human cases, according to WHO data.\n\nWITH KENNETH HERNANDEZ AND AFP", "timeCrawl": "14:54:00", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-04", "textStart": 740, "amb": false, "textEnd": 754}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8806698", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "id": 222, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "id": 1164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "id": 1212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Department of Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi\u00f1ol discusses the avian influenza outbreak in Pampanga. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler\n\nMANILA, Philippines - Pampanga was placed under a state of calamity on Friday, August 11, after the agriculture department confirmed the avian influenza or bird flu outbreak in the town of San Luis, Pampanga.\n\n\"During the coordinative forum today, Governor [Lilia] Pineda declared state of calamity for all of Pampanga province,\" Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol said during a press briefing on Friday.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture (DA) said an estimated population of 200,000 birds from 6 poultry farms will be culled and buried in the next 3 days to contain the outbreak in Pampanga.\n\nAccording to Pi\u00f1ol, mortalities of poultry started in the last week of April or almost 4 months ago, but the situation was only reported to the department this month.\n\n\"Earlier today in Pampanga, I made an announcement that I was forming a team which would investigate and look into the culpability of veterinarians and farm managers who did not report the incidence as early as April,\" Pi\u00f1ol said in a mix of English and Filipino.\n\nThe secretary lamented how the outbreak was only reported when it could no longer be handled by the farm managers. (READ: DA: No reported animal-to-human transmission of bird flu yet in PH)\n\n\"We will ask our lawyers and we will look into the responsibilities of farm managers and veterinarians there to report diseases and outbreaks in their farms. Because if they reported this much earlier, the mortalities would not have reached 37,000,\" he said.\n\nBut how did the virus enter the country? The department is looking at two possible angles: the location of the farms near the Candaba Swamp - a habitat of migratory birds from China - and the smuggling of Peking ducks.\n\n\"All these things we'll look into, and we'll determine how the virus entered the country and specifically in that area,\" Pi\u00f1ol added.\n\nSince most of the affected farms are commercial layer farms, Pi\u00f1ol said the effect of the outbreak on the supply chain, if ever, would just be on the supply of fresh eggs in the market.\n\n\"The egg production, according to Dr [Arlene] Vytiaco, is just consumed by the communities around the farms. That's why that could be one of the reasons the spread of the disease was contained,\" he said in a mix of English and Filipino. Vytiaco is a veterinarian from the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI).\n\nPi\u00f1ol then urged the public not to panic because, according to him, the DA and the BAI are \"not unprepared for this crisis.\"\n\nHe also believes local officials are prepared to handle the situation.\n\n\"The farmers who are affected were made to understand that they will be compensated. The lowest compensation would be P80 per head,\" he said.\n\nAfter 21 days of rest period, the farms will be disinfected and the Bureau of Animal Industry will deploy \"sentinel animals\" to the area.\n\nThese animals will be observed closely if they would manifest signs of presence of the virus in the area.\n\n\"After it is determined it is safe, the quarantine restrictions will be lifted after 90 days,\" the secretary noted. - Rappler.com", "timeCrawl": "12:59:00", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 231, "date": "2017-08-11", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 240}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8618391", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "id": 271, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry", "id": 388, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

spread of the disease, Agriculture Secretary Manny Pi\u00f1ol said on Friday.\n\n\"This is a critical problem because this is the first time that avian flu occurred in our country. Hopefully, we can control (the disease),\" Pi\u00f1ol told reporters in Lingayen, Pangasinan, where he attended the Luzon mango stakeholders' forum.\n\nPi\u00f1ol initially announced that up to 400,000 chickens would be slaughtered \"but upon actual inspection 200,000 birds will be culled,\" including free range and strays, he said.\n\nTests done by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os (UPLB) confirmed the H5 strain of the avian flu virus at the San Luis, Pampanga, farm after its owner belatedly reported that his chickens, quails and ducks had died suddenly, Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nCelia Carlos, director of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, said it was the first avian flu outbreak in the country.\n\nNegative\n\nThe chickens from San Luis, however, have tested negative for the H5N1 strain, which could be transmitted and fatal to humans, said Dr. Arlene Vytiaco, head of BAI's Animal Disease Control Section.\n\nBAI personnel visited the affected farm on Aug. 4 after receiving reports about the deaths of the birds, Vytiaco said.\n\nA series of tests conducted on samples taken from the farm in the succeeding days by the BAI, UPLB, the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture (DA) confirmed the infection on Thursday, she said.\n\nThe DA has marked at least 132,500 birds in San Luis for extermination, according to San Luis Mayor Venancio Macapagal.\n\nCulling will take place in five egg-producing chicken farms and four quail farms in Barangay San Carlos as well as four duck farms in neighboring Barangay Sta. Rita, Vytiaco said.\n\nThe infected birds will be placed in container vans and gassed with carbon dioxide and their carcasses would be buried in the farms. The process will take three days.\n\n\"We did not divulge the problem right away because we wanted to make sure that no birds would be taken out of San Luis [by poultry farmers or game fowl owners],\" Pi\u00f1ol said.\n\nHe said the DA had to first set up quarantine stations at all exit points in San Luis.\n\nMacapagal said checkpoints have also been set up in Barangay San Carlos to prevent the sale or the unauthorized disposal of the infected chickens and poultry byproducts such as eggs and manure.\n\nThe DA also stopped the movement of chickens from Luzon to other areas and banned the entry of exotic birds from other countries to the Philippines.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said the government was checking if the virus was brought in by migratory birds that visited the Candaba Swamp near San Luis, or was carried by contaminated Peking ducks smuggled into the country.\n\nThe flu was first detected at a poultry farm in Barangay San Carlos, where 15,000 birds had died in April.\n\nCriminal prosecution\n\n\"The farm owner did not immediately report the disease to authorities so it spread to other farms,\" Pi\u00f1ol said. \"It tried self-medication and did not seek the DA's help. That's why it is important to report.\"\n\nHe said authorities were considering the criminal prosecution of farm owners who do not report diseases that affect their farms.\n\nPi\u00f1ol directed BAI Director Enrico Garzon Jr. to investigate whether local veterinarians also kept the infection under wraps. None of the six affected farms had veterinary health certificates and shipping permits required in the transport of animals across provinces and regions.\n\nPi\u00f1ol said farmers would be initially compensated for the culled birds at P80 per head.\n\nHe urged governors and mayors to enforce quarantine measures. The maximum quarantine period is 90 days.\n\nOn Friday, Pampanga Gov.

Pampanga's poultry farms raised concerns on whether it is safe to consume poultry products like chicken and ducks.\n\nThe \"Filipino\" in us tends to generalize, if not speculate, which leads to panic.\n\nIn 2011, the Department of Health in Northern Mindanao region activated a task force to monitor and enact preventive measures against the spread of H5N1, after prevalent cases were reported in neighboring countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.\n\nExpect also similar preparations are being made as of this moment, considering that this is the first bird flu outbreak in the country.\n\nHowever, let us help disseminate proper information about the virus so we would lessen the cause of panic and misinformation. At least in our own way, we could help the authorities control or prevent the rise of bird flu cases.\n\nBased on reports so far, the infected areas are still within Pampanga, particularly in San Luis.\n\nReports coming from Agriculture secretary Emmanuel \"Manny\" Pi\u00f1ol that as early as April, poultry animals have shown signs of bird flu, and the numbers spiked up last July.\n\nNow, within one to seven-kilometer radius around Pampanga, around 200 to 500 thousand poultry - chicken, ducks, and quails, among others - are to be culled (as to the methods, it is up to animal welfare activists to look out to).\n\nBut should we stop eating poultry meat and eggs? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is safe to consume them as long as it is properly cooked. Meat should be cooked evenly at an internal temperature of at least 73.9 degrees Celsius or 165 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSo far, there are no cases of human infection reported by DOH. However, the agency advised, for the meantime, against getting close to poultry animals.\n\nTo make it clear, the only time H5N1 virus infects humans is when humans get in contact with poultry animals. This can be through fluid or a rare case of air when humans breathe in the dusty particles of an infected poultry animal.\n\nIf you have heard stories of humans with bird flu infecting other humans, please correct them that it is not true because, again, it is bird-to-human means of viral infection.\n\nWHO and CDC already listed typical signs and symptoms if a person gets in contact with bird flu, and shares close similarities with a typical fever. These include: cough, diarrhea, respiratory difficulties, fever with body temperature over 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C).\n\nIt is also possible to experience headache, muscle aches, malaise, runny nose, and sore throat. It is best still that you consult with a medical doctor in order to be diagnosed and treated properly.\n\nIf there is a reason to avoid chicken or any poultry products for the mean time, this is because some people would prefer to be safe than sorry, but always be sensitive also in explaining these things as not to cause paranoia.", "timeCrawl": "16:09:00", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8937643", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "id": 222, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "id": 636, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "id": 1164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "id": 1212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

of Agriculture said on Friday.\n\nIn a press conference in Quezon City, Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pinol said the AI disease, which was first time to be recorded in the country, affected poultry farms in San Carlos and Sta. Rita villages in San Luis, Pampanga.\n\nThe AI subtype H5 is a notifiable disease that can cause illness and deaths to both animals and humans.\n\n\"Initial samples collected from a farm in Pampanga which reported very high mortalities in poultry showed positive results to said disease when samples were tested at the BAI (Bureau of Animal Industry)-Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Laboratory,\" he said.\n\nPinol said he directed to put up a one-kilometer quarantine zone in the areas affected and 7-kilometer control zone for surveillance.\n\nThe BAI has established 12 quarantine checkpoints within 1-km radius to check the incoming and outgoing vehicles moving livestock and poultry and to limit animal movements within the area.\n\nPinol said poultry products from the affected areas could not be brought to other places in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nArlene Asteria Vytiaco, BAI national AI focal person, said tests showed that AI was negative for N1, which could infect humans.\n\nShe said BAI is in the process of sending the samples to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, a World Organization for Animal Health Reference Laboratory for AI for further testing.\n\nOf the 13 farms affected, five have about 116,000 layers, while the rest were quail and mallard farms.\n\nPinol said the local government of Pampanga has declared a state of calamity in the area.\n\nHe also said investigation has been ongoing as to why the disease entered the country.\n\nHe cited two possibilites: due to possible smuggling of ducks into the country or from the migratory birds from China which were arriving in Candaba swamp in Pampanga.\n\nBut he said other possibilities were also being looked into.\n\nBAI only started checking the situation in Pampanga on August 4 as this was the only time that it received information, Vytiaco said.\n\nVytiaco said they learned that as early as April, there were poultry animals which died.\n\nPinol said the government would provide assistance to the farmworkers who are affected.\n\nCulling of the animals will take place for about three days and after 21 days, BAI will send sentinel animals to the affected place to test if the areas are still infected by the disease, Vytiaco said.\n\nIf there will be no more infection, after 90 days, the quarantine and control zones would be removed, Pinol said.

"23:29:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "The avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infectious disease caused by type A strains of the influenza virus.\n\nThe various strains of avian flu may cause a mild form of the disease in birds, characterized by disheveled feathers, reduced egg production and mild effects on their respiratory system.\n\nThey may also cause a rare deadly form, which does not only affect respiratory tracts but also attacks multiple organs and tissues in birds.\n\nAvian flu is transmitted from one area to another by the movement of birds, people with contaminated clothing, contaminated farm equipment and chicken feed, among others.\n\nThe H5N1 strain has posed threats to human health since its first reported human infection in 1997 during an outbreak in Hong Kong.\n\nThis strain is transmitted to humans through contact with infected birds. H5N1 is also spread through bird feces, which, when dried and pulverized, may be inhaled by humans.\n\nSince its reemergence in 2003, this avian virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, and has become entrenched in poultry populations in some countries.\n\nThere were 859 reported cases of human H5N1 virus infection from 16 countries from 2003 to 2017, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO said 453 cases were fatal.\n\nThe first recorded bird flu case in the Philippines was in July 2005 in a small farm in Calumpit, Bulacan. It was found to be a \"low-pathogen\" strain and not harmful to humans.\n\nThe country has since implemented precautionary measures, such as strict bans on poultry imports from affected countries and surveillance of migratory birds.\n\nThe death of an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) after his return from China in 2015 was considered a possible case of avian flu due to his travel history, exposure to live poultry, the symptoms he showed and the quick progress of his condition.\n\nAfter considering the danger of shedding the virus into the environment if an autopsy was performed, the Department of Health instead conducted a fully guided biopsy on the remains of the victim. The results were \"inconclusive,\" then Health Secretary Janette Garin said.\n\n\"The body was cremated, hence, this case has been declared closed,\" she said, adding that there was no other way to safely confirm if the OFW had indeed died of bird flu.\n\nA low pathogenic avian influenza virus, the H7N9 virus subtype, has been infecting birds and people in China. The strain first infected three humans in China in March 2013. In January this year, as many as 79 people have died from H7N9 in China bringing the total human death toll from the H7N9 strain to 100 since October last year.\n\nOutbreaks across Europe and Asia have been ongoing since late last year, leading to mass culling of poultry in many countries. Strains currently documented as circulating in birds include H5N8 in many parts of Europe as well as in Kuwait, Egypt and elsewhere, and H5N1 in Bangladesh and India. -- INQUIRER RESEARCH", "timeCrawl": "23:29:00", "sim": 0.5137255191802979, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 1317, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1326}, {"date": "2013-03-", "textStart": 2445, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2455}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8718991", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "id": 1163, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "id": 1164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "id": 1165, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

it is the best first line of defense against any possible infection.\n\n\"We understand the anxiety or fear of the public but please remember this, we don't eat raw chicken and as long as we cook it, we are protected against any bacteria, viruses that may have contaminated it,\" Tayag said.\n\nThere are still no reported cases of bird flu virus transmitted to humans by consumption of contaminated meat but Tayag said that preventive measures must be implemented.\n\nHe explained that it may take one to two weeks to investigate the outbreak and verify possible cases of infection among people who have been exposed to dead poultry, as well as the residents in the affected areas.\n\n\"And if you get any fever, especially when you handled dressed chicken in San Luis, Pampanga or nearby, then you

Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler\n\nMANILA, Philippines - The Department of Agriculture (DA) said on Friday, August 11, that there were no reports of animal-to-human transmission of the avian influenza or bird flu yet in the Philippines.\n\nAgriculture Secretary Emmanuel Pi\u00f1ol on Friday confirmed reports of an outbreak of avian influenza type A subtype H5 affecting 6 farms in the town of San Luis, Pampanga.\n\n\"'Yung type ng virus na 'to, wala pa tayong reported na animal-to-human transmission (This type of virus, we have no reports yet of animal-to-human transmission),\" the secretary told reporters during Friday's press briefing.\n\nHe added: \"Healthy naman 'yung mga workers in the area, wala naman silang [team] napansin, kasi pumasok sila sa area e, wala naman silang napansin na nagkasakit doon sa mga farms na pinuntahan nila.\"\n\n(The workers in the area are healthy, our team did not observe anything, because they entered the area, and they did not observe anyone who got sick in those farms they visited.)\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) already sent a team to assess the workers in the areas affected.\n\n\"The DOH has stepped-up the human flu like-illness surveillance since the reported human influenza outbreaks in Hong Kong and India few months back and will now look for human cases who may have been exposed to avian flu strain in affected areas,\" the DOH said in a statement.\n\nCelia Carlos of the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) said they have already advised workers and their contacts to immediately report to the DOH if they experience influenza-like symptoms, such as fever, muscle pain, colds, conjunctivitis, or diarrhea.\n\nCarlos said that according to the World Health Organization, avian influenza in humans are usually H5N1 or H5N7.\n\n\"Avian [influenza] is not readily transmissible from animals to humans. In other words, the transmission risk is low, although once the infection is acquired, the mortality is high; according to reports, it's about 50% on the average,\" she explained.\n\nShe added: \"It is a concern, and the exposed persons which develop symptoms should therefore be assessed, especially those in the extremes of age - below 2 years old and above 50 years old - and those with concomitant medical problems.\"\n\nArlene Vytiaco of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) said tests for the N1 component yielded negative results.\n\n\"So next thing to do is isu-submit sa reference lab sa Australia, kasi dalawa po 'yung sub-types natin na transmissible to man: H5N1 at H5N6. So ipapadala natin sa Australia to verify kung ano 'yung N component,\" Vytiaco explained.\n\n(So next thing to do is to submit to the reference laboratory in Australia, because there are two sub-types that are transmissible to man: H5N1 and H5N6. So we'll send this to Australia to verify what the N component is.)\n\nThe BAI is already in the process of sending samples for further testing to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, a World Organization for Animal reference laboratory for avian influenza.\n\nThe health department said RITM has the capacity to confirm cases, and that it will coordinate with other concerned agencies to prevent human cases.\n\n\"The DOH has supply of anti-flu medication and commodities whenever regional health offices and hospitals will require these. In the interim, all health providers should observe respiratory precautions when taking care of patients with flu or flu-like illness. Properly cooked chicken remains safe to eat,\" the department added. - Rappler.com", "timeCrawl": "00:44:00", "sim": 0.4470588266849518, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 186, "date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 177}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8725933", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "id": 532, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "id": 625, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "id": 1224, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

yet highly pathogenic or deadly, as there are still no reported cases of human infection, although the World Health Organization said that human infection is primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals.\n\nBut the DOH cautioned that residents should not go near infected farms or handle birds from areas that have been infected by Avian Influenza.\n\nEarlier, Health Assistant Secretary Eric Tayag said human contraction of the virus is rare as only those who handle infected birds may be susceptible.\n\nBut the DOH is asking residents near the infected areas to seek medical attention if they experience flu symptoms for more than 3 days.\n\nIf there is actual human contamination, this may cause diseases such as mild conjunctivitis or swelling of the eyes, severe pneumonia and even death.\n\nInteraction with humans infected with the flu, however, does not result in \"efficient transmission\" between people.\n\nThe WHO also clarified that there is no evidence that the avian flu can be acquired by eating properly cooked eggs or poultry.\n\nIt could be recalled that 37,000 birds have died from Avian Influenza subtype H5 in what has been declared as the first bird flu outbreak in the country.\n\nThe deaths were recorded in six farms in San Luis town.", "timeCrawl": "16:41:00", "sim": 0.43529412150383, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle":

'I try to give myself some grace and tell myself I'm doing a good job, but I have so much more to grow, and I'm just excited to be in this league.'\n\nWhile breaking the standard for first-year players, the former LSU star is also en route to shattering the overall WNBA record of 12 straight double-doubles held by Candace Parker.\n\nAngel Reese broke the record for most consecutive double-doubles by a rookie in the WNBA\n\nReese had 16 points with a season-high 18 rebounds to help Chicago break a four-game skid\n\nReese's record-setting performance comes a week after her controversial play and remarks after losing to Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on June 16.\n\nRead More Angel Reese has 'main character syndrome', claims Dave Portnoy\n\nIn the third quarter of the matchup, Reese hit Clark in the head while attempting to block a layup from her college rival.

'I guess some people got a special whistle.'\n\nPersonalities such as Jason Whitlock, Skip Bayless, and Dave Portnoy led the charge against Reese. The Sky rookie was called delusional and jealous and got told to 'shut the f*** up' after her remarks.\n\nNevertheless, Reese continued to be a spark for Chicago as she consistently put up double-doubles to help them climb out of their slump. After completing the milestone, Reese gave a nod to former Chicago star Sylvia Fowles, who mentored her in Baton Rogue as a Tiger.\n\nReese's record-breaking performance came in a 83-72 win over the Dallas Wings\n\n'I love Sylvia, she was a great person to me and a great mentor to me when I was at LSU,' Reese said. 'Being able to have that relationship with her at LSU, I know she's going to be super proud of me.'\n\n'I mean [obviously] I just want to do whatever it takes to win, and rebounding is what I do to win,' Reese added.\n\nReese is averaging 10.8 rebounds per game through 15 games this season and only trails two-time MVP A'ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Bayless", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skip Bayless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Candace Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Whitlock", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Whitlock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Fowles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylvia Fowles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/23/86391067-0-image-m-37_1718923367737.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 1195, "textEnd": 1202}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The Fever beat the Sky 91-83.\n\nChicago Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon came to the defense of her rookie Angel Reese, who made headlines for her dismissive approach towards reporters during a recent practice.\n\nFor those who missed it, Reese admitted after Tuesday's practice with the Sky that she has \"trust\" issues with the media for often twisting her words and using it to create drama. As a result, the former LSU star decided to keep her answers \"short and sweet\" to avoid being misinterpreted.\n\n\"I know how y'all like to twist my words, so I'm just keeping it short and sweet,\" Reese said.\n\nEven when promised that wouldn't be the case, the 22-year-old forward only responded by saying: \"\"I can't trust any of y'all. So I'm just letting you know -- short and sweet.\"\n\nWhen asked about Reese's attitude towards the media, Weatherspoon expressed understanding and pointed out how her player is being vilified and unfairly treated with almost every comments she makes.\n\n\"I think sometimes we fail to realize what the athlete might think. What is she thinking? How does she feel? I think sometimes we just fail to realize that because it's almost like every time she speaks, there's something wrong with what she says. There's something wrong with what she does. That's what it seems like. But what we do here as a team, that's really all that matters,\" Weatherspoon revealed, per Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nWeatherspoon did highlight that Reese is \"fine\" and is \"going to be fine\" despite the criticisms directed at her.\n\nReese has been one of the brightest young talents in the WNBA. Unfortunately for her, as she plays the villain role opposite of Caitlin Clark, the attention she's getting is often filled with negativity.\n\nHopefully, though, members of the media will treat Reese more fairly by media instead of trying to paint her as the \"bad girl\" in every narrative.\n\nRelated: Sports Analyst's Unpopular Opinion On Angel Reese's Dirty Hit On Caitlin Clark", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@postandcourier.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sun-Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/61/c61a566c-093a-5982-b2b0-c4a26ec9f001/6673deb5d46e8.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textStart": 67, "textEnd": 74}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Tenacious defense and offensive execution saw the Sky beat Dallas 83-72. Angel Reese continued her impressive double-double streak, making WNBA history.\n\nThe star rookie forward finished the game with 16 points, 18 rebounds, and two steals. Thus, she broke the WNBA's record for most consecutive double-doubles by a rookie (seven). Reese gave reporters a glowing immediate reaction after the incredible feat.\n\n\"I have so much [more room] to grow, and I'm just excited to be in this league,\" Reese claimed with a wide smile, via ESPN.\n\nReese was all over the floor for the Sky on Thursday, literally. During the second quarter, the rookie forward saved a possession by diving for the ball, which turned into a corner three-pointer from Marina Mabrey. Reese dropped a truth bomb on what has allowed her to have a stout showing early on in the season.\n\n\"I just want to win. I came to Chicago to win. Luckily, I was drafted No. 7 and came to Chicago and [have been] able to thrive with great teammates, great coaches. There's a great atmosphere and culture here that really loves me, so that's what's important to me,\" Reese said during the post-game press conference.\n\nReese is not done improving yet, but her early success is something Sky fans should be ecstatic about.\n\nAngel Reese shares the wealth of her rare rookie success with the Sky\n\nReese continued to give those around her credit for her early ascent, noting a powerful message from head coach Teresa Weatherspoon.\n\n\"Being able to have a coach that came in and told me, 'Don't worry about what number you were drafted at.' [Weatherspoon] told me 'Believe in yourself. Surprise yourself before you surprise others,'\" Reese revealed.\n\nIt is no secret that Angel Reese is fueled by gritty play. Reese's double-digit averages in rebounds and points in the paint evidence her ability to grind her opponents down. The rookie forward said she is not afraid to do the \"dirty work\" to help her team win.\n\n\"I'm trying to do the dirty work... I'll step in and get on my knees and mess up nails just for my teammates. I'm willing to do whatever for this team. I think every team needs somebody to just come in and be there for them and do the small things,\" Reese added.\n\nReese's efforts helped the Sky quell Arike Ogunbowale and the Wings' attack. Ogunbowale finished the game with 31 points and shot 43 percent on three-pointers. Yet, the Wings could not overcome the Sky's pressing defense. Chicago forced 15 turnovers on Thursday.\n\nReese was not the only one who helped Chicago snap their cold streak. Chennedy Carter allowed the Sky to quickly gain momentum. She scored 15 points in the first half and finished the matchup with 19 on 80 percent shooting.

During her team's loss, Reese committed a flagrant foul on Clark when she missed a block attempt and smacked her in the head.\n\nThat was independent of her 'special whistle' comment after the game.\n\nThe 'catastrophe' of an interview was conducted by the Chicago Sun-Times' Steve Greenberg, with Reese mostly giving short answers to a journalist who admitted he had not had many previous interactions with the Sky's rookie sensation.\n\nClark and Reese have had a rivalry dating back to their days at Iowa and LSU respectively\n\nReese is one of the biggest stars in the WNBA during her rookie season with the Chicago Sky\n\nReese has made her desires clear that she does not trust the media despite the attention\n\n'I know how y'all like to twist my words, so I'm just keeping it short and sweet,'' Reese said.

'\"What is she thinking? How does she feel?\" I think sometimes we just fail to realize that because it's almost like every time she speaks, there's something wrong with what she says.

She's going to be fine. I mean, she's fine.'\n\nThere's correlation between Reese and the NBA's Draymond Green. Both are outspoken and have a unique aura on the court.

The situation was not looking good for Angel Reese and Co., especially since the streak included losses to the struggling Washington Mystics and Indiana Fever.\n\nOne can only imagine the sigh of relief the Sky breathed after they snapped that skid with a hard-fought 83-72 win over the Wings.\n\nReese, for her part, didn't hold back her emotions after the Sky returned to the win column for the first time in two weeks. On X (formerly known as Twitter), Reese dropped a three-word message to express her relief.\n\n\"God, thank you!\" the 22-year-old forward wrote along with praying hand and pleading face emojis.\n\nReese has every reason to be happy, that's for sure. Against the Wings on their home floor, she's the one who made sure the Sky wouldn't extend their losing streak to five games.\n\nChi Barbie finished with a monster double-double of 16 points and 18 rebounds on an efficient 7-of-13 shooting. She is the first rookie in WNBA history to record seven consecutive double-doubles.\n\nIf Reese can maintain such offensive efficiency while still dominating the glass, the Sky will be hard to beat.\n\nChicago faces Indiana next, and it will certainly be intriguing to see if Reese can replicate her recent success against Caitlin Clark. The former LSU star will surely have plenty of motivation as she looks to lead the Sky to a winning streak.\n\nRelated: Angel Reese Sends Emotional Seven-Word Message About Making WNBA History After Sky Win", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@postandcourier.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Words_and_Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Words and Trivia", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Data_Archives", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Data Archives", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c3/8c3efd6b-e527-5d28-8f75-b1e5deab8e3e/66749eb0c0f53.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 159, "textEnd": 166}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese is the latest to do just that, setting a WNBA record on Thursday afternoon in a game against the Dallas Wings.\n\nEntering the game, Reese had racked up six consecutive double-doubles, tying her with Tina Charles and Cindy Brown for the most by a rookie in WNBA history.\n\nWith a monster performance against the Wings, in which Reese tallied 16 points and 18 rebounds, she became the stand-alone leader with seven straight double-doubles.\n\nDuring that seven-game stretch, Angel Reese has averaged 14.1 points and 12.7 rebounds.\n\nHer strong rookie season comes as the sport is experiencing a resurgence, in no small part thanks to rookies like Reese and the Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark. Both has massive followings in college and have brought that with them to the next level.\n\nThat's been backed up by ratings, as well as social media discourse.\n\nA Sunday meeting between the Fever and the Sky drew an average 2.25 million viewers on CBS, making it the most-watched WNBA game on any network in 23 years. The viewer total represented an increase of 225% from the same window last year.\n\nFans just want to see the latest between Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, who have formed a budding rivalry.\n\nWhile Clark is a massive draw in her own right, she's been quick to credit Reese with the growth of the game, too. Both are pulling their weight in gold for the league.\n\n\"What she's done with her platform has been absolutely incredible,\" Clark said of Reese recently. \"She has an entire fan base that has supported her in what she did at Maryland and LSU. I've played her for a very long time and she's been a tremendous player. It's been fun getting to compete against. I think it's been really good for the game.\n\n\"People love seeing great matchups, but also at the same time, people tune in for these matchups so then they get to see how amazing these teams are. Then they find new players to support and continue to come back for them too.\"\n\nIf Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese continue to the torrid pace they're on in the WNBA, the sky might be the limit for the league, no pun intended.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_goldkamp@on3.com", "name": "Thomas Goldkamp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Brown_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Brown (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/26180933/Angel-Reese-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Chicago is currently listed as the No. 5 team in the Eastern Conference standings with a 4-9 record.\n\nWeatherspoon looked to have the team in line for a successful season, but a four-game losing streak raises questions about the roster's true talent. The Sky has some quality pieces on both ends of the floor, but there seems to be an outside issue that Weatherspoon recently pointed out.\n\n\"They played so hard down there. Sometimes the whistle just doesn't go your way,\" said Weatherspoon via Marquee Sky.\n\nChicago visited the Indiana Fever on Sunday, suffering a brutal 91-83 loss on the road. There were clear struggles on the defensive end, but the officiating may have been lopsided, according to Weatherspoon.\n\nWhile the Sky's coach didn't offer it as an excuse for the loss, she believes the whistle affected the game's finale.\n\nAs Weatherspoon explained, Chicago fought hard. They went into enemy territory and played a battle against the Fever, but the Sky looked outnumbered.

In the process, she made WNBA history, and she didn't even know it.\n\nWith an offensive rebound and layup in the third quarter of Thursday's game against the Dallas Wings, Reese became the first rookie in WNBA history to record a double-double in seven consecutive games.\n\nIt took until her postgame interview on the court for Reese to learn that she'd rewritten the record books.

She had her sixth consecutive double-double and seventh overall Sunday.\n\nShe is second in points behind Fever guard Caitlin Clark, and they have similar field-goal percentages.\n\n''I always explain myself,'' Weatherspoon said. ''I don't say it just to say it because I'm coaching her. You have to sustain this type of play, and not only will I speak about it, but the world [will].''\n\nWeatherspoon credits Reese's confidence for her successful transition from college to the pros.\n\n''She's willing to put in the work to perform well at this level,'' Weatherspoon said. ''She's played against incredible post players already at the beginning of the season, which have been incredible learning lessons. She's been able to learn how to defend those players and how to be effective offensively.''\n\nLast week, Reese shot 50% from the field against the Dream and 80% against the Sun. Those teams have two of the strongest frontcourts in the league.\n\nAt this point, Reese said she's not paying attention to the Rookie of the Year chatter. The oddsmakers have her with the second-best odds of taking home the award -- behind Clark.\n\nSince 1998, when the award was established, only six players drafted outside the top four picks have won the award.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2021, however, three players outside the top five picks won it: Napheesa Collier (sixth), Crystal Dangerfield (16th) and Michaela Onyenwere (sixth).\n\n''Coming into the league, I just wanted to be the best Angel I could be,'' Reese said. ''Not really put any personal accolades on myself. I wanted to come in and bring a championship, help bring championships to Chicago. That's always going to be my goal. I don't care about individual accolades.''\n\nThe U.S. Olympic swimming trials are taking place blocks from Gainbridge Fieldhouse at Lucas Oil Stadium. Two Olympic-sized pools were built on top of the football field for the event.\n\nThe competition prompted some Olympic reflection from Weatherspoon, who won gold and bronze medals in 1988 and 1992, respectively.\n\n''A lot of memories,'' Weatherspoon said, ''especially training to try and be part of the Olympic team.

It's the most enjoyable thing to ever go through because of the uniform you wear.''\n\nAfter their victory Sunday, the Fever have a 40-28 all-time regular-season record against the Sky.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainbridge_Fieldhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gainbridge Fieldhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaela_Onyenwere", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michaela Onyenwere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Dangerfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Dangerfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Oil_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Oil Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napheesa_Collier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Napheesa Collier"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/caf1148/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3206+0+269/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2F0a%2F5ac40a384bf8a871c066a88e6ec8%2Fap24154789943287.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Sky possessed a 4-9 record before their game against the Dallas Wings, which placed them second-to-last in the Eastern Conference standings. Nevertheless, former LSU women's basketball star Angel Reese has been a bright spot for the team. Reese provided exciting insight into the expansion of her offensive game since she arrived in Chicago.\n\nThrough 13 games, Reese averages an impressive 12.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 1.8 steals. She amassed six straight double-doubles between June 4th and June 16th. Yet, one of Reese's criticisms has been her lack of outside shooting. Reese revealed that her growing \"confidence\" and workouts are allowing her to improve.\n\n\"Just being able to get in that confidence,\" Reese said before Chicago's June 20th game against the Dallas Wings. \"I'm taking [more] shots in warm-ups and workouts. I've been working out with [Teresa Weatherspoon], and the coaches put confidence in me. I've taken a lot more jump shots than I've probably in maybe my college career, so continuing to get confidence [is key for me].\"\n\nReese has been working hard to gain a rhythm with her mid-range shooting. To support her claims, she knocked down an impressive long-range jumper during Sky practice on June 10th:\n\nHere comfort from beyond the paint is slowly but surely starting to show. As the season progresses, Reese has made it a habit to attempt at least one mid-range shot a game when opposing defenses leave her open.\n\nAs time progresses, Reese will become more efficient on her outside shots, allowing her to ascend to an even higher level.\n\nAngel Reese wants to continue her stout play to help the Sky ascend\n\nDespite being 22 years old, Reese has already etched her name into the WNBA record books.\n\nFirst, Reese became the fourth first-year player in WNBA history to have 13+ points and 10+ rebounds in four consecutive games, joining Yolanda Griffith, Tamika Catchings and Tina Charles after her standout game against the Connecticut Sun on June 12th. Then, Reese's 14-point, 10-rebound performance in the 83-81 Mystics loss saw her become the fourth rookie in league history to record a double-double in five-plus consecutive games, the league noted on Friday.\n\nReese believes two key things will allow her to continue to produce at a high level: being a smart defender and playing her role well.\n\n\"Staying out of foul trouble for one. Just continue to do my job. I know what my job is on any given night. I have to make sure I defend and rebound, and I think my offense just comes on its own. So just trying to help this team as best as I can. I know I'm young, and I'm still learning. But I have a voice here, and they allow me to have a voice to continue to bring a lot of energy every day,\" Reese said.\n\nIf Angel Reese continues her strong play, she will have a chance to win the 2024 WNBA Rookie of the Year Award. For now, she wants to keep expanding her game and help the Sky climb the Eastern Conference standings.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yolanda_Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yolanda Griffith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamika_Catchings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamika Catchings"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/How-Angel-Reeses-confidence-will-fix-her-biggest-flaw.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "dateEnd": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 664, "textEnd": 686}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 919, "textEnd": 928}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1399, "textEnd": 1408}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 2150, "textEnd": 2159}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Celtics superfan, Dave Portnoy is back with another hot take on WNBA rookie, Angel Reese. The back-and-forth between Portnoy and Reese isn't a new phenomenon. While on the Pat Bev Podcast, the sports media mogul was asked to air his views on the Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese rivalry and he didn't hold back. Continuing his slandering of Reese, the founder of Barstool Sports, stated that she is \"ugly to watch\".\n\nHe said,\n\n\"Angel Reese is a very good player. But she is ugly to watch...she is a typical WNBA[player]. Great on the offense glass, rebounding. But watching her play. Terrible layups. The reason players are captivated by Clark is the way she plays, like Steph Curry.\"\n\nHe even had an answer for those who claim Clark's fame is a byproduct of racial favoritism, claiming, \"There are lots of major white female WNBA mega-stars that nobody cared about. She[Caitlin Clark] just plays different.\"\n\nBut Portnoy's complaints with Reese didn't end at just her playstyle, as he called into question Reese's hypocritical behavior towards Clark as well. He pointed out that Reese, who has on multiple occasions called Clark a \"friend\", didn't think twice before mocking her when she was cheap-shot by Sky teammate, Chennedy Carter.\n\nBut contrary to popular belief, the Boston superfan wants Reese to embrace the rivalry, and not run from it. He even wrote about it in a previous post on social media.\n\nThis season's first matchup between the Chicago Sky and Indiana Fever was a rather \"physical\" affair. While the Indiana side took home the W, Clark had to endure a lot of abuse on the offensive end. The first set of punishment came when Carter hard-fouled Clark, who was standing baseline, eliciting a celebratory reaction from Reese.\n\nThe Sky forward joined in on the assault, as Reese was charged with a flagrant-1 violation after clobbering Clark behind the head during a layup attempt. Portnoy, who seems to have been streaming the game, called out the Sky players for their antics. Posting on X, he wrote,\n\n\"Shocker. Angelo Reese and the Sky doing Angel Reese and Sky stuff. By the way, Caitlin is cooking them\".\n\nRegardless of the rough play, Clark seems to be adjusting well to the WNBA. In the 16 matches she has played so far, CC has averaged 16.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 1.4 steals. The numbers seem even more impressive because her opponents often double-team Clark when she operates inside the three-point line.\n\nMoreover, Clark has shown her potential even while her team has been struggling, since the beginning of the season. Her rivalry with Reese has been touted as impactful as Larry Bird-Magic Johnson and is considered important for the league.

She's been a double-double machine for Chicago and has become one of the team's most important players.\n\nSky star Marina Mabrey spoke on Reese's impact after the game, sharing her honest admission on playing with the rookie.\n\n\"She does all the little things first so that when the scoring, and the rebounding, and the assisting come, it's natural... Honestly, she's only going to get better. She's just getting started,\" said Mabrey via Chicago Sky PR.\n\nThe Sky's roster has experienced extreme highs and lows this season. Some players, like Reese and Chennedy Carter, received backlash after a game against Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever, and the team has also dealt with injuries to star players like Kamilla Cardoso and Diamond DeShields.\n\nAs a veteran in the locker room, Mabrey has the responsibility of keeping the Sky's team intact. She explained that she doesn't have to worry much about Reese since the rookie has already exceeded expectations.\n\nThe chemistry in Chicago's locker room has truly been highlighted over the past few weeks, as each player had to come together to fight through a major losing streak.\n\nRelated: Angel Reese Unlocks New Nickname After Making WNBA History\n\nRelated: Angel Reese Honors Michael Jordan With Pregame Outfit For Sky-Wings", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintrust_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wintrust Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_DeShields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diamond DeShields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Data_Archives", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Data Archives", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/74/f74b003f-b1f0-58a7-9a9e-dbc859c06d9b/66748eeacd6d0.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C74&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Yeah, I feel love real bad. The food is fire,\" said Reese via BullsKickAss on X.\n\nReese seems to be enjoying her time with the Sky. She's been vocal about her tight bond with head coach Teresa Weatherspoon and has also been seen on a couple of off-court ventures with some of Chicago's veterans, like Kysre Gondrezick.\n\nThe Sky may be in a rut, riding a four-game losing streak, but the team is glued together, and Reese is all smiles.

Reese registered 16 points and a career-high 18 rebounds in the 83-72 win.\n\n\"I'm just happy we finally won, and at home,\" Reese said in the broadcast after the game. \"It's super exciting for myself. I try to give myself some grace and tell myself I'm doing a good job. But I have so much more to grow and I'm just excited to be in this league and excited to win some more.\"\n\nReese came out strong and put up seven rebounds in the game's first eight minutes, six of which were defensive rebounds. She has had games in which she struggles finishing around the basket, but she was efficient on Thursday by going 7-for-13 from the field.\n\nThe former LSU Tiger just surpassed the six-game double-double streaks set by Tina Charles in 2010 and Cindy Brown in 1998. Charles' 22 double-doubles is still the rookie season record, which she set in 2010. Reese has already put up eight double-doubles and has 26 games remaining in the regular season.\n\n7+ straight double-doubles by a rookie in the last 25 WNBA/NBA seasons:Blake Griffin: 3x\n\nVictor Wembanyama: 2x\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns: 2x\n\nEmeka Okafor: 2x\n\nAngel Reese\n\nBen Simmons\n\nReese has been a well-rounded rookie contributing on both ends of the court, averaging 12.1 points and 10.2 boards per game. She ranks top five in the WNBA in rebounds, while leading everyone in offensive rebounds.\n\nThis is an impressive achievement, but Reese has been getting it done since she was playing for Kim Mulkey in college. Reese registered an NCAA single-season record of 34 double-doubles during the 2022-23 season when she averaged 23 points and 15.4 rebounds per game and lifted the Tigers to their first national championship.\n\nSylvia Fowles, another LSU alum who put up a record 193 double-doubles during her WNBA career, nicknamed Reese \"Ms. Double-Double Queen\" in 2023.\n\nReese had already broken the Sky's single-game rebounding record, but she set a new high on Thursday. She is also on pace to break the Sky's single-season offensive rebounding record Fowles set at 117 in 2013. Reese currently has 68 offensive rebounds. The WNBA single-season record is 162 set by Yolanda Griffith in 2001.\n\n\"I love Sylvia. She was a great person to me and a great mentor to me when I was at LSU,\" Reese said. \"I know she is going to be super proud of me. Obviously I just want to do whatever it takes to win, and rebounding is what I do to win.\"\n\nArike Ogunbowale had a 31-point performance for Dallas, but her efforts were not enough.

She's the only rookie to be averaging a double-double, with 12.3 points and 10.8 rebounds a game, and leads the entire league with 68 offensive boards.\n\nAnd on Thursday, she became the first rookie in the WNBA's 28-year history to record a double-double in seven consecutive games. The previous record was shared by Hall of Famer Tina Charles (2010) and Cindy Brown (1998).\n\nReese finished with 16 points and 18 rebounds in the Sky's 83-72 win over the Dallas Wings, which snapped Chicago's four-game losing streak.\n\n\"It was a blessing I dropped to seventh, (putting me) with these amazing teammates and amazing coaches,\" Reese said. \"Being able to have a coach that told me, 'Don't worry about where you were drafted, what number you dropped to.' She told me just believe in myself. Surprise yourself before you surprise others.\n\n\"I knew coming into the league what I was going to bring,\" Reese added. \"I don't really care about outside things. I knew my game was going to translate because I rebound and I play hard. I play hard all 40 minutes and you can't teach that. You can't teach that dawg mentality.\"\n\nReese was one of the best college players over the last two seasons, an All-American as a junior when she led LSU to the NCAA title. She dominated in the paint, grabbing rebounds and scoring.\n\nBut there are plenty of great college players who don't have the same success as professionals, whose game becomes one-dimensional when they're going against players who are stronger, better and more experienced than the ones they faced in college.\n\nReese is well aware there were people, and more than a few of them, who thought that would be her fate. Sure, she could rebound, but how would she fare when she had to scrap under the basket with players who were her size or bigger? Could she still be productive offensively, when so much of her scoring in college was off putbacks and second chances and her outside shot wasn't consistent?\n\nReese's transition has been seamless, however. Or she's made it look that way, anyway.\n\nAfter saying at her introductory news conference that she wasn't taking anything for granted, even a roster spot, Reese has been a starter from Day 1. She scored in double figures in her first five games and had her first double-double in that fifth game.\n\nOPINION: Angel Reese is not the villain she's been made out to be\n\nANALYSIS: WNBA rookie power rankings: Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese start to break away from pack\n\nReese seems to have an innate sense of where the ball is and where it's going to go, doing her best imitation of a vacuum cleaner around the basket. She gives up 4 inches to Wings center Teaira McCowan yet, time and again Thursday, there was Reese, snatching the ball out of the air before McCowan could even position herself. She is always moving, always hustling.\n\n\"I just try to get another possession going for us, diving on the floor, trying to get steals, trying to do the dirty work,\" said Reese, who had two steals Thursday.\n\n\"I'll mess up my nails and lashes just for my teammates,\" the famously fashion-conscious Reese said, drawing laughter from Sky guard Marina Mabrey. \"I'm going to do whatever for this team. I think every team needs somebody that's going to come in and just be in there and do the little things.\"\n\nReese isn't just Chicago's most productive player, either. She's been its most dependable, too. In 14 games, she's scored fewer than 10 points only twice. There's been just one game where she failed to reach double figures in either points or rebounds.\n\n\"As somebody that people thought wasn't going to translate, I understand having to just dig it out of yourself and find it even when other people don't believe. You've got to believe in yourself first and that's going to follow,\" said Mabrey, a late second-round pick after helping Notre Dame win a national title.\n\n\"I love to see that from her and, honestly, she's only going to get better. Eighteen and 16, she's just getting started.\"\n\nThough Reese's shooting percentage Thursday was fine -- she was 7 of 13 from the floor -- she knows she can improve on her finishing. Before the game, she sat on the sidelines with a member of the coaching staff, watching video to identify where and how she can be better around the basket.\n\nDrawing a foul is nice. Making a basket and getting the whistle would be even better.\n\n\"Scoring is going to come for me,\" Reese said. \"I have a lot more room for improvement. Obviously, I'm not where I want to be, but I am satisfied right now where I am and will just continue to grow my game.\"\n\nWho's going to be foolish enough to doubt her now?\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on social media @nrarmour.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Brown_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cindy Brown (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Charles_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tina Charles (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaira_McCowan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teaira McCowan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Notre_Dame", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Notre Dame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Angel Reese accused of playing the victim and is starting to identified as the new villain of the WNBA\n\nChicago Sky rookie Angel Reese recently sat down for an interview with Steve Greenberg of the Chicago Sun-Times, and her responses have raised concerns about her mental well-being during her first WNBA season. Reese seemed reluctant to engage in the conversation, as Greenberg noted that she was only providing short, dismissive answers.\n\nIn the interview, Reese expressed her distrust of the media: \"I know how y'all like to twist my words, so I'm just keeping it short and sweet. I can't trust any of y'all. So I'm just letting you know - short and sweet.\" This sentiment reflects her apprehension towards the media and the potential misrepresentation of her words.\n\nGreenberg also spoke with Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon about Reese's demeanor. Weatherspoon acknowledged the challenges that Reese may be facing: \"I think sometimes we fail to realize what the athlete might think...it's almost like every time she speaks, there's something wrong with what she says. There's something wrong with what she does.\" Weatherspoon's comments shed light on the pressure and scrutiny that Reese may be experiencing as a rookie in the WNBA.\n\nDespite the concerns raised by Reese's interview, Weatherspoon reassured that Reese is doing fine, emphasizing: \"She's fine. She's going to be fine. I mean, she's fine.\"\n\nThe article has prompted a wave of empathy and support from WNBA fans, with one individual expressing: \"This broke my heart, I really hope Angel is okay\". Another fan highlighted the lack of empathy towards Reese, stating: \"People don't realize that the treatment she's getting is the type of stuff that will drive someone to the edge. And so many people have 0 empathy for her regardless. Praying for her :(\"\n\nIt's evident that Reese's recent behavior has sparked concern among fans and the media alike. Her aversion to engaging with the media may stem from the negative reactions she has received in response to her actions and statements during games.\n\nReese's current struggles serve as a reminder of the pressures faced by athletes in the public eye and the importance of supporting their mental well-being as they navigate the demands of their profession.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sun-Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Policy_and_Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Policy and Advocacy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Mental_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Mental Health", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/69a5ace85ad6fb997fb0cf99cffbb93b/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/19/17188156585850.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Per ESPN, the game was averaging 2.25 million viewers and peaked at three million, which marked a 225% increase compared to a game in the same window the year prior.\n\nTheoretically, the WNBA should want its stars like Clark and Reese only playing in the premier time slots, so the game can continue to grow its viewership and fanbase. However, Reese and her Chicago Sky squad had a game in the middle of the day on Thursday. This is something that has upset fans, who are disappointed they weren't able to watch the game, especially considering it was a historic performance for Reese.\n\nReese and the Sky went on to win 83-72, with Reese recording a WNBA record for a rookie, seventh-straight double-double. She finished the game with 16 points on 7-of-13 shooting, while also grabbing an astounding 18 rebounds, eight of which were on offense.\n\nHowever, with the game taking place at 9 AM (ET) on a Thursday, it left many fans unable to watch the game with one fan writing \"Who decided that this Chicago Sky game should be at midday on a Thursday? The fans are at WORK! I swear they don't want this team to get fan support or views.\" Another fan had a similar complaint saying \"Any reason why the Chicago Sky/Dallas Wings game started at 11am today? Weird time for a week day.\"\n\nWhile adult fans may not love the timing of this, the reason for the early game could coincide with a camp that the Sky were hosting. As announced back in March, the Sky is collaborating with Nike Sports Camps, and has a summer basketball camp for Chicago youth. The event which is for 7-15-year-old kids is designed to work on the campers' \"basketball skills, leadership development, character building, and health & fitness\". By partaking in the event, the Campers got lunch, a field trip to the Sky game, and Sky and Nike merchandise.\n\nThey are set to have another camp in July and August, where the participants will instead get two tickets to a game since they don't have any games during that period.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_borba@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kevin Borba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/4c/b4c06ccd-4cfd-5ae4-8850-b0f13e1b404a/66748eec4cc24.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes, the midweek practices were swapped out with a second game or a travel day.\n\nThis week, the Sky have two full days of practice before playing the Dallas Wings on Thursday morning. It's not only a change of pace, but it's important for a young team aiming to snap a four-game skid.\n\n\"It helps a lot to have time on the floor to be able to correct those things with movement, as in game movement, game-type of movement,\" Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon said. \"We had a really good practice today with the things we need to work on, knowing who we are about to play, how difficult it is to defend them in the painted area.\"\n\nThe Sky are coming off a 91-83 loss to the Indiana Fever. It was a dismal finish for the Sky, but the Sky and Fever combined for a milestone.\n\nThe WNBA announced on Tuesday the Fever-Sky game was the \"most-watched WNBA game on any network in 23 years.\" It peaked with 3 million viewers and averaged 2.252 million viewers.\n\nWhat will also help the Sky is having a few days away from that spotlight. The WNBA is seeing a massive rise in viewership this season, thanks to the influx of a rookie class that's as talented as they are popular. Angel Reese is the Sky's headliner in that regard, and is showing it with six-straight double-doubles and by leading the WNBA in offensive rebounding.\n\nPlenty of sports commentary has focused on a handful of moments instead of an entire game.\n\n\"Everyone has their opinion,\" Weatherspoon said. \"But, we have to go and play games. That's what we want to prepare for. But I can't speak for other people.\"\n\nThe other people Weatherspoon might be referring to are those who choose to frame the Sky based off a single play from last Sunday.\n\nThe dramatics surrounding the Sky's loss to the Fever on Sunday concerned Angel Reese's flagrant foul on Caitlin Clark. However, Weatherspoon and the players who have been in that situation know there were no ulterior motives.\n\nReese, who was going for the ball on the play, missed a block and accidentally hit Clark on the top of her head. Clark said after the game she knows it wasn't a play with ill intent, but that didn't slow down sports talk networks and radio.\n\n\"No, it definitely wasn't with any ill intent,\" Sky forward Izzy Harrison said. \"I would know. I was there. And for anybody that says otherwise, it's just not even about basketball at this point.\"\n\nThose who were there described the moment as a \"basketball play,\" and the experienced players who shared the court in the moment know it was just a moment that's part of the game.\n\n\"People don't talk about Angel's want for defense,\" Harrison said. \"You play with Kim Mulkey and Kim Mulkey loves Pat Summit. We're a defensive-minded type of team, so I know Angel's mindset ... So, just kind of like it is what it is. They upgrade it to a flagrant I, keep playing and move on.\"\n\nGetting back to the practice court helped stoke that defensive mind. The Sky are third in the WNBA in their steals per game average and sixth in defensive rating, two impressive statistics considering how young the team's core is.\n\nHaving the chance to pinpoint multiple aspects to fix across practice is one thing; having the time to fix those problem spots with practice is another.\n\nThat's why the Sky are reveling in their start to this week. They'll have a chance to get over their hump through practice and not a baptism by fire midgame.\n\n\"I think if we buy into the defensive end, we'll be fine,\" Harrison said. \"If we make that our identity - and that kind of was our identity coming into the season - if we're the underdogs, we're gritty, we're hard workers, if we buy into that, like we were shocking a whole lot of people at the beginning of the season, I think we can get right back to that. But we have to stay determined, kind of embrace that, that identity that was given.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Mulkey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Mulkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagrant_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flagrant foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harrison, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Summitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Summitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The Sky are preparing to take on the Dallas Wings in an attempt to snap their four-game cold streak. Head coach Teresa Weatherspoon has continued to speak on the improvements her team needs to make. Moreover, she emphasized that Chicago is not ready to give up amid their slump, using an interesting \"towel\" metaphor.\n\nWeatherspoon revealed the powerful mindset the team possesses after the Sky's practice on Wednesday.\n\n\"We don't have a towel to throw in. We come in and go to work. See what we need to do [to improve] and battle through. We're not the only team that's ever gone through anything. It's a matter of battling through and getting yourself back on track,\" Weatherspoon claimed.\n\nChicago is in a fight to stay afloat as they chase an Eastern Conference playoff spot. Weatherspoon knows that it will take all hands to help the team rally and get wins. She revealed insight about the players she relies on the most during trying times.\n\n\"Every one of them. We rely upon each other, and that's the lesson. In order to be successful as a team, you have to rely on each other,\" Weatherspoon said.\n\nThe Sky look to band together against a Wings team that is equally as desperate. Dallas enters the June 20th matchup with a 3-10 record, which ranks them last in the Western Conference standings. Weatherspoon knows the game with be hard-earned.\n\n\"We have to prepare for who Dallas is. A lot of it is getting offensive strategy [in line], correcting a lot defensively,\" Weatherspoon revealed.\n\nTeresa Weatherspoon wants to continue helping the Sky improve their record\n\nThe Sky have been able to get increased practice since their June 16th loss against the Indiana Fever. Weatherspoon spoke on the impact having the time together has had on the team.\n\n\"It has been great to have these two days of practice,\" Weatherspoon said. \"I don't think people understand how important practice really is and how that's where things really start. We've had a really good start in these past two practices. So we're feeling pretty good about ourselves.\"\n\nOne of the things Weatherspoon continues to emphasize is offensive execution. Starting guard Marina Mabrey believes the team is better prepared to execute their board offense after successfully running through sets.\n\n\"I feel like we've done a really good job. We've been drawing up plays and translating them from the board to the court. So I have a lot more hope that we'll go out there with a little more focus and concentration,\" Mabrey said after Wednesday's practice.\n\nIn addition to executing the game plan, the Sky need outstanding individual play. Chennedy Carter is one such player who continues to get praise from Teresa Weatherspoon. Weatherspoon spoke on Carter's impact after she inserted her into the starting lineup for the first time against the Fever on June 16th.\n\n\"She's a spark,\" Weatherspoon said. \"The athleticism is necessary and needed to who we are and what we're trying to accomplish. Doesn't matter whether she's coming off the bench or starting. One thing about Chennedy Carter, she accepts her role.\"\n\nChicago will look to continue to rely on Carter and the rest of their contributors in the Wings game and beyond. As Weatherspoon revealed, the Sky do not plan on throwing in the towel anytime soon. They want to keep fighting and climb the conference standings.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Wings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Wings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Mabrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marina Mabrey"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sky-news-Teresa-Weatherspoon-reveals-towel-mindset-amid-cold-streak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1410, "textEnd": 1419}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 1841, "textEnd": 1850, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Not just the WNBA -- sports. Her every move draws scrutiny from her fans and haters, and all sides of the media. Especially the latter.\n\nIn turn, she doesn't trust them.\n\nReese quite literally said so. The 22-year-old rookie does not trust the media.\n\nThat was made abundantly clear during a feisty exchange with local Chicago reporters on Tuesday evening. She did not answer questions. She intentionally chose to keep her responses very short.\n\nAccording to Steve Greenberg of the Chicago Sun Times, her response was simple. And yet, it spoke louder than anything more verbose.\n\nA few questions in, it was clear that one- or two-word answers were the order of the day. And that something was wrong, even though Reese had essentially ignored a couple of questions by saying, dismissively, \"I'm good.\"\n\nWhen asked to explain the two-word answers, Reese said exactly what was on her mind.\n\nI know how y'all like to twist my words, so I'm just keeping it short and sweet [...]\n\nI can't trust any of y'all. So I'm just letting you know -- short and sweet.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if this approach continues through the next few weeks of the WNBA season before it breaks for the Olympics. Perhaps Reese was having a bad day and wasn't having it. Maybe she was just trying to make a point and will pick back up next time. Maybe this is how she will handle press conferences indefinitely.\n\nRegardless of what the future holds for Angel Reese with the media, the Chicago Sky's front office would presumably prefer if its star player would be more gracious. Even if the constant commotion surrounding her antics draws more eyeballs to the team and the sport as a whole...\n\nHead coach Teresa Weatherspoon isn't worried about Reese's stalemate. She is worried more about Reese. There is concern about her wellbeing.\n\nI think sometimes we fail to realize what the athlete might think What is she thinking? How does she feel? I think sometimes we just fail to realize that because it's almost like every time she speaks, there's something wrong with what she says. There's something wrong with what she does. That's what it seems like. But what we do here as a team, that's really all that matters.\n\nUnfortunately, Weatherspoon's mention of \"what we do here as a team\" doesn't make things any better.\n\nThe Sky are one of the three-worst teams in the WNBA. Chicago is 4-9. What \"we do here as a team,\" right now, is lose.\n\nAs for Reese specifically, Weatherspoon made a subtle slip up that seemed to offer some insight.\n\nShe's fine. She's going to be fine. I mean, she's fine.\n\nThere is a discrepancy in that messaging. Is she fine or is she going to be fine. Is \"fine\" a good thing?\n\nReese is clearly struggling with the outside perspective and constant narratives about her character -- even if she brought a lot of it upon herself. It is hard!

Both Top 10 picks from the 2024 WNBA draft look to be the franchise's cornerstones for the next few years.\n\nWith the tandem coming together, WNBA fans have been quick to give them a joint nickname. Fans online are calling Reese and Cardoso the \"Sky Scrapers.\"\n\nThe nickname is likely inspired by the team's name as well as the heights of both rookies, with Reese standing at 6 feet 3 inches and Cardoso at 6 feet 7 inches.\n\nThe \"Sky Scrapers\" have been putting out impressive stats for Chicago so far. Reese is currently giving 12.1 points and 10.2 rebounds on the year, while Cardoso has posted an average of 8.4 points and 6.3 rebounds.\n\nRelated: Chicago Sky Coach Turns Heads With Abrupt Walkout After Loss to Mystics\n\nRelated: Former No. 1 Overall Pick Declares There's A New Face Of The WNBA", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Weatherspoon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teresa Weatherspoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WNBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/b7/8b7dc56d-c2d2-570a-b542-bc343f736505/6673c25080b02.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C81&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Wears Special Michael Jordan-Themed Pregame Outfit", "body": "Angel Reese is beginning her professional sports career in the city of Chicago, and she paid homage to one of the city's greatest athletes of all time on Thursday afternoon.\n\nReese arrived to the Chicago Sky's game against the Dallas Wings in a custom sweater filled with images of Michael Jordan.\n\nSome of the moments commemorated on the sweater include Jordan's championship wins as well as his victories in the All-Star weekend dunk contest.\n\nReese is building an impressive rookie campaign of her own with a string of double-doubles in each of her last six games.\n\nShe leads all rookies with 10.2 rebounds peer game, and if her offense can catch up with the development of her defense and rebounding, she has a real chance to become a star in the league.\n\nUnfortunately for the Sky, Reese's individual efforts in her last few games haven't translated to wins.\n\nChicago has lost four straight heading into Thursday's matinee against the Dallas Wings, with the team's last win coming against the Washington Mystics on June 6.\n\nThey'll look to get back into the win column with a victory over a Dallas team that has lost eight games in a row dating back to the end of May.\n\nThe Sky need a win to get their season back on track, and it seems that they'll have a good chance to get there on Thursday.\n\nThe Sky will face the Wings on Thursday with another matchup against Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever looming on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIt'll be the third matchup between Reese and Clark in the pros, and Clark's Fever have been able to win each of the previous two meetings.\n\nWe'll see what happens next in what has become one of the most interesting player-based rivalries in sports.\n\nRelated: Angel

Meanwhile, the back-to-back champion Aces are .500, with as many losses in the first five weeks of this season as they had all last season.\n\nCoach Cheryl Reeve is making fools of anyone who predicted the Lynx would be a bottom-tier team. They're No. 3 in the league at 11-3 with two former Sky players -- guard Courtney Williams and forward Alanna Smith -- and forward Napheesa Collier, who already belongs in MVP discussions.\n\nSure, it's early, but outside the playoff picture looking in are the Sky.\n\n\"We just had a heck of a practice,\" Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon said Tuesday morning. \"We're pleased with where we are.\"\n\nWhere they were was ninth in the standings, riding a four-game losing streak.\n\n\"We've worked on a lot of things that we need to be better with,\" Weatherspoon said. \"We recognize we need to be better.\"\n\nAhead of a 91-83 loss to the Fever on Sunday, Weatherspoon addressed the team's biggest cause for concern -- first-quarter lulls -- by switching up her starting five, inserting guards Lindsay Allen and Chennedy Carter in place of guard Dana Evans and swing player Diamond DeShields.\n\nThe results were significant. After averaging 19.2 first-quarter points through the first 12 games, the Sky scored 26 in the first 10 minutes Sunday.\n\nHowever, other concerns remain. The Sky are averaging 20.7 fouls per game, the most in the league. They committed six in the fourth quarter Sunday.\n\nSimple inexperience is another issue. Late in games, especially, the Sky are failing to execute the plays that Weatherspoon is drawing up.\n\n\"We were a super-new team,\" guard Marina Mabrey said Sunday. \"That's not an excuse, but there are some growing pains. Executing down the stretch, what the coach draws up, individually so that we as a team can succeed -- it's important.\"\n\nWeatherspoon and Mabrey both suggested the poor execution and breakdowns were a result of players flat-out blanking.\n\n\"No. 1, maybe just forgetting what you're supposed to do,\" Mabrey said.\n\nThe Sky will close out the first half with seven of nine games against opponents in the top half of the league.

This game was highly anticipated not just for the teams' standings but also for the burgeoning rivalry between two of the league's most exciting rookies: Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The clash was good!\n\nCaitlin Clark led Indiana, finishing with an impressive stat line of 23 points, nine assists, and eight rebounds. Her near triple-double performance was pivotal in securing Indiana's first winning streak. Clark's ability to control the game, distribute the ball, and score at crucial moments showcased why she is considered one of the brightest young stars in the league.\n\nOn the other side, Angel Reese also delivered a strong performance for Chicago. Despite battling foul trouble, Reese managed to score 11 points, grab 13 rebounds, and dish out five assists. Her tenacity on the boards and playmaking abilities were on full display, highlighting her versatility and importance to the Sky's lineup.\n\nThis game was more than just a matchup between two teams; it was a renewal of a rivalry that has captured the imagination of basketball fans. Earlier in the season, a game between these two teams ended in controversy when Chennedy Carter's foul on Clark sparked heated debates and discussions for days. This rematch carried the weight of that previous encounter, adding layers of intrigue.\n\nClark and Reese's impact extends beyond their on-court performances. On Tuesday morning, the WNBA announced that this game was the league's most-watched in 23 years. This milestone shows the drawing power of these young stars and the increasing popularity of the WNBA. Fans are not only tuning in to watch Clark and Reese but are also getting a chance to appreciate the talents of their teammates and the high level of competition in the league.\n\nAs the season progresses, the battles between Clark and Reese will continue to be a significant draw. Their duels are just a part of a larger narrative of a league that is gaining momentum and expanding its fan base. The excitement they bring to the court is infectious, and their influence is helping to shape the future of women's basketball.", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennedy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennedy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.hola.com/us/horizon/landscape/138852c9433c-gettyimages-2155295914.jpg?im=Resize=(1200)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, when the LSU product got a question she didn't like, she dismissively replied, \"I'm good.\"\n\nWhen asked about her refusal to answer certain questions, Reese clarified that she doesn't trust the media.\n\n\"I know how y'all like to twist my words, so I'm just keeping it short and sweet,\" she said. \"I can't trust any of y'all. So I'm just letting you know -- short and sweet.\"\n\nThat's \"short and sweet.\" Though, Reese did not clearly state how she felt the media twisted her words. Or even which words she felt the press twisted.\n\nPossibly, Reese could have been referring to her post-game press conference on Sunday when she accused referees of playing favorites by implying that officials had a \"special whistle\" for Caitlin Clark.\n\n\"For inside, I think we were playing really hard,\" Reese said. \"I think we went up really strong, and a lot of times, we didn't get a lot of calls. And going back and looking at the film, I saw a lot of calls that weren't made; I guess some people got a special whistle, but just being able to play as best as we can.\n\n\"I guess some people got a special whistle\"\n\nAngel Reese after she almost took Caitlin Clark's head offpic.twitter.com/fAQMMcFNLB\n\n-- Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) June 16, 2024\n\n\"I'm proud of Kamilla going out and still getting a double-double. That's something that y'all are not going to be able to stop, regardless of the referees, like, we're here for a while; we're not going to be denied, no matter what you guys try to do. Our goal is to win; we're going to do whatever it takes to win and continue to do that.\"\n\nIt seems like there are several \"special whistles\" out there. Reese has collected five personal fouls in six of Chicago's 13 games this year. She has only played Caitlin Clark twice. So, clearly, her frequent penalization cannot be chalked up to only Clark's \"special whistle.\"\n\nI trust I am among friends when I write that hostility towards the press is well warranted, except for Breitbart, of course. The mainstream outlets interviewing Reese are not her friends. However, her refusal to answer these questions draws into doubt her claim that she's comfortable being the villain.\n\nAs Reese said herself, \"I'll take the bad guy role, and I'll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates. And, if I want to be that...I know I'll go down in history. I'll look back in 20 years and be like, 'Yeah, the reason why we watching women's basketball is not just because of one person. It's because of me, too.' And I want you all to realize that, like, it's not just because of one person. A lot of us have done so much for this game.\"\n\nReally?

Smith Says Race Helps Fuel Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese Rivalry", "body": "ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith discussed the ongoing rivalry between Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark on Thursday, suggesting the intensity behind it is fueled in part by race.\n\nSmith was fielding questions presented by followers on X. One sports fan wondered if the WNBA stars were being \"used to create race wars.\"\n\nWhile insisting the opposing styles of the Chicago Sky forward and the Indiana Fever guard were the main factor in creating a dynamic that draws eyes to their head-to-head matchups, Smith conceded that race does play a role.\n\n\"If two black girls or two white girls were going at it, would it be nearly as appealing?\" he asked. \"I would say no.\" (RELATED: Caitlin Clark Nearly Gets Her Head Taken Off After Ruthless Swipe From Mystics' Stefanie Dolson)\n\nThe First Take host pointed out that the rivalry didn't truly get on the board until Clark's Iowa team was defeated by Reese's LSU Tigers in the 2023 NCAA women's championship game.\n\n\"You could say race, but the reality is that there wasn't any kind of warfare, per se, until Caitlin Clark was busting everybody's living you-know-what and waving her hand in their face like that. 'You can't see me,' whatever. And then Angel Reese met her in the NCAA Tournament and smoked her. With LSU. Took out Iowa. And that's what made Angel Reese famous to this level,\" Smith said.\n\nIt's certainly taken off since then. Reese has been criticized for wildly cheering on the sideline as teammate Chennedy Carter delivered a hip-check away from the ball that floored Clark in their first matchup. Angel then leveled her with a clothesline in the rematch.\n\nSmith contends that the juxtaposition of each player's styles on and off the court is the main fuel behind the ongoing rivalry.\n\n\"Caitlin Clark says the right things, tries to avoid controversies, et cetera, et cetera,\" he said.\n\n\"Angel Reese is a proud black woman who doesn't run from any noise -- and so when you look at that, that's what I think it's about. You can say race. I think it's styles,\" the host added.\n\n\"Race always plays a role in something like this to some degree. It's not completely out of the equation. It's always that, because America is America,\" Smith argued, pointing out that the white population was declining as a percentage of the entire U.S. population.\n\n\"That's why you got a lot of people in the United States of America right now, very, very iffy about some of the things that they're seeing. Because there is a fear that society as we once knew it is evaporating before our eyes, and some people handle it better than others. Lot of people think it's a good thing, lot of people think it's absolutely awful for this country,\" he continued.\n\n\"If that's the case, and that's what's in existence, it's inescapable -- that race is going to play a role because depending on what community you come from, you may not look at this nation as being as bad as some other people view this nation as being right now.

Smith thinks WNBA fans are projecting their 'fears' about America's white population 'evaporating' onto Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese amid their bitter rivalry.\n\nThe ESPN pundit offered his thoughts on whether he believes that the pair - who have skyrocketed to fame over the past few months - were being weaponized as part of a 'race war.'\n\n'I don't think so, but that's a valid question,' he began a segment on Wednesday's episode of his network show, First Take.\n\nSmith conceded that the highly-publicized competition between the former college adversaries would 'not be as appealing' if they were both white or both black.\n\nHowever, he thinks their rivalry has more to do with their differing 'styles' than race.\n\nStephen A Smith offered his thoughts on whether there's a 'race war' in the WNBA\n\nHe thinks fans are projecting their 'fears' onto superstar rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese\n\n'You could say race but the reality is that it wasn't really any kind of warfare until ... Angel Reese met Caitlin Clark in the NCAA tournament and smoked her with LSU,' he said of the 2023 college championship.\n\n'Angel Reese is a proud black woman who doesn't run from any noise and so when you look at that, that's what I think it's about. You can say race, I think it's styles,' he went on.\n\n'She ain't trying to be politically correct and polished to the point where she's afraid of being apolitical, that's not her thing, and it's the antithesis of Caitlin Clark.'\n\nElsewhere in the conversation, Smith added, 'Race always plays a role in something like this to some degree because America is America.'\n\nHe continued, 'The white population, once 90%, has dipped to 60% ... there is a fear that society as we once knew it is evaporating before our eyes and some people handle that better than others.'\n\nBoth rookies have found themselves at the center of a media storm, with their rivalry propelling WNBA viewership to never-before-seen heights.\n\nJust last week, Reese committed a flagrant foul against Clark during the Indiana Fever's meeting with the Chicago Sky.\n\n'Angel Reese is a proud black woman who doesn't run from any noise,' he said of the Sky star\n\nThe LSU alum recently missed a block and smacked the former Iowa star on the head\n\nTheir intense rivalry has propelled WNBA viewership to never-before-seen heights\n\nThe LSU alum missed a block and smacked the former Iowa star on the head while she was jumping for the basket. Reese later threw shade at Clark, claiming the Fever received a 'special whistle.'\n\nIndiana's 91-83 victory became the league's most-watched game in 23 years, averaging 2.25 million viewers with a peak of 3 million.\n\nIt's an astonishing 225% increase over last season.\n\nMany commentators have tried to draw comparisons between the Reese-Clark rivalry and Larry Bird's long-running contention with Magic Johnson during the 1980s.\n\nWhile both rivalries began in college - the 2023 women's NCAA title game for Reese-Clark and the 1979 men's championship for Magic-Bird - before continuing in the pros, Smith thinks the comparison is a slight stretch.\n\nWhile the Celtics' Bird and Lakers' Johnson were similar players, Reese is a gritty power forward and Clark is a sharp-shooting guard and developing distributor.\n\n'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ain't competing with Larry Bird as much as Magic Johnson was going up against Larry Bird,' Smith said, before offering the New York Liberty's All-Star guard as a better rivalry for the Fever rookie.\n\n'If [Sabrina] Ionescu and Caitlin Clark were going at one another, now that's a rivalry that I'm willing to entertain because their games are similar.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

She simply described them as \"a tier ahead of their rookie class.\"\n\nJay agreed that Reese and Clark stand out among their peers. But she also picked a current favorite.\n\n\"I am leaning towards Angel Reese,\" she said, emphasizing the word \"leaning.\"\n\n\"I'm not mad at that,\" Moss replied, suggesting that she agreed with the choice.\n\nThe reason, Jay said, was Reese's consistency.\n\n\"Definitely, from the start, Angel came in ready to go, and she's been consistent. So, if I were to lean toward somebody right now, as it stands, between both of them -- because I do agree that it is one of theirs to lose -- I would lean toward Angel because she has been consistent,\" she said.\n\nMoss agreed that Reese's physicality made her more \"WNBA ready\" from the beginning. Thus, she ultimately agreed with her co-host that, if forced to choose, she would give Reese \"a little bit of an edge\" over Clark.\n\nSince the 2023 NCAA championship game between Reese's LSU Tigers and Clark's Iowa Hawkeyes, the two women have energized their sport.\n\nIn that game, a 102-85 LSU victory, Reese began to develop a reputation as a villain in a burgeoning rivalry. She has since embraced the reputation, albeit with a mixture of unbecoming self-pity.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark has emerged as one of the biggest superstars in sports.\n\nAfter setting the NCAA Division I scoring record, she helped her team oust Reese's Tigers from the 2024 NCAA Tournament and then led the Hawkeyes to a second consecutive championship game, where they fell to the undefeated South Carolina Gamecocks.\n\nWorse yet, Clark's popularity has provided fodder for the usual suspects who refuse to stop talking about skin color.\n\nClark, who is white, and Reese, who is black, have become proxies in a culture war that only a tiny minority of troublemakers wants to keep fighting. Sadly, some WNBA players have inhaled that poisonous smoke of race-baiting Marxist indoctrination.\n\nAn actual conversation about basketball, therefore, came as a welcome diversion.\n\nBy \"consistency,\" Moss and Jay meant that Reese has posted similar stats on a game-by-game basis since the beginning of the season. In fact, the Sky forward has now amassed six consecutive double-doubles (double-digit points and rebounds).\n\nBut Clark's weakness has shown itself in the turnover category, where she leads the entire league by a wide margin (5.5 per game).\n\nThus, since neither the Fever (6-10) nor the Sky (4-9) have achieved much team success thus far, the argument for Reese hinges on Clark's up-and-down performances, highlighted by a propensity for giving the ball away too often.\n\nOn the other hand, few players handle the ball more often than Clark does. And none receive more attention. That kind of on-court pressure can at least partially account for the turnovers.\n\nComparisons between athletes can be tricky enough when they involve players from the same sport. Thus, comparisons to players from other sports almost always involve things like intangibles or circumstances.\n\nWith that in mind, one useful comparison to Clark's current situation dates back more than a quarter-century.\n\nIn 1998, the NFL's Indianapolis Colts made Peyton Manning the first overall pick in the draft.\n\nThen, as a rookie, Manning showed flashes of his future Hall of Fame brilliance by throwing for 3,739 yards and 26 touchdowns.\n\nBut he also led the league with 28 interceptions as the quarterback of a dreadful Colts team that won only three games. As a result, in the Rookie of the Year balloting, he finished a very distant second to Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss, another future Hall of Famer.\n\nFive MVP awards and two Super Bowl titles later, Manning's career turned out fine. In fact, in the 12 full seasons he played between 2002 and 2014, he threw for at least 27 touchdowns and never threw more than 19 interceptions and his teams won at least 10 games each season.\n\nIn other words, Manning became the model of consistency.\n\nClark might not win the 2024 Rookie of the Year award. But give her time. She has Manning-like potential in a league that desperately needs that kind of star.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_schwarz@westernjournal.com", "name": "Michael Schwarz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Reese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angel Reese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Randy Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Hawkeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Hawkeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Gamecocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Reese-Clark-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665658", "eventUri": "eng-9665658", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Smith doesn't buy into the idea that the conversation around Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese is entirely about race.\n\nOn a recent episode of The Stephen A. Smith Show, Smith responded to a number of questions from fans on social media. When one fan asked if he believes the two WNBA rookies are being used to \"create race wars,\" Smith acknowledged why some would think that but ultimately pushed back on it.\n\n\"I don't think so, but that's a valid question,\" he said. \"If two Black girls or two White girls were going at it, would it be nearly as appealing? I would say no. You can say race, but the reality is that it wasn't really any kind of warfare -- per se -- until Caitlin Clark was busting everybody's you-know-what and waving her hand in their face like that... and then Angel Reese met her in the NCAA tournament and smoked her with LSU. And that's what made Angel Reese famous to this level.\"\n\nSmith also touched on their personality differences. While Clark \"tries to avoid controversies,\" he said, Reese is a \"proud Black woman who doesn't run from any noise.\"\n\n\"You can say race. I think it's styles,\" Smith continued. \"I think if Caitlin Clark was as outspoken as Angel Reese -- and they played the same position -- their battles would be embraced more favorably; but Angel Reese is a forward [and] Caitlin Clark is a guard. Their style of play is completely different. Caitlin Clark actually plays with more sizzle in her game because she can pull up from the logo. Angel Reese ain't that kind of player, but she's rough-and-tumble. She can get it done.

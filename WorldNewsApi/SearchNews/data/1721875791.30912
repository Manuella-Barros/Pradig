In a BBC television interview broadcast Friday evening, Farage, who is seeking to woo voters away from Britain\u2019s governing Conservatives at the July 4 general election, drew a link between the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastwards over the past few decades and the invasion. Claiming that he warned of a potential war in Ukraine in 2014, when he was a member of the European Parliament, Farage said \u201cwe provoked this war.\u201d It's unclear whether his warning came before or after Russia had annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in February 2014. \u201cIt was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, \u2018They\u2019re coming for us again\u2019 and to go to war,\" Farage said. \u201cIt\u2019s, you know, of course it\u2019s his fault \u2014 he\u2019s used what we\u2019ve done as an excuse.\u201d Farage's critics from across the political spectrum slammed his statement, with many describing him as a Putin apologist. In perhaps his sharpest criticism of Farage, Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to say the West provoked Putin into launching a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. \u201cThis is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who\u2019s doing deals with countries like North Korea,\" Sunak said. \"And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain\u2019s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.\u201d Many Conservatives, including Sunak, have largely held back from overly criticizing Farage, who though not a lawmaker in the U.K. Parliament, was hugely influential in Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU in 2016. The worry among many Conservatives is that attacking him too much will further alienate many Conservative voters, who sympathize with his tough rhetoric on issues like immigration and Brexit. In many constituencies around the country, Conservatives have argued that a vote for Reform would see the main opposition Labour Party come through the middle and win. \u201cI think Nigel Farage is a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says if \u2018I was running the country\u2019 and presents very simplistic answers to actually, I am afraid in the 21st century, complex problems,\u201d Ben Wallace, the former Conservative defense secretary who has stood down as a lawmaker, told BBC radio. This is the first general election that Reform U.K. is contesting and it has enjoyed a lift in the polls after Farage said in early June he would lead the party and contest the seat in Clacton in southeast England. Though the party is not expected to secure many seats, Farage is currently favorite to win his contest and finally enter Parliament after seven attempts. Keir Starmer, leader of the left-of-center Labour Party who is widely expected to become prime minister after the election, labelled Farage's comments as \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d \u201cAnyone who is standing for Parliament ought to be really clear that Russia is the aggressor,\" he said.", "summary": "Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform U.K. party, is facing wide-ranging criticism over his claim that the West provoked Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/nigel-farage-leader-reform-uk-criticized-west-provoked-111335253", "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b02ef61f-fb35-420d-b745-72c443c6024a/wirestory_7bfbded6b5bbdd874e2ad708e8d78389_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:37:33", "author": "Pan Pylas Associated Press", "authors": ["Pan Pylas Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.22}

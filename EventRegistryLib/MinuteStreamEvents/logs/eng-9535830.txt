Many Jewish students have felt intimidated by protests, which have at times included antisemitic tropes and calls for anti-Jewish violence.\n\nA small group of pro-Palestinian protesters waving Palestinian flags stood along the side of the road as participants marched with Israeli flags from the site of Auschwitz in the Polish town of Oswiecim to the site of Birkenau about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away. The area was under German occupation during World War II and today the former death camps are preserved as memorials by the Polish state.\n\n\"Through this protest we want to say that we bow down to the victims of the Holocaust too,\" said Omar Faris, president of an association of Palestinians in Poland. \"At the same time, we demand an end to war, an end to genocide.\"\n\nThe march took place on what is Holocaust Remembrance Day in the Jewish calendar. A grim landscape of watchtowers and barracks were filled with the blue and white of Israeli flags, a celebration of Jewish survival at the place of genocide.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined.\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, had long avoided visiting Auschwitz. But she was inspired to join this year's march after her kibbutz fended off an attack by Hamas on Oct. 7\n\n\"See, I try not to remember it all the time. But on the 7th of October they brought me the remembrance very, very harshly back,\" she told The Associated Press at the site of the former death camp. \"And that's the moment when I decided, OK, this is the time you should go to Auschwitz to see it.\"\n\nAmid the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled American campuses, Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York, led a delegation of leaders from Catholic, Evangelical and historically Black colleges and universities.\n\n\"The message here is clear. The dangers of allowing hate to go unchecked are real. And we don't need to get to the cattle cars in order for it to be unconscionable and unacceptable,\" he said, referring to the cattle cars used to transport Jews to their deaths at camps under German wartime occupation.\n\nHe said it was essential for university leaders \"to call out, and in no uncertain terms, when there is intimidation and hate and antisemitism. We're seeing it on campuses and college campuses, and it needs to have a response.\"\n\nSome who had planned to attend had to cancel to deal with the protests at home, Berman told the AP, though he

Israel and its supporters have branded the protests as antisemitic, while critics of Israel say it uses such allegations to silence opponents.\n\nWhile some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.\n\nIn the Polish town of Oswiecim, a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters waving Palestinian flags stood along the side of the road as participants marched with Israeli flags from the Auschwitz site in the Polish town of Oswiecim to that of Birkenau about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away. The area was under German occupation during World War II and today the former death camps are preserved as memorials by the Polish state.\n\n\"Through this protest we want to say that we bow down to the victims of the Holocaust too,\" said Omar Faris, president of an association of Palestinians in Poland. \"At the same time, we demand an end to war, an end to genocide.\"\n\nWATCH: How some colleges and students have reached agreements over pro-Palestinian protests\n\nThe march took place on what is Holocaust Remembrance Day in the Jewish calendar. A grim landscape of watchtowers and barracks were filled with the blue and white of Israeli flags, a celebration of Jewish survival at the place of genocide.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined.\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, had long avoided visiting Auschwitz. But she was inspired to join this year's march after her kibbutz fended off an attack by Hamas on Oct. 7\n\n\"See, I try not to remember it all the time. But on the 7th of October they brought me the remembrance very, very harshly back,\" she told The Associated Press at the site of the former death camp. \"And that was a moment when I decided, 'okay, this is the time you should go to Auschwitz.' To see it, even to myself, to remember it again.\"\n\nAmid the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled American campuses, Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York, led a delegation of leaders from Catholic, Evangelical and historically Black colleges and universities.\n\n\"The message here is clear.

This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined.\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, had long avoided visiting Auschwitz, but she was inspired to join this year's march after her kibbutz fended off an attack by Hamas on October 7\n\n\"See, I try not to remember it all the time.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with the Holocaust survivors who will serve as the torchlighters at the opening ceremony for Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu stated: \"Izi (Itzhak Kabilio, one of the survivors) said here: 'The State of Israel is the one and only sanctuary of the Jewish people.' This is so correct, and Michael (Michel Bar-On, one of the survivors) said: 'We cannot rely on the nations of the world who make promises.'\n\nIf it is possible to receive the assistance of the nations of the world, I am always for it. However, in the greatest Holocaust, great leaders like Roosevelt, who was told what was happening at Auschwitz and Birkenau and in the [other] death camps, they told him and he knew, his answer was that he would not lose a single pilot and refused to accept the Jews. They were great leaders. Churchill, who I greatly admire, tried to recruit his army but his army rebelled against him.\n\nIf we need to stand alone - we will stand alone. If it is possible to recruit the nations of the world, how much the better. But if we do not defend ourselves - nobody will defend us.\n\nThe strength at our disposal is the strength that I have heard here, we have no other.\"\n\nHolocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day (Yom Hashoah in Hebrew) is a national day of commemoration in Israel, on which the 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust are memorialized.\n\nIt is a sad and solemn day, beginning at sunset on the 27th of the month of Nisan and ending the following evening, according to the traditional Jewish custom of marking a day.\n\nPlaces of entertainment are closed and memorial ceremonies are held throughout the country. The central ceremonies, in the evening and the following morning, are held at Yad Vashem and are broadcast live.\n\nMarking the start of the day-in the presence of the President of the State of Israel and the Prime Minister, dignitaries, survivors, children of survivors and their families, gather together with the general public to take part in the memorial ceremony at Yad Vashem in which six torches, representing the 6 million murdered Jews, are lit. The following morning, the ceremony at Yad Vashem begins with the sounding of a siren for two minutes throughout the entire country.\n\nFor the duration of the sounding, work is frozen, people walking in the streets stop, cars pull off to the side of the road and everybody stands at silent attention in reverence to the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nAfterward, the focus of the ceremony at Yad Vashem is the laying of wreaths at the foot of the six torches, by dignitaries and the representatives of survivor groups and institutions. Other sites of remembrance in Israel, such as the Ghetto Fighters' Kibbutz and Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, also host memorial ceremonies, as do schools, military bases, municipalities and places of work.\n\nThroughout the day, both the television and radio broadcast programs about the Holocaust.

(Courtesy)\n\nYad Vashem determined the central theme for this year's Yom Hashoah Holocaust commemoration before the October 7 massacres, but there's an eerie resonance between those atrocities and \"A Lost World: The Destruction of Jewish Communities.\"\n\nTaking place under the cloud of seven months of war with Hamas in Gaza, the theme has built-in associations with several Gaza-area Israeli communities that were largely destroyed. During the unprecedented Hamas rampage, 1,200 Israelis were murdered and 253 people kidnapped into Gaza, igniting the current round of war.\n\n\"The whole subject matter of this year's theme is very much reminiscent of October 7,\" Yad Vashem spokesperson Simmy Allen told The Times of Israel.\n\nThe commemoration opens Sunday evening at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. Officially called Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day, the opening ceremony will be broadcast live at 8 p.m. Israel time.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, thousands of Jewish communities were forever wiped out by the Nazis and their collaborators.\n\n\"Thousands of prewar Jewish communities had served as a fundamental and critical framework in the lives of the Jewish people,\" said Yad Vashem. \"The Jewish community, a unique, autonomous social unit that characterized Jewish existence in the Diaspora through the ages, was dealt a fatal blow by the Holocaust.\"\n\nAspects of this year's theme that are connected to current events include the poster chosen to represent the commemoration, as well as work undertaken by Yad Vashem's current artist-in-resident, Shai Azoulay.\n\nThe Israeli artist's exhibition -- called \"Bigger Than Me\" -- centers on the smallness of the individual within the framework of destruction. An example is a painting of a young man sitting in a shoe while adrift in a sea of blood.\n\n\"We experienced... a sample of the Holocaust. We got a sense, as a people, of what it means to experience a pogrom, and we were in shock, as though our limbs had been amputated, and it was a wake-up call,\" Azoulay said of the Hamas massacres.\n\nIn his art for Yad Vashem, Azoulay filled canvasses with Holocaust symbols and Marc Chagall-like images of people floating through dreamlike scenes. The motif of people being overtaken appears several times, including in his most jarring October 7 work, which depicts a dark wave flattening the people beneath it.\n\n\"Obviously, there is no comparison between October 7 and the Holocaust -- we are not talking about six million people here. But the sample gave us an inkling, it's like a cover, that's what this period gives us. All of a sudden, the Jews have woken up, the ghetto is back, the isolation,\" said Azoulay.\n\nAs the artist explored Yad Vashem's vast archives, he began to feel he had \"stepped into shoes that were several sizes too big,\" Azoulay said.\n\n\"Everything became electrified, connected, as if the threads had woven themselves together... The events [of October 7] transported me to the Holocaust, and I felt for a second that we were there,\" Azoulay said.\n\n'Life and continuity'\n\nThe day for remembering the Holocaust was established by the government of Israel in 1959 to coincide with the Warsaw Ghetto Revolt. That act of mass rebellion in 1943 came to symbolize Holocaust resistance.\n\nThe ceremony crescendo takes place when six survivors each light one of six torches representing the Holocaust's six million victims. This year's torches will be lit by survivors Pnina Hefer; Allegra Gutta; Arie Eitani; Raisa Brodsky; Michael Bar-On, and Izi Kabilio. Short videos about each of the survivors' lives will be available on Yad Vashem's website.\n\nYad Vashem regularly invites members of the public to submit content to commemorate the Holocaust. This year's poster was designed by Ira Ginzburg, whose grandmother -- Frieda Teitelman -- saw many of her family members taken away to be murdered in the forests of Ukraine.\n\n\"My grandmother's story is a tale of life and continuity, and there is no better time to discuss the need for rebuilding and nurturing roots than these days after the October 7 massacre,\" said Ginzburg. \"The new branches depicted in the poster symbolize the renewal of my grandmother's family, and the growth emerging from the devastation.\"\n\nAnother opportunity for Yad Vashem to crowdsource is the museum's \"Who is Your Holocaust Hero?\" campaign on social media. In recent months, the museum reached out to international leaders, influencers and actors to create 1-2 minute videos about their personal Holocaust hero.\n\nSo far, Yad Vashem has received \"Holocaust Hero\" video submissions from high-profile names including James Maslow, Ben Silverman, Patricia Heaton and Montana Tucker.\n\n\"The primary objective of this initiative is to foster Holocaust awareness, particularly among those who may be less informed, and to encourage others to share their own Holocaust heroes,\" said spokesperson Allen.\n\n\"As influencers, participants have a unique opportunity to promote compassion and tolerance among their followers, highlighting the enduring relevance of Holocaust remembrance in today's discourse,\" Allen said.\n\n'The most significant Yom HaShoah in 76 years'\n\nBoston's Jewish community is not alone in calling this year's commemoration \"the most significant Yom Hashoah in 76 years,\" in light of the Hamas massacres and ongoing war. Other programs, including \"Six Million Steps,\" are ramping up efforts amid the surge of antisemitism.\n\nOn May 6, the 36th annual March of the Living will see 55 Holocaust survivors participate in the intergenerational gathering at Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland. According to organizers, seven survivors who plan to participate were affected by the Hamas massacres in Israel.\n\n\"The link between the Holocaust, experienced by Jews 80 years ago, and the horrors of the onslaught of October 7 underscores our collective obligation as a nation and society to remain resilient, to defend ourselves and to continue shaping the remarkable narrative of our people,\" said Haim Taib, president of the Menomadin Foundation and leader of Israel's October 7 delegation to the March of the Living.\n\n\"I take pride in marching alongside the courageous individuals of the October 7 delegation. Together, we will rise from the ashes of this horrific attack and foster prosperity and abundance in the years ahead,\" Taib said.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

'Never again' is now.\"\n\nAccording to official figures, 132,826 Holocaust survivors still live in Israel, the creation of which in 1948 came just three years after the end of World War II and the defeat of Nazi Germany. An estimated 2,500 are reported to have been directly affected by the events of October 7.\n\nOne of those is Judith Tzamir, an 80-year-old Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964 and whose kibbutz fended off Hamas militants on October 7.\n\nThe attack prompted Tzamir to visit the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland for the first time on Holocaust Remembrance Day, where she took part in the \"March of the Living,\" an annual event that recreates the 3-kilometer (2-mile) walk from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" Tzamir told The Associated Press news agency, having turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nWhile the militia in Tzamir's kibbutz managed to fend off the Hamas fighters, others were not so fortunate. Daniel Louz, a 90-year-old whose kibbutz lost a tenth of its residents, also came to Auschwitz for the first time since his mother's family was murdered there in 1942.\n\n\"I am convinced that, on October 7, the good souls [of the Holocaust dead] protected me and did not let the Hamas criminals shoot at our home so that I might be able to tell the story,\" Louz told the Reuters news agency.\n\nPhyllis Greenberg Heideman, head of the International March of the Living, said during Monday's event that the Holocaust was \"the worst event in human history\" and that the very word \"Auschwitz\" conveys \"fear, death, destruction [and] annihilation.\"\n\n\"And then came October 7, and perhaps we have to come as a people to the realization that, in some ways, the Shoah [the Holocaust] isn't over for us,\" she continued. \"It's not a competition, certainly not a comparison; it's a continuum.\"\n\nBack in Jerusalem at Yad Vashem, where one chair was left empty to represent those hostages still being held by Hamas, Netanyahu insisted that, while the \"desire to annihilate\" was there, October 7 and the Nazi Holocaust are not comparable.\n\n\"Hamas terrorists slaughtered, abused, raped and abducted,\" he said. \"But I want to make it clear: October 7 was not a Holocaust.\"\n\nHowever, he did accuse the recent wave of pro-Palestinian student protests in the US of antisemitism, comparing them to German universities in the 1930s, and spoke of an \"explosion of a volcano of antisemitism spitting out a boiling lava of lies against us around the world.\"\n\nOn Sunday, an annual Antisemitism Worldwide Report published by Tel Aviv University found a sharp increase in antisemitic attacks globally in 2023. It said the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States doubled from 3,697 in 2022 to 7,523 in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, the number of antisemitic incidents reported in France nearly quadrupled from 436 in 2022 to 1,676 in 2023, while it more than doubled in the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\n\"In the aftermath of the October 7 war crimes committed by Hamas, the world has seen the worst wave

It marks the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the most notorious site in Nazi Germany's extensive system of slave labor and mass extermination.\n\nHowever, many Jews had already memorialized the Holocaust on a different date, the 27th of the month of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar, which usually falls in April or May. The day is known as \"Yom HaShoah Ve-Hagevurah\" in Hebrew, which means \"Day of (remembrance of) the Holocaust and the Heroism.\" Unlike the 27th of January, which sees Jews only as victims, Yom HaShoah marks the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943, a monument to Jewish resistance.\n\nMoreover, the UN resolution designating January 27 as a Holocaust memorial includes Jews only briefly, among a list of other victims (\"countless members of other minorities\"). When the new Trump administration issued a statement marking International Holocaust Memorial Day in 2017 that omitted Jews specifically, critics accused Trump of \"Holocaust denial,\" but the oversight -- which is all it was -- mirrored the UN's lack of emphasis on Jews as the primary victims of the Nazis.\n\nIsrael's Army Radio noted that some of the survivors of the Holocaust had been victims or survivors of the October 7 attack as well. One correspondent mentioned that people who had jumped from cattle cars in Europe to avoid being sent to Nazi death camps were forced in October to leap from their windows to avoid murder or capture by Hamas.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog noted at Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial museum, via the Times of Israel:\n\n\"Throughout the decades that have passed since the Holocaust, we assured [ourselves] time after time: 'Never again,' and we swore that the Jewish people would never again stand defenseless and unprotected. And yet, despite all that, the horrors of the Holocaust shook us all during the October massacres, echoing in all our hearts,\" Herzog says.\n\n\"October 7th was not a Holocaust because today we have the State of Israel and the Israel Defense Forces. Although the results of the tragedy and the shock still haunt us; we don't forget that what our brothers and sisters who perished in the Holocaust could only dream of, only imagine: a country and an army of our own. An army that even now fights in a battle that has not yet ended - for our national home. The home of national independence.\"\n\n\"I say this with complete and absolute conviction -- despite the disaster and mourning that still afflicts us: nothing can destroy this home,\" he continues. \"This people, our people, who endured the most terrible Holocaust of all, and built for themselves sovereignty in their homeland two millennia after being exiled from it by force -- nothing can erase them.\"\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also commented at Yad Vashem:\n\nIn the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly; therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone.\n\nTherefore, we will defend ourselves in every way. We will overcome our enemies and we will ensure our security - in the Gaza Strip, on the Lebanese border, everywhere.\n\nIsrael has also declared a new memorial day for the anniversary of October 7, which will be observed later this year.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_b_pollak@breitbart.com", "name": "Joel B.

At the heart of Yad Vashem's vision lies the unwavering dedication to ensuring that the profound lessons learned from this harrowing chapter of human history can transcend generations, fostering a collective remembrance that endures eternally.\n\n\"This unique campaign comes at a particularly critical juncture,\" emphasized Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan.\n\n\"As the eyewitness generation fades away, we are left with an irreplaceable void. By sharing their stories, we are ensuring that they will never be forgotten. By sharing and creating a community of remembrance on social media we can amplify their voices, garnering global attention.\"\n\nAs part of the launch of this initiative, Yad Vashem invited some distinguished individuals from various walks of life to become Ambassadors of Holocaust Memory and record their own 1-2-minute short video introducing their personal Holocaust hero.\n\n\"By sharing these stories and sharing them with a new audience, we can remember the Holocaust, one story at a time,\" Yad Vashem noted.\n\nTeaming up with Hollywood liaison Lana Melman, author of \"Artists Under Fire,\" Yad Vashem has garnered support from influential figures from entertainment and international leaders alike.\n\nNotable participants include producer Ben Silverman, director Jeff Melman, actors Patricia Heaton, James Maslow, Mark Pellegrino, and Gene Simmons, alongside political figures such as Lord Eric Pickles, Prof. Alan Dershowitz, President of the Claims Conference Gideon Taylor, Canadian MP Anthony Housefather, and British MP Bob Blackman. Furthermore, social media influencers like Montana Tucker, Dov Forman, BBC Broadcast Journalist John Ware and celebrity chef Eitan Bernath have lent their endorsement to this initiative.\n\n\"We are living in a time of anti-Jewish hate not seen since Nazi Germany\" said author and CEO of Liberate Art, Lana Melman. \"The phrase 'Never Again' is not a slogan, it is a vow - a promise humankind made to G-d and each other after the inhumanity and horrors of the Holocaust. By sharing the stories of Holocaust Heros, we are reminded that none of us can be silent about where this road leads us. We have a right to be safe and Jewish.\"\n\n\"The Claims Conference is proud to be part of Yad Vashem's \"Who Is Your Holocaust Hero?\" social media campaign. Each survivor is a hero to us; we are grateful to Yad Vashem for inviting us and the global community to honor survivors for this campaign,\" said Gideon Taylor President, Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, shared his Holocaust Hero, Holocaust Survivor Sir Ben Helfgott.\n\n\"I'm very proud to be participating in this worthy program to help a new generation remember the horrors of the Holocaust. I will do everything in my power. Any moment I can remind the world and successive generations of the truth of our history, albeit painful and difficult, is critical.

On Monday, Tzamir will join 55 other Holocaust survivors from Israel and around the world for a memorial march in Poland, called March of the Living.\n\nKIBBUTZ MEFALSIM, Israel (AP) -- When Hamas fighters invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip perpetrated the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nSo this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, which begins on Sunday evening in Israel, carries a heavier weight than usual for many Jews around the world.\n\nFor Judith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, the horrors of Oct. 7 prompted her to mark the somber holiday by making a pilgrimage she has long avoided: She will visit Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp in Poland.\n\nTzamir, whose kibbutz fended off Hamas attackers on Oct. 7, will join 55 other Holocaust survivors from around the world and about 10,000 others participating in the March of the Living. The event recreates the 2-mile (3-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Mefalsim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Mefalsim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Mefalsim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Mefalsim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Mefalsim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Mefalsim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Mefalsim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the Oct. 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nTzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate from their homes due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates that 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Mefalsim, just a mile (1.4 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate over the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said as her husband Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the spelling of the kibbutz is Mefalsim.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As the global community gears up to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day, Yad Vashem - Israel's revered memorial to the victims of the Holocaust - stands as a poignant reminder of the perils of forgetting the lessons of the past.\n\nScheduled for Sunday evening, May 5, the solemn State Opening Ceremony at Yad Vashem's Warsaw Ghetto Square holds a particular resonance. The Oct. 7 massacres, where Jews living in southern Israel were brutally attacked and murdered by genocide-driven terrorists, felt unfathomably familiar. These events rang a familiar, unnerving tone: of the presence of unwavering hate and the dire consequences that await if we choose to ignore the history of events that led up to the persecution of Jews and the Holocaust.\n\nEclipsed only by the global trend of antisemitism, these occurrences give us cause for renewed worry and angst. College and university campuses, meant to be incubators of enlightenment and leadership, are once again being used as hotbeds for hatred and extremism. This begs the question: If our future leaders are being influenced, what kind of future is in store for Diaspora Jewry?\n\nThe theme of Holocaust Remembrance Day 2024\n\nIt is therefore very appropriate that at the heart of this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day is the theme \"A Lost World: The Destruction of the Jewish Communities.\" A profound acknowledgment of the devastation wrought upon the fabric of Jewish life by the effects of unchecked antisemitism. The Jewish community, a unique and autonomous social unit that characterized Jewish existence in the Diaspora for centuries, was dealt a fatal blow that devastated the lives and communities of thousands of pre-war Jews, many of which had formed the very bedrock of Jewish existence.\n\nThe rise of the Nazi Party and the establishment of German hegemony over Europe plunged Jewish communities into a reality of persecution and terror. The establishment of ghettos only served to further isolate entire communities, forcing these leaders to enforce Nazi decrees and assume duties formerly entrusted to governmental bodies. Finally, the ultimate campaign, the systematic extermination of Jews in Europe and North Africa, inflicted utter devastation upon thousands of communities, leaving behind a landscape of destruction and loss.\n\nWhile the Oct. 7 massacres dealt a blow to our nation's sense of security and serenity, the cruelties inflicted upon the Israeli-Jewish population did not mark another Holocaust. This nuanced reflection honors the individual lives of each tragedy.\n\nRemembrance and education lie at the heart of a remedy for this disease known as antisemitism. That is why the annual memorial ceremony broadcast across the world in five languages including Arabic is so critical. The symbolic Memorial Torch, to be lit this year by Holocaust survivor and Chairman of the Yad Vashem Council Rabbi Israel Meir Lau - someone who epitomizes triumph of the human spirit over adversity - must transcend into reality if we have any hope of fighting the scourge of antisemitism.\n\nAdditionally, the stories of the six torch lighters - Pninah Hefer, Allegra Gutta, Arie Eitani, Raisa Brodsky, Michael Bar-On, and Izi Kabilio - only serve to make the enormity of the atrocities more personal.\n\nYad Vashem's commitment to commemoration extends beyond the confines of mere ceremonial remembrance. For the second year now, its partnership with the Our 6 Million organization seeks to personalize remembrance by allowing individuals to pay homage to specific victims by lighting a memorial candle bearing the names of the murdered victims.\n\nMoreover, Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, has launched an innovative initiative aimed at engaging individuals from diverse backgrounds to raise public awareness about the Holocaust. The Who Is Your Holocaust Hero? campaign invites international leaders, influencers, diplomats, and actors to personally connect with the Holocaust by sharing the story of an individual who serves as their Holocaust Hero. Participants are asked to record a short video clip, one to two minutes long, and share it on their social media platforms.\n\nAs the world pauses to remember the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust, Yad Vashem reaffirms its commitment to preserving their memory and educating future generations about the importance of remembrance and tolerance.\n\nThrough solemn ceremonies, innovative initiatives, and ongoing campaigns, Yad Vashem honors the legacy of those who perished, ensuring that their stories endure as a beacon of hope and resilience for generations to come. \u25a0",

The event recreates the two-mile (three-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nAlso Read | Brazil Rains: 56 Dead, Many Missing Due to Torrential Rains and Mudslides in Rio Grande do Sul; Rescue Operations Underway.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Meflasim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Meflasim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Meflasim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive.

The event recreates the two-mile (three-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it\u00b4s important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there\u00b4s still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany, poses for a portrait in her family home in Kibbutz Meflasim, southern Israel, Friday, May 3, 2024. On Monday, Tzamir will join 55 other Holocaust survivors from Israel and around the world for a memorial march in Poland, called March of the Living. (AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year - highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel\u00b4s national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir\u00b4s mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Meflasim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Meflasim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Meflasim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza\u00b4s population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice - a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel\u00b4s military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country\u00b4s right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Meflasim\u00b4s emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Meflasim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon.

Jerusalem has also rejected allegations, brought before the International Court of Justice, that it is carrying out a genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"From here in Jerusalem, I am sending a very clear-cut message: You will not chain our hands, and even if Israel has to stand alone, it will stand alone and will continue to fight our enemies until victory,\" Netanyahu declared.\n\nSwitching to English in a message to the international community, the prime minister said that during the Holocaust, the Jewish people were \"totally defenseless against those who sought our destruction.\"\n\n\"No nation came to our aid. Today, we again face enemies bent on our destruction,\" he said. \"I say to the leaders of the world: No amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum, will stop Israel from defending itself. As the prime minister of Israel, the one and only Jewish state, I pledge here today from Jerusalem on this Holocaust Remembrance Day, if Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone.\"\n\nNetanyahu continued: \"We will defeat our genocidal enemies. Never again is now,\" he declared, adding in Hebrew that \"during the Holocaust, we were muted and defenseless. We will not go back to those dark times.\"\n\nNetanyahu's comments came only hours after the prime minister -- who is under increasing pressure from political allies on the right to invade Hamas's last stronghold in Rafah -- released a video message emphasizing in no uncertain terms that Israel will not accept a hostage-truce deal with Hamas that includes a requirement to end the war.\n\nNetanyahu's juxtaposition of the Holocaust and Hamas's attack echoed comments made by President Isaac Herzog, who told the same gathering in Jerusalem that \"October 7 was not a Holocaust, because today we have the State of Israel and the Israel Defense Forces.\"\n\n\"Throughout the decades that have passed since the Holocaust, we assured [ourselves] time after time, 'never again,' and we swore that the Jewish people would never again stand defenseless and unprotected. And yet, despite all that, the horrors of the Holocaust shook us all during the October massacres, echoing in all our hearts,\" Herzog said.\n\n\"To me as well, the descriptions of mothers silencing babies so they wouldn't cry and give away their hiding place; of children torn from their parents; and of abominable murderers -- who saw in the Nazis a model to emulate, and who, burnt, and butchered entire families - echoed the horrors among us,\" but \"it wasn't a Holocaust -- because the Holocaust was the deepest abyss in human history, in every measure,\" Herzog stated.\n\nBut while October 7 was \"the day when the most Jews were murdered and slaughtered in one day since the Holocaust\" and \"although the results of the tragedy and the shock still haunt us,\" Israelis have \"what our brothers and sisters who perished in the Holocaust could only dream of, only imagine: a country and an army of our own,\" he said.\n\n\"I say this with complete and absolute conviction -- despite the disaster and mourning that still afflicts us: nothing can destroy this home,\" he asserted, calling for the return of the hostages.\n\n\"This people, our people, who endured the most terrible Holocaust of all, and built for themselves sovereignty in their homeland two millennia after being exiled from it by force -- nothing can erase them,\" added Herzog.\n\nSpeaking in separate events at Kibbutz Yad Mordechai and the Massuah International Institute for Holocaust Studies in Tel Yitzhak, Opposition Leader Yair Lapid and War Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz also linked recent events to the European genocide.\n\nLapid recalled thinking about his father, Tommy Lapid, as he hid in the basement of his home while \"rockets were exploding outside\" during the Hamas attack.\n\n\"I thought of my father in another basement, the basement of the ghetto, a 14-year-old Jewish boy who knew there was no one to cry out to. There is no army that will come to save him. But it was precisely there, precisely in the ghetto, that hope did not die -- it was born,\" he said.\n\n\"On this Holocaust Remembrance Day, in this place, I came to remind you not of the despair and horror, but of what happened only three years after the Holocaust,\" Lapid said -- recalling how after the war his father landed in Israel and enlisted in a Jewish army.\n\n\"Where will we be in three years? Wherever we choose. If the State of Israel sinks into hatred and fear, then our enemies have won,\" he said, insisting that \"the Holocaust didn't just teach us that the Jews needed to have a state and an army.\"\n\n\"The Holocaust also taught us that this country should be good. You don't fight hate with hate. We will not be like them. We will not give them the pleasure,\" Lapid said.\n\n\"The Jewish people came out of the Holocaust and chose to establish the State of Israel,\" Lapid said. \"The Jewish people should come out of October 7 with a firm decision to establish a new, stronger, better society here, which will be worthy of the memory of our parents and even more than that -- which will be worthy of the lives of our children.\"\n\nIn his own comments, Gantz stated that the same heroism that motivated Jews to overcome despair and terror during the Holocaust was seen on October 7.\n\n\"In the days after October 7, I spoke with hundreds who had gone through hell,\" Gantz said. \"The phrase 'second holocaust' was heard more than once. And the stories were again stories of heroism. Little children who lay in the shelters and conquered fear. Soldiers, police officers, and members of the security and rescue forces or civilians, who fought battles with resourcefulness and courage. Who rescued hundreds, under fire and with ruses. Young people who jumped on grenades in shelters and fought terrorists with their bare hands. People who discovered a mutual responsibility and sacrificed their lives.\"\n\nIn the days ahead, Israelis will need to muster more such courage to \"overcome the anger and rage at freeing heinous murderers and at the postponement of fighting\" in order to free the remaining hostages in Gaza, Gantz argued.\n\nThe use of rhetoric conflating Hamas with the Nazi party has become increasingly common among Israeli leaders since October 7, including by Netanyahu, who has described the terror group as \"the new Nazis.\"\n\nHard-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has gone so far as to use such terminology to refer to Palestinians more broadly, claiming in November that \"there are 2 million Nazis\" in the West Bank.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The event recreates the two-mile (three-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims.\n\nMemorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family.\n\nShe had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.Sixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Meflasim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Meflasim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Meflasim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80 percent of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes.\n\nThe high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Meflasim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Meflasim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Meflasim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Meflasim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the Oct. 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nTzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Meflasim, just a mile (1.4 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate on the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said as her husband Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland.\n\nIsraeli official says Hamas demand for end

But in Beeri, it was the first time that I felt the fear of death.\"\n\nA neighbouring house was riddled with bullets. Louz's was untouched. He says he imagined the souls of the six million Holocaust victims steering Hamas away from him. \"They probably wanted me to be here to tell this story,\" he said, weeping.\n\nOther Holocaust survivors participating in the March of the Living include Smil Bercu Sacagiu, 87, whose home was hit by a rocket from Gaza, and Jacqueline Gliksman, 81, whose home was torched by a Palestinian infiltrator.\n\n\"What was left, and luckily the terrorist didn't see it, is my grandchildren,\" she said, referring to gold figurines on a necklace she was wearing. \"That's the only thing I have left.\"\n\nBefore he was seized, Haim's grandson left a text message: \"They're burning down my house. I smell gas. I'm scared.\"\n\nShe said that reminded her of a Holocaust-era song in Yiddish, invoking centuries of pogroms, with the refrain \"fire, Jews, fire\". A veteran campaigner for peace with the Palestinians, Haim said she would no longer pursue that activism.\n\n\"I'm not able to,\" she said. \"Now what interests me is only my people.\"\n\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by Barbara Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "March of the Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish holidays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eucharist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yiddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pogrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Sexual_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Sexual Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_reuters_29/d5517f955d326c9669d1bc31078ba407", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 288, "textEnd": 294, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

This fresh trauma, she said, made her decide to visit Auschwitz for the first time.\n\nOn Monday, she was attending the annual March of Living event at Auschwitz along with dozens of other Holocaust survivors, including several like her whose lives were affected directly by the October 7 onslaught.\n\n\"I'm here to show we are alive, we have risen from the Holocaust and we will rise again from October 7,\" she said ahead of the march, in which thousands of Jews from all over the world, including many youth movement members, slowly walk the 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) that separates the Auschwitz compound from the gas chambers in the Birkenau part of the camp.\n\nThe shadow of October 7, when about 3,000 Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people in Israel and abducted 252, looms large in the event at Auschwitz and at the March of the Living ceremony that preceded it this weekend in Budapest, in commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the Holocaust in Hungary.\n\nIn speeches, multiple dignitaries referenced October 7, including Jewish Agency chairman Doron Almog. He proposed to look at October 7 as a military failure that will strengthen Israel rather than any sign of its weakness.\n\n\"Look, October 7 was a military surprise. The Americans also had one in Pearl Harbor, we had one during the Yom Kippur War of 1973, but even after October 7, the Jewish People is stronger thanks to Israel, which needs to also be strong. We will be,\" Almog said.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday evening also referenced October 7 during a speech at the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.\n\nOctober 7 was \"not a Holocaust -- not because of an absence of intention to annihilate us, but because of an absence of ability,\" he declared, insisting that Hamas had the \"same intention\" to wipe out the Jewish people as the Nazis.\n\nOctober 7, when terrorists overran and torched whole communities and then held them for hours, triggered existential fears in some Israelis whose lives were affected by the Holocaust, several of them said on Monday at Auschwitz. The infamous camp seemed eerily serene and colorful under the spring sun, the foliage of poplar trees swaying in a gentle breeze.\n\nHaim said that memories of the Holocaust came back to her as she listened to a voice message that her late grandson left her before he was taken. \"He said he could smell houses burning and that sent me right back. The smoke, the smoke of Jewish homes, of whole shtetls burning,\" said Bella Haim, who survived the Holocaust in hiding in Poland with her mother and two sisters before escaping to the former Soviet Union.\n\n\"I think the comparison is not only legitimate but inevitable,\" said Bella Haim about the link between the Holocaust and October 7. \"Innocent Jewish families being butchered in a pogrom. How could I not think of the Holocaust?\"\n\nHaim is visiting Auschwitz along with several other Israeli Holocaust survivors whose lives were directly affected by October 7, including Judith Tzamir from Kibbutz Mefalsim near Gaza, where a handful of defenders held dozens of Hamas terrorists at bay. The kibbutz was severely damaged in the onslaught and its members now live in government-funded temporary housing.\n\nTzamir, who was born in Germany, stops short of drawing a comparison between the Holocaust and October 7. \"It was a pogrom, not a second Holocaust,\" she said. \"I'm not downplaying the severity of what happened but Holocaust is about the Nazi final solution,\" she added.\n\nOther survivors from Israel include Danit Gabbai, who was born in Marrakech, Morrocco, and whose son and daughter survived the onslaught in Re'im and Zikim, respectively.\n\nTo Anati Keinan, the Israel-born daughter of two Holocaust survivors from Hungary, Budapest was always associated with danger and persecution -- until October 7.\n\nAfter the onslaught, the city emerged in her mind as a potential haven for her and her two teenage sons. Some relatives of theirs in Budapest suggested they move there after the Hamas onslaught, which shook the confidence of many in Israel's ability to keep its residents safe -- and even the country's long-term viability.\n\n\"For a few weeks there, I was considering it. Maybe they'd reach Tel Aviv, or Herzliya. Maybe I needed to get my family out on time,\" Keinan recalled.\n\nThis week, Keinan traveled to Hungary, but not as an immigrant. Instead, she came with her mother Aviva and brother Yuval as part of the Israeli delegation to the March of the Living commemoration events in Hungary and Poland.\n\nAnati Keinan still has existential concerns about raising a family in Israel, she said. But she has decided to stay regardless, she told The Times of Israel. \"There is no way I'm going back to where my father barely made it out alive. We'll stay no matter what. I'm kind of ashamed I even considered leaving,\" she said.\n\nThe surge of antisemitism in Europe and North America, and especially on campuses by young individuals, \"are just shocking reminders that we really have nowhere else to go,\" Keinan said.\n\nHer mother, Aviva, 80, who survived the Holocaust as a young girl but whose biological father perished in it, concurs.\n\n\"The State of Israel is still the home of the Jewish People. Granted, after October 7, it weakened confidence in Israel's strength and ability to protect all its people but it's still our home, and I truly believe in our army's ability to defend us - certainly better than any other entity.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, despite numerous survivors in Israel who could testify to the risks taken by Eckstein, Yad Vashem's response was always the same. Recognition for heroic rescue was reserved for non-Jews, not Jews.\n\nIn 2009, Eckstein's story was published in The Jerusalem Post. It was seen by Alan Schneider, the executive director of the B'nai B'rith World Center in Jerusalem. He decided to honor Eckstein's memory in 2014, at the annual B'nai B'rith - Jewish National Fund ceremony honoring Jews who saved Jews. The event was attended by the ambassador of the Slovak Republic who took great pride in the fact that Eckstein had been one of his countrymen.\n\nNot long afterward, Yad Vashem amended its policy and also began honoring Jewish rescuers. But the fact is that B'nai B'rith has done so for almost quarter of a century, and as a follow-up, in 2019 initiated The Jews Saving Jews Forum within the framework of the Arnold and Leona Finkler Institute of Holocaust Research. There were and are many more such heroes than has been generally realized. Over the centuries, and particularly in regard to the Holocaust, history has depicted Jews as victims. Indeed they were, but among the Jews of Europe and in the allied armies there were extraordinarily courageous and conscience-driven Jews whose exploits deserve recognition.\n\nThis year's ceremony will take place on Monday, May 6, at 10 a.m., at the Bnai B'rith Martyr's Forest near Moshav Kesalon. An impressive Scroll of Fire monument to the six million Jews who were murdered or who perished during the Holocaust, stands at the pinnacle of the forest. The sculptor is Nathan Rapoport, who created the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising monuments, on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto and at Yad Vashem's Warsaw Ghetto Plaza.\n\nSpeakers at the ceremony will include Italian ambassador Sergio Barbanti, director of the Education and Community Division of KKL-JNF Sar-Shalom Jerbi, B'nai B'rith World Center chairman Dr. Chaim Katz, Brig.-Gen. Gihad Hasan of the Police Border Guards, and Holocaust survivor Sarah Jackson, who rescued young people at the Supernova Festival on October 7.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the Jewish Rescuers Citation will be conferred on 13 Jewish rescuers who operated in France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Poland.\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day and the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\u25a0 AS IT happens, Holocaust Remembrance Day and the opening of this year's Eurovision Song Contest in Malm\u00f6, Sweden are within a day of each other. During World War II, Sweden remained neutral and thus was a haven for Jews and others fleeing the terrors and devastation of war. Many Polish Jews stayed in Sweden after the war, and in some cases, their children and grandchildren are still there. The Jewish community of Sweden numbers somewhere in the range of 20,000 and is the largest in Scandinavia.\n\nSince WWII, people from Arab countries have also found it preferable to live in Sweden, and today account for slightly more than 5% of the total population, which means that there are considerably more Arabs than Jews in Sweden.\n\nMalm\u00f6 is known to be an antisemitic and anti-Israel hotbed, which is why in October, 2021, it was the venue for a global conference titled Malm\u00f6 International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism.\n\nThe conference, co-hosted by the World Jewish Congress (WJC), the Council of Swedish Jewish Communities, and the Jewish Community of Malm\u00f6 was attended by the heads of state and government and representatives of some 50 countries.\n\nAttempts were made to implement plans discussed and promises made, but even before October 7, 2023, the situation had become worse instead of better.\n\nIn the coming week, there will be many discussions - in the Jewish world in particular - about heroism and resilience during the Holocaust, and during and since October 7.\n\nAnother chapter in heroism will be played out in Malm\u00f6 by Eden Golan, Israel's representative at Eurovision. Despite threats on her life, she has not backed down, and will proudly carry Israel's flag. Reports state that she did very well in rehearsals and has not allowed anything to disturb her concentration.\n\nDespite the general ill-will against Israel and the strong political flavor of Eurovision despite denials by the European Broadcasting Union, it's possible that fair-minded viewers will vote for the song and the singer and will temporarily put aside any negative feelings they harbor against Israel.\n\nAviv Geffen performs for soldiers\n\n\u25a0 FROM BEING the bad boy of Israel's entertainment community, who refused to serve in the IDF and tried to persuade others of his generation to do likewise, singer and composer Aviv Geffen has changed his attitude and developed into a responsible adult who made his peace with Yitzhak Rabin when the latter was prime minister. Geffen was among the performers at the peace rally in Tel Aviv, immediately after which Rabin was assassinated.\n\nSince then, Geffen has performed in Judea and the West Bank and more recently has given a number of pro-bono performances for wounded soldiers, especially those hospitalized after October 7.\n\nNext month, in recognition of his contribution to Israeli society, Geffen will receive an honorary doctorate from Bar Ilan University (BIU).\n\nIn the letter sent to him by BIU President Prof. Arie Zaban, Gefen was informed that the award \"acknowledges the honorable values that have guided you on your creative and moral artistic and cultural path, and the work you do for the betterment of Israeli society.\"\n\nZaban added: \"During this particularly complex year, Bar-Ilan University wishes to recognize the extraordinary ability and courage to invite all of us and our country to rise up and love one another, and to lead and influence through actions impacting upon our people and our nation both in the present and in the future.\"\n\nThe honorary doctorate conferment ceremony will take place on June 3, in the framework of BIU's annual meetings of its Board of Trustees.\n\nDemonstrations on American campuses\n\n\u25a0 PRIZES TO Israelis and other outstanding achievers who happen to be Jewish are not quite as newsworthy as antisemitic and anti-Israel riots on university campuses across America and therefore receive less attention.\n\nUnfortunately, major Israeli media outlets are now giving more coverage to Israeli students and faculty staff at American universities than to burning local issues such as the return of the hostages.\n\nFrom an emotional perspective, this implies a gradual loss of interest, but in the absence of concrete developments, it's difficult to keep the story going, whereas physical and verbal attacks against Israeli professors, lecturers, and students are considered newsworthy. This is especially true for well-known figures in American society, such as Tel Aviv-born prize-winning computer scientist and philosopher Prof. Judea Pearl (who has held senior positions at UCLA) who came to global attention in January 2002, when his journalist son Daniel, who worked for The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped in Karachi in Pakistan, and murdered by terrorists on February 1.\n\nDuring this past week, in an interview with Yediot Aharonot, Judea Pearl attributed the pro-Palestinian demonstrations at UCLA to the many huge donations that the university receives from Qatar. The university management thought that by allowing pro-Hamas students to vent their rage, they would get it out of their systems and quiet would prevail afterward. But last Sunday, there was an opposing demonstration by pro-Israel students, and since then there has been an exchange of physical and verbal violence. Popular opinion has it that the university does not want to annoy Qatar, which inter alia finances university projects and provides numerous scholarships.\n\nIf this is indeed the reason, it might appear that Arab philanthropy to American institutes of higher learning is far in excess of the billions of dollars collectively donated by Jewish billionaires.\n\nJewish day school reunion rescheduled\n\n\u25a0 ALUMNI OF Mount Scopus College, the oldest communal Jewish Day School in Australia, who were looking forward to a reunion in Tel Aviv on May 20, will have to wait another six months. The event has been rescheduled for November 11, coinciding with the date of the armistice at the end of World War I, declared at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. The Australian Mount Scopus College is this year celebrating its 75th anniversary. It started out as a kindergarten and a few elementary school classes and has mushroomed into a huge tri-campus educational facility. Thousands of Jewish children have honed their Jewish identities thanks to Mount Scopus, and hundreds of them live in Israel, including graduates of the first two or three matriculation classes. Some of these are Louise Israeli (nee Goulburn), Daniel Lew, Susan Yellin (nee Friedman), Pinchas (Peter) Medding, and many other alumni, some of whom graduated as recently as two or three years ago and attended university in Israel.\n\nIn some cases, 10 or more alumni from the same Mount Scopus class who live in Israel meet several times a year, but all-encompassing reunions have been rare. The most recent was in January 2023 when 400 alumni living in Israel came together with hundreds of current students and alumni living in Australia. The get-together, replete with a sumptuous dinner, was the biggest-ever gathering of Australians in Israel, including the large number of Jewish and non-Jewish Australians who came in 2017 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Beersheba which was won by Australian and New Zealand forces, and which led to the Balfour Declaration a few days later.\n\nMount Scopus pioneered more than a dozen other Jewish day schools in five of Australia's six states.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Her upcoming pilgrimage to Auschwitz is both a somber remembrance and a reminder of the ongoing threat of antisemitism. As Israel mourns the victims of the attack, the event also highlights the plight of Holocaust survivors living in fear due to the conflict in Gaza.\n\nWhen Hamas fighters invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7, the militant group that rules the Gaza Strip perpetrated the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nSo this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day, which begins Sunday evening in Israel, carries a heavier weight than usual for many Jews around the world.\n\nFor Judith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, the horrors of Oct. 7 prompted her to mark the somber holiday by making a pilgrimage she has long avoided: She will visit Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp in Poland.\n\nTzamir, whose kibbutz fended off Hamas attackers Oct. 7, will join 55 other Holocaust survivors from around the world and about 10,000 others participating in the March of the Living. The event recreates the two-mile (three-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\" Holocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors. It is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Meflasim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Meflasim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Meflasim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Meflasim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Meflasim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Meflasim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven. Many Meflasim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June. Tzamir said the Oct. 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany. Tzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel. Tzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Meflasim, just a mile (1.4 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate on the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said as her husband Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"\n\n(This story has

The event recreates the 2-mile (3-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Mefalsim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Mefalsim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Mefalsim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Mefalsim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Mefalsim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Mefalsim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Mefalsim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the Oct. 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nTzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate from their homes due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates that 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Mefalsim, just a mile (1.4 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate over the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said as her husband Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story

The day will also be marked by services at schools, military bases, and other public institutions.\n\nThis year, however, Yom HaShoah takes on added symbolism.\n\nIt arrives in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 onslaught, which resulted in the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. With as many as 100 hostages still held in Gaza and rising antisemitism globally, this year's commemoration carries a heightened sense of urgency and remembrance.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the importance of remembering the Holocaust's lessons and defending against present-day threats.\n\n\"If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us,\" Netanyahu stated. \"Therefore, we will defend ourselves in every way. We will overcome our enemies and ensure our security - in the Gaza Strip, on the Lebanese border, everywhere.\"\n\nReflecting on the significance of this year's Yom HaShoah, Yad Vashem spokesperson Simmy Allen noted how the theme of \"A Lost World: The Destruction of Jewish Communities\" has taken on new meaning in light of recent events.\n\n\"This year's Yom HaShoah is particularly poignant as we remember not only the victims of the Holocaust but also those who have suffered in recent attacks,\" said Allen. \"The resilience of survivors serves as a beacon of hope and strength in the face of adversity.\"\n\nIn addition to traditional commemorations, the International March of the Living, an annual educational pilgrimage to Auschwitz, has adapted its approach this year.\n\nLed by 55 Holocaust survivors, including some affected by the Oct. 7 attacks, the march aims to honor the memory of the Holocaust victims and educate participants about the horrors of the past. University presidents and chancellors from the United States and Canada will also participate, underscoring the importance of Holocaust education and remembrance.\n\nUS President Joe Biden also reflected on the solemn occasion, proclaiming May 5 through May 12, 2024, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of the victims of the Holocaust.\n\n\"During Yom Hashoah and these days of remembrance, we mourn the six million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered in the Holocaust,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We honor the memories of the victims, the courage of the survivors, and the heroism of those who stood up to the Nazis, and we recommit ourselves to making real the promise of 'Never Again.'\"", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Due to the events of October 7 and the ongoing war, they are feeling anxious and vulnerable, uncertain of the future. Since the outbreak of the war, every day I encounter survivors who are reliving memories and traumas from the Holocaust.\n\nThinking about those who are currently hostages takes the survivors back to the camps, the hiding places, and the persecution they endured as children. In the past six months, many Holocaust survivors report fear, existential anxieties, and a significant deterioration in their health.\n\nOver the last few months, the Israeli public has been discussing whether the massacre that occurred on October 7 can be termed a \"holocaust.\" Is it legitimate for us to use this term in describing what happened on that day?\n\nAs Holocaust Remembrance Day neared, in order to examine how the current war is affecting Holocaust survivors, and how those who endured the Holocaust relate to the use of the term \"Holocaust\" in the context of October 7, we conducted a survey in collaboration with the Maagar Mochot research institute. The results are very concerning and demonstrate the urgent need for the establishment of a unique support system for Holocaust survivors affected by the current war.\n\nMost Holocaust survivors (73%) reported that the war has negatively affected their mental state, 64% reported a decline in their physical health, and 53% of Holocaust survivors said that the events of the war bring back memories from the Holocaust.\n\nFurthermore, the survey revealed that since the outbreak of the war, 51% of Holocaust survivors have needed more assistance from family members, professionals, organizations, and other entities in order to live their day-to-day lives. Notably, 64% of survivors are more anxious today about the existence of the State of Israel than ever before.\n\nThe surprising response of Holocaust survivors to the question, \"Can we call the events of October 7 a Holocaust?\" struck me as a wake-up call to the government and civil society. Half of the Holocaust survivors who participated in the survey (51%) agreed that the events of October 7 can indeed be called a Holocaust. The fact that more than half of Holocaust survivors share this opinion illustrates how difficult and distressing this period is for them and how much their sense of security has been undermined.\n\nReliving past traumas\n\nThe current war imposes heavy costs on all of us, but the population of Holocaust survivors, whose average age is 86, is a much more vulnerable group. For them, coping is more complex; reliving past traumas is adversely affecting their mental and physical well-being today.\n\nTherefore, I appeal to policymakers and Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Uri Maklev, in charge of the Holocaust Survivors' Rights Authority.\n\nHolocaust survivors cannot wait! Especially these days, when a multi-front war is looming, we must not leave Holocaust survivors alone. The Israeli government urgently needs to promote a national assistance plan to establish a support system that strengthens Holocaust survivors and provides them with comprehensive protection, focusing on physical and mental welfare. Holocaust survivors must feel protected and cared for - an assistance plan will provide them with continuous support tailored to their unique and immediate needs, especially for Holocaust survivors displaced from their homes or residing in high-risk areas.\n\nOur moral obligation as a society is to provide Holocaust survivors with security, protection, home visits by volunteers, and medical teams, and above all else, a listening ear to best provide holistic support for all their needs.\n\nThe writer is CEO of Aviv for Holocaust Survivors.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister's_Office_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister's Office (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special_Needs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Special Needs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/595171", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 298, "textEnd": 307, "freq": 5}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

According to a report on the Times of Israel web site, this day, dedicated to memorializing the six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust, coincides this year with escalating tensions and ongoing violence, casting a stark light on the enduring relevance of such a remembrance.\n\nEstablished in 1951 and legally enshrined later that decade in Israeli law, Yom HaShoah aligns with the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, symbolizing resistance against Nazi oppression. Unlike the United Nations' International Holocaust Remembrance Day observed on January 27, which also aims to educate the global non-Jewish community, Yom HaShoah serves primarily as a day of remembrance within the Jewish community, as was reported by The Times of Israel.\n\nThe significance of Yom HaShoah this year is profound. With the Israel-Hamas conflict now in its seventh month and described as the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust occurring last October 7, the commemoration brings an acute awareness of historical and recent atrocities, as per the information provided in the TOI report. The day's resonance is further amplified by the ongoing captivity of about 132 hostages in Gaza, alongside widespread pro-Hamas and anti-Israel protests across universities in the United States and Europe.\n\nYad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial and museum, hosts an annual ceremony that, this year, takes on heightened significance. Planned under the theme \"A Lost World: The Destruction of Jewish Communities,\" the event prior to the recent conflict now shines a spotlight on the continued threats to Jewish communities globally, as was noted in the TOI report. The ceremony will feature Holocaust survivors lighting six torches, each representing one million of the Holocaust victims, symbolizing both remembrance and the resilience of the Jewish people.\n\nThe global Jewish community, particularly organizations such as Boston's Jewish federation, have expressed that this year marks \"the most significant Yom HaShoah in the last 76 years,\" the report in the TOI said. This statement reflects both the historical weight of the day and the current anti-Semitic crisis impacting Jews worldwide.\n\nAccording to Yad Vashem spokesperson Simmy Allen, this year's theme echoes the harrowing experiences of October 7, the day in which 1200 Israelis were brutally massacred by Hamas terrorists and 250 were taken into captivity in Gaza. This linkage aims to draw parallels between historical and contemporary Jewish experiences of persecution and resilience.\n\nShai Azoulay, Yad Vashem's artist-in-residence, has infused his artwork with themes from the current conflict, attempting to capture the emotional and psychological impact of these events on the Jewish community. According to the TOI report, Azoulay described the recent conflict as a \"sample of the Holocaust,\" emphasizing the profound shock and despair felt by many, likening it to a \"wake-up call\" for the community, reminiscent of historical pogroms.\n\nThe International March of the Living, an annual educational event that brings participants to Auschwitz to remember the Holocaust, has adapted its focus this year to include reflections on recent events. Indicated in the TOI report was that the march will feature 55 Holocaust survivors, among them seven who were directly impacted by the October 7 attacks. This inclusion of \"double-survivors\" -- those who have endured the Holocaust and recent acts of aggression adds a layer of depth to the event, with survivors drawing connections between their experiences.\n\nThis year, the March of the Living has extended invitations to numerous American and Canadian university presidents and chancellors, as they call attention to the educational importance of Holocaust remembrance. The group, led by former Secretary of Education John King, now Chancellor of the State University of New York, and Rabbi Ari Berman, President of Yeshiva University, includes leaders from a diverse array of institutions, as was noted in the TOI report. This initiative sheds light on the commitment to educating future generations about the Holocaust and the importance of combating anti-Semitism.\n\nYU President, Rabbi Ari Berman, emphasized the critical role of educational leaders during this period of crisis. According to Rabbi Berman, this collective act of remembrance by educators is crucial not only in honoring the memory of Holocaust victims but also in strengthening the resolve against modern forms of anti-Semitism and discrimination, from Eastern Europe to U.S. college campuses, the report in the TOI affirmed.\n\nThe Israeli-based AI transcription company Verbit is at the forefront of using technology to preserve Holocaust history. In collaboration with the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, commonly known as the Claims Conference, Verbit has undertaken a monumental project to transcribe Holocaust survivor testimonies, as was reported by the TOI. Their goal is ambitious: to transcribe a total of 8 million minutes of testimony. According to the information provided in the TOI report, there are currently 400,000 minutes of these vital historical records that are accessible and searchable, making them an invaluable resource for educators, scholars, and the public. Verbit is also partnering with Yad Vashem, to transcribe parts of the museum's extensive archives.\n\nThis initiative is particularly impactful following the barbaric massacre on October 7 in Israel, which Verbit notes has illustrated the critical need for preserving firsthand survivor testimonies, the TOI report said. Such efforts ensure that the voices of those who witnessed the horrors of the Nazis continue to educate and inform future generations about the roots and ramifications of anti-Semitism.\n\nThe significance of this year's Yom HaShoah is magnified by a highly significant escalation in anti-Semitism globally, which has spurred a larger turnout at remembrance initiatives and gatherings. These events serve not only as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust but also as a platform for raising awareness about the continuous struggle against visceral Jew hatred.\n\nOne significant project that is gaining traction is spearheaded by the global Jewish organization Olami, in partnership with the Harvey & Gloria Kaylie Foundation, as was noted in the TOI report. This initiative focuses on the personal act of lighting memorial candles for Holocaust victims, a poignant symbol of remembrance and reverence. To facilitate this, the TOI reported that the project offers printable labels for candles dedicated to over 300,000 individual victims, personalizing the act of remembrance.\n\nThis year, in anticipation of an increase in participation, more than 10,000 labeled candles have been distributed across the U.S. and Canada, the TOI report indicated. This widespread distribution ensures that many will hold in their hands a tangible symbol of remembrance, each candle representing a life extinguished too soon but not forgotten.\n\nIn New York, the solemnity of remembrance and the strength of community come together at the Annual Gathering of Remembrance, hosted by Temple Emanuel-El and the Museum of Jewish Heritage. According to the TOI report, this event is a cornerstone of Yom HaShoah commemorations in the city, featuring music, a candle-lighting ceremony, and remarks from prominent Jewish leaders and clergy. This year, New York Representative Jerry Nadler is among the speakers expected to address the gathering, which organizers believe will draw thousands of attendees.\n\nHalfway around the world, in Australia, the klezmer band Chutney has chosen to mark Yom HaShoah through music, sharing their rendition of \"Avinu Malkeinu,\" a prayer that resonates during the High Holidays and at times of communal sorrow. The TOI report said that the band's message to its followers highlighted the profound impact of this year's observance, stating, \"This Yom HaShoah cuts us more deeply than any before,\" a sentiment reflecting renewed pain and resilience in the face of ongoing global anti-Semitism.\n\nEach candle lit, each song sung, and each word spoken during these events serves as a poignant reminder of the atrocities of the Holocaust, the lessons learned, and the vigilance needed to ensure such horrors are never repeated. As the global Jewish community continues to face the challenges stemming from the most egregious and pervasive manifestations of anti-Semitism, these commemorations stand as beacons of hope and action, rooted in the painful lessons of the past.", "source": {"uri": "thejewishvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is observed annually on the 27th of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar, which began at sundown on Sunday and ends at sundown on Monday.\n\nThere was a communitywide Holocaust Remembrance Day commemoration at Holocaust Museum LA in Pan Pacific Park Sunday, marking the 80th anniversary of the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz.\n\nMayor Karen Bass, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Katy Yaroslavsky and Julie Duhaut-Bedos, the French consul general in Los Angeles, were among the speakers.\n\nOther scheduled speakers included 96-year-old Holocaust survivor Mary Bauer, who spent her childhood in Budapest, Hungary, survived Auschwitz, a death march and Ravensbr\u00c3\u00bcck concentration camp, Priscilla Schneider, a daughter of a Holocaust survivor, and Amy Conroy, a granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor.\n\nConroy is scheduled to share the story of her grandfather Nathan Rosenblatt, an Auschwitz survivor, at the museum at 1:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a proclamation on Friday declaring Sunday through May 12 as the \"Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust,\" and called \"upon the people of the United States to observe this week and pause to remember victims and survivors of the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"As United States senator, as vice president, and now as president, I have met with many Holocaust survivors, promising them that our nation would neither forget what they endured nor ever again stand by silently in the face of antisemitism,\" Biden said in the proclamation.\n\n\"The charge has never been more urgent than in the aftermath of Hamas' vicious terrorist attack on October 7th -- the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Among the 1,200 innocent people who were slaughtered and the hundreds taken hostage were elderly survivors of the Shoah, who were forced to relive the horrors they thought they had escaped decades ago.\n\n\"My administration is working tirelessly to free the hostages who have been held by Hamas for over half a year -- and as I have said to their families, we will not rest until we bring them home.\"\n\nBiden also noted the \"alarming surge in antisemitism at home and abroad that resurfaces painful scars of millennia, of antisemitism and hate against the Jewish people,\" including \"harassment and calls for violence against Jews -- in our schools, in our communities and online.\"\n\n\"This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous,\" Biden said. \"Antisemitic hate speech has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere else in our country. As Americans, we cannot stay silent as Jews are attacked, harassed, and targeted.\n\n\"We must also forcefully push back attempts to ignore, deny, distort, or revise the history of Nazi atrocities during the Holocaust or Hamas' murders and other atrocities committed on October 7th -- including the appalling and unforgivable use of rape and sexual assault to terrorize and torture Jewish women and girls.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki",

The event recreates the 2-mile (3-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were slaughtered by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who has turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked near the Jewish calendar anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited at the Knesset. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year will include an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 and a half years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Mefalsim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Mefalsim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn October 7, Tzamir faced the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas terrorists poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Mefalsim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where terrorists burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe terrorists killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 252. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to the Hamas-run local health ministry -- a figure that cannot be independently verified, and includes some 13,000 Hamas gunmen Israel says it has killed in battle. Israel also says it killed some 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7.\n\nIsrael's offensive has driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes, and hunger conditions in the Strip approach famine, according to United Nations officials. South Africa has lodged a genocide allegation against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Mefalsim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas terrorists outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Mefalsim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 other Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Mefalsim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Mefalsim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv for the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the October 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nTzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate from their homes due to the war in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates that 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Mefalsim, which is situated just a mile (1.4 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate over the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old. I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said as her husband Ran busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "southern_israel@timesofisrael.com", "name": "Southern Israel", "type":

What else is necessary for you to go home? Let the people of Israel remember their abandoned sons,\" a reference to the hostages Hamas holds in Gaza.\n\nAddressing the ceremony, Netanyahu drew a parallel between Hamas's October 7 attack and the Holocaust.\n\n\"Let me clarify, the terror attack was not a Holocaust, but not because the intention was different. It's the same. Hamas is driven by the same goals as the Nazis,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nVowing to bring the hostages home, Netanyahu added, \"We are committed to putting an end to this ongoing menace. We will fight against the monsters of Hamas until the organization is eradicated. I say monsters, not only because of their atrocious acts but because they revel in them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, President Isaac Herzog drew attention to Holocaust survivor Alex Danzig, who is among the captives in Gaza.\n\nThe 75-year-old Danzig was born in Warsaw and settled in Kibbutz Nir Oz.

Israelis customarily stand still, including cars stopping on the road, to honor the memory of the six million Jews slain by the Nazis and their helpers.\n\nThe siren was activated by Holocaust survivor Malkah Herman, 92, and her grandson Maor, an officer in the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command, the military announced.\n\n\"During this period, when we are witnessing many threats to the State of Israel and the Jewish people, I was given the privilege to take part in commemorating the memory and heroism of our brothers and sisters who were murdered in the Holocaust,\" Herman said in a statement.\n\n\"Being here, alongside my grandson, brings me huge excitement and reminds me of the road I went through to get here and gives me pride in the family I founded -- thanks to, and despite everything,\" she added.\n\nThe various government agencies and the Knesset held ceremonies on Monday, attended by the president, prime minister and members of the Knesset.\n\nAt the Knesset ceremony, titled \"Everyone Has a Name,\" President Isaac Herzog listed the names of the family members of two hostages currently held in Gaza who were killed in the Holocaust. The hostages, Alex Danzig and Mattan Angrest, come from families of those killed and those who survived and made their lives in Israel.\n\n\"This year, piece by piece, we were broken, and our eyes saw sights we never thought we would see again, as a free nation in its own country,\" Herzog said.\n\n\"The wounds of October 7 are still open in our hearts, we are grieving and grieving, and we will not be able to remain silent as long as our brothers and sisters are kidnapped by Hamas murderers.\"\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also addressed the ceremony, saying the difference between the Nazi horrors and the attack of Oct. 7 \"is that we have heroic soldiers, hundreds of whom fell with endless bravery and others were wounded, and we embrace them and the families of the fallen and the kidnapped in our hearts.\n\n\"It was not a Holocaust because we have this protective force, and the difference is really expressed in the fact that we had nothing like that in the Holocaust. The scale of the carnage in the Holocaust is unimaginable, it is equivalent to 5,000 times October 7.\"\n\nLikud lawmaker Yuli Edelstein said at the Knesset ceremony, \"Six million of our people were slaughtered in the Holocaust. Each of them is a complete world, each of them is a link in the chain of generations of the Jewish people.\n\n\"But there are those who survived the inferno and in each survivor -- six million souls lived inside him. In each survivor we lived together, side by side, the pain of six million victims alongside the hopes of a thousand-year-old witness,\" he added.\n\nAt the ceremony, Knesset member Almog Cohen lit a memorial candle with his grandfather, Ben Zion Hadad, who was a survivor of the Nazi death camps.\n\nAlso on Monday, Michal Woldiger, a Knesset member from the Religious Zionism Party, tweeted that her father-in-law, Nachman, a Holocaust survivor, died at the age of 88.\n\nThe chairman of her party, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, sent her condolences on X.\n\nSmotrich also held an event at the Finance Ministry, where Miriam Man Shathai, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, shared her parents' story about survival and finding a new life in the Land of Israel.\n\nHolocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day is marked on the 27th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan and commemorates the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, one of the notable cases of Jewish defiance in the face of Nazi murder during the Holocaust.\n\nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, which is observed in Israel but not as widely, marks the date that Auschwitz was liberated in 1945.", "source": {"uri":

The day will also be marked by services at schools, military bases, and other public institutions.\n\nThis year, however, Yom HaShoah takes on added symbolism.\n\nIt arrives in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 onslaught, which resulted in the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. With as many as 100 hostages still held in Gaza and rising antisemitism globally, this year's commemoration carries a heightened sense of urgency and remembrance.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized the importance of remembering the Holocaust's lessons and defending against present-day threats.\n\n\"If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us,\" Netanyahu stated. \"Therefore, we will defend ourselves in every way. We will overcome our enemies and ensure our security - in the Gaza Strip, on the Lebanese border, everywhere.\"\n\nReflecting on the significance of this year's Yom HaShoah, Yad Vashem spokesperson Simmy Allen noted how the theme of \"A Lost World: The Destruction of Jewish Communities\" has taken on new meaning in light of recent events.\n\n\"This year's Yom HaShoah is particularly poignant as we remember not only the victims of the Holocaust but also those who have suffered in recent attacks,\" said Allen. \"The resilience of survivors serves as a beacon of hope and strength in the face of adversity.\"\n\nIn addition to traditional commemorations, the International March of the Living, an annual educational pilgrimage to Auschwitz, has adapted its approach this year.\n\nLed by 55 Holocaust survivors, including some affected by the Oct. 7 attacks, the march aims to honor the memory of the Holocaust victims and educate participants about the horrors of the past. University presidents and chancellors from the United States and Canada will also participate, underscoring the importance of Holocaust education and remembrance.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden also reflected on the solemn occasion, proclaiming May 5 through May 12, 2024, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust.\n\n\"During Yom Hashoah and these days of remembrance, we mourn the six million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered in the Holocaust,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We honor the memories of the victims, the courage of the survivors, and the heroism of those who stood up to the Nazis, and we recommit ourselves to making real the promise of 'Never Again.'\"", "source": {"uri": "i24news.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "i24NEWS

But in Beeri, it was the first time that I felt the fear of death.\"\n\nA neighboring house was riddled with bullets. Louz's was untouched. He says he imagined the souls of the six million Holocaust victims steering Hamas away from him. \"They probably wanted me to be here to tell this story,\" he said, weeping.\n\nOther Holocaust survivors participating in the March of the Living include Smil Bercu Sacagiu, 87, whose home was hit by a rocket from Gaza, and Jacqueline Gliksman, 81, whose home was torched by a Palestinian infiltrator.\n\n\"What was left, and luckily the terrorist didn't see it, is my grandchildren,\" she said, referring to gold figurines on a necklace she was wearing. \"That's the only thing I have left.\"\n\nBefore he was seized, Haim's grandson left a text message: \"They're burning down my house. I smell gas. I'm scared.\"\n\nShe said that it reminded her of a Holocaust-era song in Yiddish, invoking centuries of pogroms, with the refrain \"fire, Jews, fire.\" A veteran campaigner for peace with the Palestinians, Haim said she would no longer pursue that activism.\n\n\"I'm not able to,\" she said. \"Now what interests me is only my people.\"", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish holidays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "March of the Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eucharist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yiddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pogrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/414235", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 341, "textEnd": 347, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Many Jewish students have felt intimidated by protests, which have at times included antisemitic tropes and calls for anti-Jewish violence.\n\nA small group of pro-Palestinian protesters waving Palestinian flags stood along the side of the road as participants marched with Israeli flags from the site of Auschwitz in the Polish town of Oswiecim to the site of Birkenau about 3 kilometers (2 miles) away. The area was under German occupation during World War II and today the former death camps are preserved as memorials by the Polish state.\n\n\"Through this protest we want to say that we bow down to the victims of the Holocaust too,\" said Omar Faris, president of an association of Palestinians in Poland. \"At the same time, we demand an end to war, an end to genocide.\"\n\nThe march took place on what is Holocaust Remembrance Day in the Jewish calendar. A grim landscape of watchtowers and barracks were filled with the blue and white of Israeli flags, a celebration of Jewish survival at the place of genocide.\n\nPeople walk through the former Nazi German death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau as they attend the annual Holocaust remembrance event, the \"March of the Living\" in memory of the six million Holocaust victims in Oswiecim, Poland, Monday, May 6, 2024.

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski)\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive also joined.\n\nJudith Tzamir, a Holocaust survivor from Germany who moved to Israel in 1964, had long avoided visiting Auschwitz. But she was inspired to join this year's march after her kibbutz fended off an attack by Hamas on Oct. 7\n\n\"See, I try not to remember it all the time. But on the 7th of October they brought me the remembrance very, very harshly back,\" she told The Associated Press at the site of the former death camp. \"And that\u00b4s the moment when I decided, OK, this is the time you should go to Auschwitz to see it.\"\n\nAmid the backdrop of pro-Palestinian protests that have roiled American campuses, Rabbi Ari Berman, president of Yeshiva University in New York, led a delegation of leaders from Catholic, Evangelical and historically Black colleges and universities.\n\n\"The message here is clear. The dangers of allowing hate to go unchecked are real. And we don\u00b4t need to get to the cattle cars in order for it to be unconscionable and unacceptable,\" he said, referring to the cattle cars used to transport Jews to their deaths at camps under German wartime occupation.\n\nHe said it was essential for university leaders \"to call out, and in no uncertain terms, when there is intimidation and hate and antisemitism. We\u00b4re seeing it on campuses and college campuses, and it needs to have a response.\"\n\nSome who had planned to attend had to cancel to deal with the protests at home, Berman told the AP, though he did not name them.\n\nVanessa Gera reported from Warsaw.\n\nPeople walk through the former Nazi German death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau as they attend the annual Holocaust remembrance event, the \"March of the Living\" in memory of the six million Holocaust victims in Oswiecim, Poland, Monday, May 6, 2024.

A grim landscape of watchtowers and barracks was filled with the blue and white of Israeli flags, a celebration of Jewish survival at the place of genocide.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians.

(WKRN) -- In Israel and across the U.S., commemorations are taking place for Holocaust Remembrance Day, known in Hebrew as Yom HaShoah.\n\nNearly 80 years after the Holocaust, many are honoring the memories of those killed by looking to the past.\n\nWhen Holocaust Remembrance Day began Sunday evening, nearly 100 Jews in Nashville gathered and lit memorial candles to pay tribute to the innocent victims. Frances Hahn, the city's last living Holocaust survivor, was present at the event and was visibly emotional, reflecting on the tragedies that took place when she was just a young child.\n\nFelicia Anchor, chair of the National Holocaust Memorial, estimated the area once had around 50 survivors.\n\nThe names of Nashville's Holocaust victims are listed on the memorial in Bellevue. Those in charge of the site told News 2 that it serves as concrete evidence of their existence and the tragedies they faced. They said it was built to be a place for Nashvillians to pay their respects to their loved ones, many of whom don't have graves. It's also an educational opportunity being the only location that makes the history and lessons of the Holocaust available to the general public in Middle Tennessee.\n\nThis year's day of mourning comes almost seven months after Hamas committed the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), American Jews experienced an unprecedented amount of anti-Semitic incidents in 2023, an increase of 140% from 2022 and the highest level recorded since the organization started tracking this data in 1979. The ADL Audit of Antisemitic Incidents also recorded a dramatic spike of 5,204 anti-Semitic acts following the Oct. 7 massacre.\n\nDov Wilker, director of the American Jewish Committee's Southeast region, said it's concerning to see stark similarities in the hatred Jews were facing during World War II being echoed today.\n\n\"Unfortunately, more than ever, people are denying what has happened to the Jewish people; people are denying what happened on Oct. 7, the sexual violence that Hamas committed against women in Israel, the fact that people were questioning that Oct. 7 even happened, as well as Israel's right and responsibility to defend itself,\" Wilker said. \"For the Jewish people, Yom HaShoah is an important reminder of all that we have been through and all that we are dealing with today.\"\n\nIt's the strength of the Jewish community of the present that Wilker said gives him hope for a better future.\n\n\"As the Jewish people continue to grow and thrive, we are reminded on Yom HaShoah that the story of being massacred is not the end of our story,\" Wilker said. \"Jewish history has taught us that people will always try to destroy us; people will always try to get rid of us, but our resiliency as a people has enabled us to thrive for over 2,000 years.\"", "source": {"uri": "wkrn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKRN News 2"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaxie_pidgeon@wkrn.com", "name": "Jaxie Pidgeon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jewish_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Jewish Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.wkrn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2024/05/IMG_8910.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1729, "textEnd": 1735, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The march took place at the largest concentration camp during World War II, where the Nazis killed an estimated 1 million Jews in a less than five year period. Thousands of others were also killed, according to estimates.\n\n\"Through this protest we want to say that we bow down to the victims of the Holocaust too,\" Omar Faris, head of an organization of Palestinians in Poland, said, according to The Associated Press. \"At the same time, we demand an end to war, an end to genocide.\"\n\nIsraeli hostages released by Hamas and those with relatives held captive in Gaza participated in the 36th annual march, according to AP. A Holocaust survivor named Judith Tzamir reportedly visited Auschwitz for the first time following the Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which marked the deadliest attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Protesters have chanted antisemitic slurs and have blocked Jewish students from going to class.\n\nPolice departments across the U.S. have arrested hundreds of protesters as they engaged in violence with law enforcement and refused their calls to break apart their encampments. The New York Police Department (NYPD) arrested 113 individuals during a single protest at Columbia University held on April 18, according to ABC News 7.\n\nA mob of roughly 200 protesters smashed into a window of Columbia University's Hamilton Hall and barricaded the building. They allegedly held three janitors hostage in the process, a source told the Columbia Spectator.\n\nThe Texas Department of Safety (DPS) and the Austin Police Department arrested multiple people people during an April 24 protest at the University of Texas-Austin.

When she met with children from Kibbutz Mefalsim,one of the 22 communities near the Gaza border ravaged during the assault, she told them that they were not alone, and that this trauma also could be overcome.\n\n\"The children asked me how I survived, and I told them: 'Just like you.

She said that her role as an educator and survivor has changed since Oct. 7, as she faced \"audiences that are thirsty\" for optimism.\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, an Israeli national holiday, stretches from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday. It is the first of a string of holidays over the next two weeks that are overshadowed by the Oct. 7 attacks -- the deadliest assault in Israeli history and the most recent formative tragedy to befall the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\n\nNext week will be Memorial Day and Independence Day, which are expected to surface long-simmering controversies over the handling of the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition maintain that, above all, Hamas must be destroyed, while hostage families and their supporters say the priority must be the return of their loved ones.\n\nOn Sunday, hundreds of Holocaust survivors gathered with younger generations to share their testimonies, in living rooms and public spaces around the country, as part of a 13-year-old initiative that was originally envisioned as a means of keeping their stories alive as the survivor population dwindles.\n\nBut on Monday, as the blare of sirens brought Israelis to a standstill, the directive to \"Never Forget\" -- said of the Holocaust, and of Oct. 7, and in some cases both -- was imbued with new, more urgent relevance, according to Israeli survivors.\n\n\"It is not simple, this forging of connecting between this screaming present,\" of the hostages, whose families have for seven months been clamoring for their release, \"and the memory of our grandparents, who require us to be worthy of their memory,\" said Benny Lau, a prominent rabbi who hosted the Hostage Square Holocaust Remembrance Day event.\n\nSurvivors and their hundreds of thousands of grandchildren in Israel say that the current situation feels like the Holocaust.\n\n\"I feel like we are living in something we might call an 'October Holocaust,' \" said Omri Shtivi, whose brother Idan, a 28-year-old environmental sciences student from Tel Aviv, was kidnapped from the Nova party. Omri said that both their grandparents were Holocaust survivors and that the testimonies he discovered in anticipation of the holiday were \"chilling\" in their relevance.\n\n\"This is a much lower scale, but I think that anyone who has seen the pictures from that Saturday cannot call it anything else,\" he said.\n\nIsrael is home to 133,000 Holocaust survivors, some 2,000 of whom were evacuated from their homes because of the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs.\n\nOn Monday, their plights and their names are being remembered as the war in Gaza could be entering a new phase. Negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal are again at an impasse. On Sunday, Hamas launched a rocket attack on the Kerem Shalom border crossing, one of the few land routes for the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Strip, killing four Israeli soldiers.\n\nThere are 132 hostages still inside Gaza, most of whom Israel believes to be held in homes and subterranean tunnels in Rafah, the southern city that Israel has pinpointed as its final battlefield. On Monday, Israel issued evacuation orders to some 100,000 residents of Rafah, potentially signaling that a ground incursion is imminent. More than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nThe International Criminal Court in The Hague is rumored to be preparing arrest warrants for senior Israeli government and military officials, including Netanyahu, over their conduct of the war. The International Court of Justice, a separate body, is also considering a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has categorically denied the accusations, saying that its military takes measures to protect civilian life and that the war is necessary for the country's survival.\n\n\"Eighty years ago, in the Holocaust, the Jewish people were totally defenseless against those who sought our destruction. No nation came to our aid,\" Netanyahu said Sunday night, speaking in English at the official opening Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, where an empty yellow chair was reserved as a gesture of solidarity with the hostages in Gaza.\n\n\"I say to the leaders of the world -- no amount of pressure, no decision from any international forum will stop Israel from defending itself,\" he added, apparently referring to the ICC proceedings and the international critics of the war in Gaza. \"We will defeat our genocidal enemies. Never again is now.\"\n\nZili Wenkert, 88, who survived the Transnistria concentration camp and whose 22-year-old grandson, Omer, is a hostage in Gaza, said she felt \"enormous disappointment\" at the Israeli war aim to annihilate Hamas.\n\n\"I'm not a military person, but I know that the first thing that they need to do is to let the hostages go, because we cannot destroy all the terror that is in their hearts,\" she said, referring to Hamas. \"No. First release all the hostages. God knows how many are alive.\"\n\nShe last saw Omer in a video sent to the family on the morning of Oct. 7, showing him stripped to his underwear, handcuffed, lying inside an SUV. Omer has colitis, a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that flares under stress. The family does not know if he has received any of the medicines that were supposed to have entered the Gaza Strip months ago, earmarked for the hostages. They do not know if he is alive.\n\n\"My grandson in the hands of Hamas -- it is something I cannot process,\" said Wenkert. \"This is my real Holocaust.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com",

But he also says he remains committed to an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite widespread international opposition because of the more than 1 million civilians huddled there.\n\n\"I say to the leaders of the world: No amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum will stop Israel from defending itself,\" he said. \"Never again is now.\"\n\nYom Hashoah, the day Israel observes as a memorial for the 6 million Jews killed by Nazi Germany and its allies in the Holocaust, is one of the most solemn dates on the country's calendar. Speeches at the ceremony generally avoid politics, though Netanyahu in recent years has used the occasion to lash out at Israel's archenemy Iran.\n\nThe ceremony ushered in Israel's first Holocaust remembrance day since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that sparked the war, imbuing the already somber day with additional meaning.\n\nHamas militants killed some 1,200 people in the attack, making it the deadliest violence against Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nIsrael responded with an air and ground offensive in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and about 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people are displaced. The death and destruction has prompted South Africa to file a genocide case against Israel in the U.N.'s world court. Israel strongly rejects the charges.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu attacked those accusing Israel of carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians, claiming that Israel was doing everything possible to ensure the entry of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe 24-hour memorial period began after sundown on Sunday with a ceremony at Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial, in Jerusalem.\n\nThere are approximately 245,000 living Holocaust survivors around the world, according to the Claims Conference, an organization that negotiates for material compensation for Holocaust survivors. Approximately half of the survivors live in Israel.\n\nOn Sunday, Tel Aviv University and the Anti-Defamation League released an annual Antisemitism Worldwide Report for 2023, which found a sharp increase in antisemitic attacks globally.\n\nIt said the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States doubled, from 3,697 in 2022 to 7,523 in 2023.\n\nWhile most of these incidents occurred after the war erupted in October, the number of antisemitic incidents, which include vandalism, harassment, assault, and bomb threats, from January to September was already significantly higher than the previous year.\n\nThe report found an average of three bomb threats per day at synagogues and Jewish institutions in the U.S., more than 10 times the number in 2022.\n\nOther countries tracked similar rises in antisemitic incidents. In France, the number nearly quadrupled, from 436 in 2022 to 1,676 in 2023, while it more than doubled in the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\n\"In the aftermath of the October 7 war crimes committed by Hamas, the world has seen the worst wave of antisemitic incidents since the end of the Second World War,\" the report stated.\n\nNetanyahu also compared the recent wave of protests on American campuses to German universities in the 1930s, in the runup to the Holocaust. He condemned the \"explosion of a volcano of antisemitism spitting out boiling lava of lies against us around the world.\"\n\nNearly 2,500 students have been arrested in a wave of protests at U.S. college campuses, while there have been smaller protests in other countries, including France. Protesters reject antisemitism accusations and say they are criticizing Israel. Campuses and the federal government are struggling to define exactly where political speech crosses into antisemitism.", "source": {"uri": "wowktv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WOWK 13

Pro-Palestine activists converge on Auschwitz on Holocaust Remembrance Day", "body": "The annual march on Holocaust Remembrance Day was twisted by pro-Palestinian protesters who gathered outside of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp on Monday as Jewish supporters gathered for the \" March of the Living.\"\n\nAs the solemn walk was held, the protesters, waving Palestinian flags, reportedly heckled the Jewish survivors, according to the Daily Mail.\n\n\"Sirens wailed as protestors displayed a banner reading 'stop genocide' at groups wearing Israeli flags along the sidelines of the event, which brings together thousands annually to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day in silence,\" the Daily Mail reported.\n\n\"Eyewitnesses claimed protestors were 'chanting' at participants on the march, with Israelis responding with lines from 'Am Israel chai', a Jewish solidarity anthem,\" the media outlet added.\n\nSurvivors of the October 7 attack by Hamas were also in attendance. The group walked two miles from Auschwitz to Birkenau where roughly one million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis in the Second World War.\n\n\"An Israeli participant who approached the demonstrators was pushed back by a member of the security detail. 'I feel immense anger,'\" he told Ynet. \"'If we thought never again, we received another blow to the head at Auschwitz with the realization that what was done to Jews on this cursed land, could be repeated especially after October 7. I face them fearless and proud with our national flag,'\" Ynet News reported.\n\n\"Just last week, distressing footage invoked fury as a man filmed himself walking through the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Auschwitz and saying: 'You belong here. This is your place of origin. You left these camps and ghettos. Long live Palestine,'\" the Daily Mail noted.\n\n\"Last week, a man was detained in Poland 'in connection to' the hurling of Molotov cocktails at the only Synagogue to have survived the Holocaust, an attack that drew ire from Polish officials and Jewish leaders,\" the outlet recounted. \"Photos showed the aftermath of the attack on the No\u017cyk Synagogue.\"\n\nIsrael is readying an attack on Rafah where the final holdouts of Hamas are likely dug in. On Monday, 100,000 people were told to evacuate the city by Israel, enraging Palestinians and their supporters worldwide.\n\n\"We marched today to give a voice to the six million victims of the Nazis' industrial genocide of the Jewish people. We marched with survivors of the Nazi atrocities as well as survivors of Hamas' crimes and families of those still held in captivity,\" the International March of the Living said in a statement.\n\n\"The half a dozen protestors who perversely saw this as an opportunity to voice hatred against Israel and the Jewish people serve as a timely reminder of the importance of Holocaust education and remembrance and of teaching the dangers of hatred and extremism,\" the statement continued.\n\nThis is the 36th year the event has been held. Thousands typically attend it including Holocaust survivors, Jewish students, leaders, and politicians.\n\n\"Fifty-six survivors of the Shoah are expecting to take part in the march alongside an anticipated 10,000 others traveling from across the world to observe the date. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march,\" the Daily Mail reported.\n\nAntisemitism is rising across Europe over the Hamas war and pro-Palestinian protesters are demanding a ceasefire while Israel is determined to defeat Hamas.\n\nIsrael Katz, the country's Minister of Foreign Affairs, called Hamas a \"Nazi terrorist organization\" on Monday in a post on X marking Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\n\"Israel has agreed to significant concessions to bring the hostages home, but Hamas has repeatedly refused. Everyone understands that [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar has no intention of releasing all hostages, even in exchange for everything,\" Katz wrote.\n\n\"He believes that the world will pressure Israel to stop the war unconditionally, and he will be able to continue to control Gaza - with hostages as bargaining chips and with the ability to continue the attrition war against Israel and plan the next attack. Today, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, the slogan 'Never Again' takes on a special meaning. The people of Israel say: 'Never again,'\" he declared.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

The event recreates the 2-mile (3-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "March of the Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi concentration camps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliyah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 80, "textEnd": 86, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This tragedy is one of the most horrific events in human history.\n\nOn this day of remembrance and introspection, we vow never to forget the victims of the Holocaust. More than 6 million Jewish men, women and children were tortured, persecuted and murdered by the Nazi regime and its followers. Half a million Roma and other members of minority and vulnerable communities, including persons with disabilities, suffered the same fate. This very dark chapter of the past carries intergenerational trauma for people in many countries, including Canada.\n\nYom HaShoah is a time to honour the memory of Holocaust victims and offer support to their descendants. We commend the people who work every day to ensure that the Holocaust and its devastating effects are never denied, minimized, distorted or forgotten. The Government of Canada is committed to fighting the rise in antisemitism and Holocaust denial. This includes allocating over $273 million as part of Budget 2024 towards Canada's forthcoming first-ever Action Plan on Hate, which includes funding to support the mandate of the Special Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combatting Antisemitism. Budget 2024 also commits to creating a new national Holocaust remembrance program to support projects that keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and improve understanding and attitudes toward the Holocaust and antisemitism.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about the Shoah and its repercussions, discover the stories of those who survived and those who did not, and reflect on the prejudice and hatred that caused these atrocities. Together, let's continue to choose the road of courageous leadership.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lyon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgenerational trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romani people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Likewise, Israel supporters, including members of the government, have liberally used the N-word to describe the actions of Hamas and of Iran.\n\nBoth sides use the term 'genocide'\n\nAnd, of course, both sides have latched on to the term \"genocide,\" as if it actually has any semblance of similarities between what is happening now between Israel and Hamas and what took place in the Holocaust.\n\nThese loose words have to stop. The Holocaust was a singular moment, the depths of depravity and inhumanity it evoked unmatched in the annals of history. Conflating it with the current war is a ghoulish travesty that cheapens the memory of the six million.\n\nThey, and the survivors of the Shoah - whose numbers are dwindling each year - must be the focus of everyone's attention on Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nAs Eve Young reported in Sunday's Post, Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2024 is \"more important than ever because of the hope and strength that can be found in the stories of survivors,\" according to the organization Zikaron BaSalon (Remembrance in the Living Room), which organizes meetings in which survivors address small groups in homes.\n\n\"This year, we want to give hope and inspiration through the stories of Holocaust survivors... to gain strength from them, and to learn from them how to get up from the deepest depths,\" said Moran Zipper Goldenberg, co-CEO of Zikaron BaSalon.\n\nAt this low point our history, the words of the remaining survivors are a testament to the determination of the Jewish people to face monumental challenges - and to not only retain their humanity, but to flourish. That should be what we glean from this year's commemoration.\n\nAnother lesson to remember this Holocaust Remembrance Day was stated eloquently on Sunday by IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi.\n\n\"The State of Israel was established, among other things, thanks to the soldiers from across generations, who were willing to sacrifice their lives for it. These days, we are in a war where, at its onset, we failed in our mission and lost many... entire lives were cut short in their prime in a war that was also thrust upon us by a wicked enemy who rose up to destroy us,\" he said.\n\n\"But this time, we are different.

It was one of the darkest chapters in human history, and in that sense the unimaginable cruelty and profound sense of loss and grief present during the Holocaust and in our collective memories will never leave us.\n\nThis year, Yom HaShoah comes at a time when Jewish communities are still reeling from the brutal terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas against Israel on October 7 - the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust - and the disturbing rise in anti-Semitism that followed in Canada and around the world. Canada unequivocally condemns the Hamas attacks, the glorification of these indefensible acts and the unacceptable acts of anti-Semitism that have targeted the Canadian Jewish community.\n\nToday, we must remember, but we must also learn, educate others and renew our eternal obligation never to let such events happen again.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau today introduced $90.5 million in Budget 2024 measures to combat anti-Semitism, preserve Holocaust remembrance, raise awareness of Holocaust denial and distortion, and protect Jewish gathering places.\n\nHere are the proposed measures:\n\nCreate a new permanent national Holocaust remembrance program. Budget 2024 invests $5 million to support initiatives that will preserve the memory of the Holocaust for future generations, and help more Canadians learn about the atrocities committed at the time and the prevalence of anti-Semitism that caused them.\n\nSupporting the construction of the new Montreal Holocaust Museum. The Government of Canada will invest $5 million to help build this museum, which aims to educate a new generation of visitors, including students, about the horrors and injustices of the Holocaust. These funds are in addition to a previous investment of $20 million in support of this project, and are part of a range of generational investments supporting the modernization of major Holocaust institutions in Canada. For example, $2.5 million will go to the Toronto Holocaust Museum, and $25 million to the construction of a new Jewish Community Centre in Greater Vancouver, which will house the expansion of the Vancouver Holocaust Memorial Centre.\n\nStrengthen our support for Canada's Special Envoy for Holocaust Remembrance and the Fight Against Anti-Semitism. Budget 2024 proposes $7.3 million to help Special Envoy Deborah Lyons contribute to building a more inclusive society and ensure that current and future Jewish populations can feel safe at home and abroad. These funds are in addition to the $5.6 million over 5 years, starting in 2022-2023, that was earmarked in Budget 2022.\n\nProtecting communities from hate crimes. Budget 2024 announces $41.2 million to improve the collection and availability of hate crime data in Canada; to help police colleges strengthen hate crime management training; and to develop and deliver specialized training for Crown prosecutors to sensitize the judiciary to the unique dynamics of hate crime. If we have the right data, and if law enforcement, prosecutors and judges are trained to prevent and crack down on hate crimes, we can improve our ability to combat this hatred on all fronts.\n\nProtecting synagogues and cultural sites. As part of Canada's Action Plan to Combat Hate, Budget 2024 proposes $32 million through the Security Infrastructure Funding Program to increase security in gathering places such as synagogues, day schools and community centers. As a result, at-risk communities will be protected from hate crimes, including Jewish communities. In addition, we will cut red tape and evolve the Security Infrastructure Funding Program to make it easier and more efficient for organizations to access security support when they need it.\n\nLaunch a review to evaluate and renew Canada's National Holocaust Monument. Using existing resources, the federal government will work with Holocaust scholars, education experts and the local community to raise the profile and awareness of the Monument in Ottawa, Ontario and across the country.\n\nOur message to Jewish Canadians is this: we are with you. Our solidarity is unwavering. And our commitment to your safety is ironclad. Whether they're in their synagogue, a Jewish business or school, wearing a Star of David or a yarmulke, Jewish Canadians deserve to feel safe, supported and welcomed. They deserve to live their lives proudly and openly, without intimidation or fear.\n\nWe will take all necessary steps to raise awareness of the Holocaust, fight anti-Semitism and combat hatred in all its forms, and these are just some of the measures we are proposing in Budget 2024 to build a more equitable and inclusive country for all. On the occasion of Yom HaShoah, Canada reaffirms its solidarity with Jewish communities to ensure that this dark chapter in history is never repeated.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"We stand in solidarity with Jewish Canadians - on Yom HaShoah and every day. We must stand together, remember the consequences of hatred, educate others and renew our efforts to eliminate anti-Semitism. Jewish Canadians deserve to live their lives proudly and openly, without intimidation or fear.\"\n\n\"It's not enough to say 'never again'. In this year's budget, we are making investments and taking tangible steps to combat anti-Semitism, hatred and intolerance in all its forms - while reaffirming our commitment to stand in solidarity with Jewish Canadians.\"\n\n\"Anti-Semitism has no place in Canada. The investments in Budget 2024 will help educate current and future generations of Canadians so that the horrors of the Holocaust are never forgotten and we always fight anti-Semitism and all forms of hatred.\"\n\n\"We must never forget the testimonies, the families and the legacy of those who lost their lives in the Holocaust. It's painful, but essential. This story must be told in our museums, through our monuments and in our community spaces, to inspire us to continually reflect so that this kind of event never happens again. Sadly, hatred, fear, persecution and anti-Semitism still exist today. We must address them every day. Today, generations of Jewish Canadians and Jewish people around the world are remembering. And by taking concrete action, in a spirit of solidarity, we stand with them.\"\n\n\"Yom HaShoah reminds us that it's up to all of us to ensure that the promise of 'never again' is kept. There is much work to be done so that Canadian Jewish communities can not only feel safe, but also be able to thrive. Younger generations in all communities across Canada must be educated about the dangers associated with Holocaust denial, distortion and inversion, and all Canadians must renew their commitment to combating the anti-Semitism we witness today at home and around the world.\"\n\nHighlights\n\nIn all, Budget 2024 proposes funding of $273.6 million over six years, starting in 2024-2025, and $29.3 million thereafter, for Canada's Action Plan to Combat Hate, to support community outreach and law enforcement reform, combat radicalization and increase support for victims of discrimination and violence.\n\nSince 2018-2019, Canada has invested more than $260 million in Canada's Anti-Racism Strategy, Canada's Action Plan to Combat Hate and the Canadian Race Relations Foundation to combat racism and hate, to continue enriching our society with Canada's remarkable diversity.\n\nEarlier this year, the government introduced the Online Hate Act, which will combat the significant increase in online hate directed at vulnerable populations, such as the Jewish community. In addition, this legislation creates new provisions and strengthens existing provisions in the Criminal Code to ensure that perpetrators of hate crimes are held accountable for their actions.\n\nThe position of Special Envoy for Holocaust Remembrance and the Fight against Anti-Semitism was created in 2020 as part of the federal government's commitment to strengthen national and international efforts to preserve Holocaust remembrance and survivor testimonies. The Special Envoy works to combat anti-Semitism, hatred and racism, and to promote and defend democracy, pluralism, inclusion and human rights.\n\nCanada's commitment to human rights and the fight against anti-Semitism at home and abroad is rooted in our membership and collaboration with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). As the only international institution with a primary mandate to address Holocaust-related issues, the IAHM promotes awareness of the far-reaching negative impact of anti-Semitism around the world, and seeks ways to put an end to it. In June 2022, Canada announced that it would double its annual contribution to the IAHM.\n\nIn 2019, the Government of Canada adopted the AIMH definition of anti-Semitism. An accompanying guide is being drafted and will be made public this year.\n\nIn 2022, the government amended the Criminal Code of Canada to make it an indictable offence to wilfully promote anti-Semitism by condoning, denying or minimizing the Holocaust.\n\nThe Government of Canada's Budget 2024 was tabled in the House of Commons by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance on April 16, 2024.\n\nRelated links\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

The event recreates the 2-mile (3-kilometer) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately 1 million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most somber days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Mefalsim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Mefalsim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Mefalsim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Mefalsim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Mefalsim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometers of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Mefalsim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Mefalsim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the Oct. 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nTzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate from their homes due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates that 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Mefalsim, just a mile (1.4 kilometers) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate over the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said as her husband Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the spelling of the kibbutz is Mefalsim.", "source": {"uri": "greenfieldreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greenfield Daily Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They too are a part of the history of the Holocaust.\"\n\nThe March of the Living, a cornerstone event on Holocaust Remembrance Day, saw thousands of students and dignitaries march alongside Holocaust survivors, commemorating the immense loss suffered by humanity.\n\nSince 1988, over 300,000 participants have honored this solemn occasion by marching from Auschwitz I to Auschwitz II-Birkenau.\n\nFor Jewish students, this march in Poland was part of a broader journey culminating in a celebratory Independence Day March in Jerusalem.

It will also show Assaf Lapid's fascinating, award-winning documentary The Return from the Other Planet, about the mysterious writer who called himself Ka-Tzetnik, whose pulp fiction novels about Auschwitz mesmerized and sometimes scandalized generations.\n\nYes Docu and Hot 8 will show a number of new documentaries, including The Jewish Nazi?, which tells the bizarre story of Alex Kurzem, a survivor who escaped the massacre of his family's shtetl in Belarus in 1941. He was captured by a Latvian battalion, who gave him a uniform and a gun and made him their child mascot. The Jewish Nazi? is based on Kurzem's bestselling book, The Mascot, and it traces his journey to Australia with his adopted Latvian family.\n\nThese channels will also show the documentary series Hitler's Handmaidens, which tells how some German women played a much more central role in the Holocaust than previously thought.\n\nYes will show many feature films on its Yes Cinematheque channel, including Laszlo Nemes's Oscar-winning Son of Saul, one of the most graphic and accurate dramatic films about the Holocaust ever made, (and which will also be shown on CellcomTV), as well as Alan J. Pakula's Sophie's Choice, which stars Meryl Streep in an Oscar-winning performance as a gentile concentration-camp survivor in a relationship with an American Jew, played by Kevin Kline. Michel Kichka's animated film My Father's Secrets, about the son of an Auschwitz survivor, will premiere on Yes VOD and CellcomTV, and is highly recommended.\n\nHot 8 will show the film A Deal with the Devil?, by Avida Livny, a look at the little-known and very controversial agreement between Jewish leaders, the British, and the Nazi governments to allow 60,000 German Jews to emigrate to Palestine in 1933. Hot 8 will also show Paula Apsell and Kirk Wolfinger's Resistance: They Fought Back, which tells previously unknown stories of resistance during the Holocaust. Hot 3 will feature a broadcast of the program Zikaron BaSalon, where Holocaust survivors share their stories with small groups in private homes.\n\nAn extensive program of movies\n\nThe Tel Aviv Cinematheque will feature an extensive program of movies starting the week before Holocaust Remembrance Day. Among these will be Orna Ben Dor's Because of That War, about the children of Holocaust survivors, including musician Yehuda Poliker, with the director attending to discuss the film. Isaac Brown's English-language Traces, Voices of the Second Generation also looks at how the Holocaust affects the second generation. Yoav Paz and Doron Paz's recent feature-film, Plan A, also in English, tells a fact-based story about Nakam, a group of survivors who planned to take revenge on Germany by poisoning the water system there.\n\nMost of the programs at the Jerusalem Cinematheque are free of charge, and they include a screening of the movie One Life, which is still playing in other theaters around Israel, which tells the true story of a British man, Sir Nicholas Winton, played by Anthony Hopkins, who saved many Jewish children from Europe.\n\nOne of the Kindertransport children, George Shefi, will speak in Hebrew at the screening. It will also present AMCHA's Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony, with the participation of Holocaust survivors and their families, October 7 survivors, and evacuees from the North and the South. Singer Shuli Rand will perform and it will be hosted by Ofer Hadad.\n\nFor those who haven't seen it or would like to watch it again, Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, the most famous Holocaust drama of all time, is available on Netflix and Apple TV+.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kan_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kan 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the Jews in Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Mirren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helen Mirren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie's_Choice_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophie's Choice (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_J._Pakula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan J.

REUTERS/Nir Elias\n\nBy Dan Williams\n\nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Holocaust commemorations this year have a searing significance for six elderly survivors now deeply scarred by the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 that sparked the ongoing Gaza war.\n\nThe killing and kidnapping spree by Palestinian infiltrators on a Jewish holiday morning shook the sense of security of Israelis - not least, those who had witnessed the state emerge as a safe haven after the Nazi genocide.\n\nFor Bellha Haim, 86, the upheaval is especially profound.\n\nHer grandson Yotam - like her, a resident of a village near the Gaza border - was taken hostage by Hamas and managed to escape, only to be accidentally shot dead by Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe trauma drove Haim to return to her native Poland, which she had fled with her family as a child during World War Two, and where she will on Monday take part of the \"March of the Living\" at the site of the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nThe annual ceremony is timed to coincide with Israel's Holocaust memorial day.\n\n\"I never went back, and I wasn't convinced to go back,\" she said during a meeting with other survivors ahead of the trip.\n\n\"But this time, when they told me that they were connecting the Holocaust and what I call the 'Holocaust of October 7' - because then in the Holocaust we (Jews) were not a united people, we didn't have a country, and suddenly this pride of mine that has been broken, my pride in my people and my country that was shattered in front of my eyes - I said, 'This time I will break my oath and I will go out.'\"\n\nAs a teenager, Yotam had taken part in the annual Auschwitz vigil and Haim said she saw the event as a chance for communion with him and other victims of the Hamas attack.\n\n\"I will go out in the name of Yotam, who marched there when he was in high school, and I will go out there to shout out the cry of the slain, of the babies, of all my good friends that I will never meet again,\" she said.\n\nARABIC YELLING AND GUNFIRE\n\nAmong those joining her will be 90-year-old Daniel Louz, whose hometown Kibbutz Beeri lost a tenth of its residents to the Palestinian attackers.\n\nIn some ways, he said, that ordeal was worse for him than the European war, when he escaped Nazi round-ups in his native France although half his family perished in Poland.\n\nAfter he awoke to the sound of Arabic yelling and gunfire, \"I was constantly busy with surviving and figuring out what to do,\" Louz said. \"In France, as a child, I suffered all kinds of post-traumas that I've learned to cope with. But in Beeri, it was the first time that I felt the fear of death.\"\n\nA neighbouring house was riddled with bullets. Louz's was untouched. He says he imagined the souls of the six million Holocaust victims steering Hamas away from him. \"They probably wanted me to be here to tell this story,\" he said, weeping.\n\nOther Holocaust survivors participating in the March of the Living include Smil Bercu Sacagiu, 87, whose home was hit by a rocket from Gaza, and Jacqueline Gliksman, 81, whose home was torched by a Palestinian infiltrator.\n\n\"What was left, and luckily the terrorist didn't see it, is my grandchildren,\" she said, referring to gold figurines on a necklace she was wearing. \"That's the only thing I have left.\"\n\nBefore he was seized, Haim's grandson left a text message: \"They're burning down my house. I smell gas. I'm scared.\"\n\nShe said that reminded her of a Holocaust-era song in Yiddish, invoking centuries of pogroms, with the refrain \"fire, Jews, fire\". A veteran campaigner for peace with the Palestinians, Haim said she would no longer pursue that activism.\n\n\"I'm not able to,\" she said. \"Now what interests me is only my people.\"\n\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by Barbara Lewis)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The event recreates the three-kilometre march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where about one million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still antisemitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most sombre days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren, when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4\u00bd years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during the Second World War serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left the baby behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Mefalsim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange program. After her studies, she returned to Mefalsim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Mefalsim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swaths of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed about 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others, according to Israeli tallies. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven about 80 per cent of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes.\n\nThe high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any antisemitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into antisemitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Mefalsim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Mefalsim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometres of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Mefalsim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Mefalsim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv for the past seven months, uncertain of next steps -- although Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the Oct. 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nTzamir is one of about 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate from their homes due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates that 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Mefalsim, just 1.6 kilometres from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate over the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, Tzamir said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" she said as her husband, Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"", "source": {"uri":

As one of the darkest chapters in human history, the unimaginable inhumanity, loss, and grief faced during the Holocaust and from its memories, will never go away.\n\nThis year, Yom HaShoah comes as Jewish communities are still reeling from Hamas' brutal October 7 terrorist attacks against Israel - the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust - and the subsequent disturbing rise in antisemitism in Canada and around the world. Canada unequivocally condemns Hamas' attacks, anyone who glorifies their indefensible actions, and the unacceptable acts of antisemitic violence that have targeted Canada's Jewish community.\n\nOn this day, we must remember, but we must also learn, educate others, and renew our eternal obligation to stop this from ever happening again.\n\nThe Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, today highlighted a $90.5 million package of measures from Budget 2024 to combat antisemitism, preserve Holocaust remembrance, educate against Holocaust denial and distortion, and protect gathering spaces for Jewish people.\n\nThis includes:\n\nCreating a new, permanent national Holocaust remembrance program. Budget 2024 includes an investment of $5 million that will support initiatives to preserve the memory of the Holocaust for future generations, and help more Canadians learn about the atrocities committed and the prevalence of antisemitism that led to them.\n\nSupporting the construction of the new Montr\u00e9al Holocaust Museum. The Government of Canada will invest $5 million to help build this museum, which aims to educate a new generation of visitors, including students, about the horrors and injustice of the Holocaust. This builds on a previous investment of $20 million to support this project and is part of a suite of generational investments to support the redevelopment and renewal of Canada's major Holocaust education centres. This includes investments of $2.5 million for the Toronto Holocaust Museum and $25 million to support the construction of a new Jewish Community Centre of Greater Vancouver, which will include an expanded home for the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre.\n\nStrengthening our support to Canada's Special Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combatting Antisemitism. Budget 2024 will provide $7.3 million to support Special Envoy Deborah Lyons' work to help build a more inclusive society and ensure that current and future generations of Jewish people can be and feel safe at home and abroad. This builds on previous funding in Budget 2022 of $5.6 million over five years, starting in 2022-23.\n\nKeeping communities safe against hate-motivated crime. Budget 2024 announces $41.2 million to improve the collection and availability of hate crime data in Canada, support police colleges to increase training on handling hate crimes, develop and deliver specialized training to Crown prosecutors, and raise awareness in the judiciary about the unique dynamics of hate crime. By ensuring we have the right data and that police, prosecutors, and judges are trained to prevent and enforce hate crimes, we can improve our ability to comprehensively combat this hate.\n\nProtecting synagogues and cultural spaces. As part of Canada's Action Plan on Combatting Hate, Budget 2024 will provide $32 million through the Security Infrastructure Program to increase security at gathering spaces, such as synagogues, day schools, and community centres. This will protect communities at risk of hate-motivated crime, including Jewish communities. We will also be cutting red tape and evolving the Security Infrastructure Program to make it easier and more efficient for organizations to access security support when they need it.\n\nLaunching a review to renew and enhance Canada's National Holocaust Monument. Using existing resources, the federal government will work with Holocaust scholars, educational experts, and the local community to increase the Monument's visibility and engagement in Ottawa, Ontario, and with Canadians across the country.\n\nTo Jewish Canadians - we stand with you. Our solidarity is steadfast. And our commitment to your safety is ironclad. Whether it's at a synagogue or a Jewish business or school; whether it's wearing the Star of David or a Kippah - Jewish Canadians deserve to feel safe, supported, and welcomed. They deserve to live openly and proudly Jewish lives, without intimidation or fear.\n\nWe will do whatever it takes to raise awareness of the Holocaust, fight antisemitism, and combat hate in all its forms - and those are just some of the things that we're doing to build a more fair and inclusive country for everyone in Budget 2024. As we mark Yom HaShoah, Canada reaffirms its commitment to stand with Jewish communities so this dark chapter in history is never repeated.\n\n\"We stand with Jewish Canadians - today on Yom HaShoah, and everyday. We must stand together, remind ourselves of the consequences of hate, educate others, and renew our efforts to root out antisemitism. Jewish Canadians deserve to live openly and proudly Jewish lives, without intimidation or fear.\"\n\n\"Simply saying 'never again' is not enough. In this year's budget, we are making investments and taking concrete action to confront antisemitism, hatred, and intolerance in all its forms - while reaffirming our commitment to stand with Jewish Canadians.\"\n\n\"Antisemitism has no place in Canada. The investments in Budget 2024 will help educate current and future generations of Canadians, ensuring we never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and always stand up against antisemitism, and all forms of hatred.\"\n\n\"It is painful - but essential - that we never forget the stories, families, and legacy of those lost in the Holocaust.

Every Israeli stands at attention in silent memory of the six million murdered by the Nazis in their attempt at a \"Final Solution.\" This morning, two sirens were sounded in my town, Katzrin; one for the victims of the Holocaust and the other to warn residents of rockets launched by Hezbollah, a modern manifestation of an ancient evil.\n\nJewish holidays tend to come in waves. This time of year is punctuated by three national holidays with an implicit internal connection: Yom Hashoah (Holocaust Memorial Day), Yom Hazikaron (Memorial Day), and Yom Haatzmaut (Independence Day). I waited in trepidation as the time approached. October 7 was still foremost in the consciousness of every Israeli, especially as the war ground on. October 7 was a horrific terrorist attack, but unlike other tragedies that faded as time went on, the following months revealed a deeper, more horrifying truth. Israel was attacked on multiple fronts: north, east, south, and even from distant Iran. The deep-seated Jew'hated, which had been hidden below the surface on American campuses, burst to the surface. For the first time since World War II, Jews were demonized and hated with no sanctuary.\n\nHolocaust comparisons are usually shunned by Jews. In a particularly grotesque form of anti-factual antisemitism, Jew-haters demonize Israel by comparing its treatment of Palestinians to the Nazi treatment of Jews. But no matter how bad any anti-Jewish atrocity was, Jews never compared it to the Holocaust. With the largest population of Holocaust survivors, Israel knew that any tragedy paled in comparison to the deaths of six million.\n\nThat was true until October 7. I entered Yom Hashoah with the recent memory of living through the most horrific day in Jewish history since the Holocaust. October 7 changed the Jewish people. We were faced with the realization that we had failed in our pledge of 'Never Again.' The IDF, the wall that stood between us and another Holocaust, had faltered, stumbled for a brief moment that allowed the Palestinians to realize their dream of continuing the Nazi mission.\n\nWhile Israel recovered, similarities to the Holocaust began to emerge. Jew hatred was reborn as the driving force behind several nations and international organizations. While this was unsurprising, its intensity flaming up was stunning. The UN and UNRWA no longer felt it necessary to hide their active support of terrorist organizations with Jewish blood on their hands.\n\nBut Israel was in for another unpleasant surprise. When studying the Holocaust, Jews are always faced with the question of why the Jews of Europe stayed. They surely must have seen the writing on the wall after the Nuremberg Laws and Kristallnacht. American Jews are facing the same screaming crowds. And despite being able to leave (for the time being), there is no call for a Jewish exodus from the US. Surely, the rabbis, in their wisdom, would lead their flocks out of the jaws of danger. But the American rabbis are silent. The only Jewish voices raised in warning, screaming against the raging monster that threatens American Jews, are Jewish students. However, these students, raised by their parents and communities to be leaders in the liberal world, were never given the strength of the Torah to guide them in today's challenging reality.\n\nWe are watching the same story play out in real-time. Just as in pre-war Nazi Germany, Jews are being excluded from universities. While the US has not passed anti-Jewish laws, openly antisemitic lawmakers are quickly taking over the US Congress with the same youthful zeal as the Brown Shirts. And social media has taken on the face of a Nazi rally in the Kongresshalle, with millions of faceless Hitlers urging each other on.\n\nTo be honest, there are far too many similarities between what is happening today and the events and atmosphere that led to the Holocaust. I cannot list them all. But there are three differences.\n\nThe first difference is that we now have Israel as a refuge from foreign governments that have abandoned their morality and their Jewish citizens. There will never be another SS Exodus, traveling from port to port in search of a safe haven for its Jewish passengers. El Al stands ready, and just as it snatched the Jews from the jaws of danger in Ethiopia, flying them home on the Wings of Eagles as long-lost brothers, El Al can be trusted to bring any endangered Jews to safety.\n\nThe second difference is the IDF. When Israel was attacked, this generation answered. After more than six months of war, morale remains very high. While the Israeli government wavers, weighing political considerations, every Israeli citizen knows that not a single soldier will agree to come home until all the hostages are returned and every last Hamas and Hezbollah is dead.\n\nBut the third difference is truly stunning. Righteous Gentiles did exist in the Holocaust. Their deeds and devotion were awe-inspiring. They showed the greatness of the human spirit. While there are far too many to list in this article, they were the exception and very much not the rule. Yes, faith-based Jew-hatred and antisemitism is common among Christians. But there is a more-than-significant Christian movement that loves the Nation of Israel because of their Christian faith and not despite it.\n\nThere is one more new aspect that has me terrified. Some purveyors of Jew-hatred have learned to be polite, to speak in socially acceptable terms, and to be politically correct. While it is no longer acceptable to advocate for Judenrein or a \"Final Solution,\" the \"moral necessity\" of ethnically cleansing Jews is being sold as a \"two-state solution.\" While it is no longer polite to advocate for a Holocaust, Obama pushed through the Iran deal, greenlighting and even funding an Iranian nuclear weapons program while the Iranians were screaming 'Death to Israel' and writing this phrase on their ICBMs.\n\nAnd when President Biden was informed by the Iranian government of their intention to fire a massive wave of these weapons at the Jewish state, he told them that he would not intervene or prevent them.\n\nSo, as the second siren of the day begins to fade, I am reminded that the old evil has simply taken on a new face. As my wife explained, the first siren was because they were trying to kill us. The second siren was because they had already killed so many of us, not so long ago.", "source": {"uri": "israel365news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel365 News | Latest News.

Expressions of support of Hamas, calls for intifada, and chanting slogans calling for the removal of Israel, has left the Jewish community feeling vulnerable. A planned counter-march by antisemitism campaigner Gideon Falter had to be cancelled on Saturday over security fears. The march was intended to be a response after Falter was told by a police officer the previous week that he was concerned for his safety for being 'openly Jewish'.\n\nNow it seems that it is 'openly Jewish' Holocaust memorials that are the problem. Images emerged online at the weekend of the Holocaust Memorial in London's Hyde Park covered up by plastic tarpaulin. According to Royal Parks, the authority that oversees central London's parklands, the action was not ordered by the Met Police. Presumably, Royal Parks covered the monument to protect it from the pro-Palestinian mobs. On the surface this might be a sensible precaution, but in reality, the memorial should not have to be covered in the first place.\n\nThe memorial is inscribed in both English and Hebrew, and reads: \"For these I weep. Streams of tears flow from my eyes because of the destruction of my people,\" a quotation from the Book of Lamentations.\n\nThe memorial would only have been in danger from antisemites - that doesn't cast a good reflection on some of those demonstrating. The Holocaust Memorial honouring more than 6 million murdered should have been left uncovered so that every anti-Israel protester could walk by and have their conscience challenged. As well as honouring Holocaust victims, it is intended to serve as a reminder of the severe consequence of antisemitism if not addressed at the root.\n\nInstead, the Holocaust memorial in Hyde Park was covered up. The 6 million victims disappeared. The reminder of antisemitism hidden. That is what those who hate the Jewish people want. Maybe because it would be more comfortable to just pass on by; more convenient than to look the other way. It would be more comfortable than being provoked to think about a tragedy so 'openly Jewish'.\n\nAnd herein lies the problem of Britain since 7th October 2023. Too many people have felt comfortable turning away from the atrocities of Hamas's murder of Jews. It has been more convenient to call for a ceasefire without demanding the release of Jewish hostages. And it has been easier to stand by and watch antisemites pass by than it is to allow Jews to be 'openly Jewish'.\n\nYad Vashem, which described the move as \"a stain on our society,\" said that concealing these historical reminders only addresses the symptoms while \"ignoring the root cause of the issue.\" They are right.\n\nAntisemitism past or present should never ever be covered up.\n\n_______\n\nImage: Holocaust memorial in Hyde Park: \u00a9 Franco Pfaller (WMR-122)\n\nCovered Holocaust memorial in Hyde Park: Hollie Adam (Reuters)", "source": {"uri": "cufi.org.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Christians United for Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyde Park, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Lamentations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Book of Lamentations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yad Vashem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Franco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://www.cufi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/440768753_466356615827369_3315514625073717095_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 79, "textEnd": 90, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

But in Beeri, it was the first time that I felt the fear of death.\"\n\nA neighbouring house was riddled with bullets. Louz's was untouched. He says he imagined the souls of the six million Holocaust victims steering Hamas away from him. \"They probably wanted me to be here to tell this story,\" he said, weeping.\n\nOther Holocaust survivors participating in the March of the Living include Smil Bercu Sacagiu, 87, whose home was hit by a rocket from Gaza, and Jacqueline Gliksman, 81, whose home was torched by a Palestinian infiltrator.\n\n\"What was left, and luckily the terrorist didn't see it, is my grandchildren,\" she said, referring to gold figurines on a necklace she was wearing. \"That's the only thing I have left.\"\n\nBefore he was seized, Haim's grandson left a text message: \"They're burning down my house. I smell gas. I'm scared.\"\n\nShe said that reminded her of a Holocaust-era song in Yiddish, invoking centuries of pogroms, with the refrain \"fire, Jews, fire\". A veteran campaigner for peace with the Palestinians, Haim said she would no longer pursue that activism.\n\n\"I'm not able to,\" she said. \"Now what interests me is only my people.\"\n\n(Writing by Dan Williams; editing by Barbara Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "March of the Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish holidays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eucharist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yiddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pogrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/64db6bf/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fed%2F9bcbd8983e567b4dd4c6a9079b48f1%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK44023%3A12024-05-05T094157Z_1_LYNXMPEK44023_RTROPTP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-HOLOCAUST-SURVIVORS.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 169, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Police sirens wailed as protestors displayed banners at groups wearing Israeli flags along the sidelines of the event, which brings together thousands annually to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day in silence.\n\nEyewitnesses claimed protestors were 'chanting' at participants on the march, with Israelis responding with lines from 'Am Israel chai', a Jewish solidarity anthem. Survivors of Hamas ' October 7 incursion into southern Israel were also in attendance as participants marched the two-mile (three kilometers) walk from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately one million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\n\nJust last week, distressing footage invoked fury as a man filmed himself walking through the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Auschwitz and saying: 'You belong here. This is your place of origin. You left these camps and ghettos. Long live Palestine .' Tensions continue to soar as the war in the Levant approaches seven months. As ceasefire talks continue in Cairo, Israel is preparing to invade the Gazan city of Rafah, today ordering 100,000 people to evacuate and sparking outrage from those sympathetic to the Palestinian cause worldwide.\n\nAcknowledging the protests, the International March of the Living said in a statement: 'We marched today to give a voice to the six million victims of the Nazis industrial genocide of the Jewish people. 'We marched with survivors of the Nazi atrocities as well as survivors of Hamas' crimes and families of those still held in captivity. 'The half a dozen protestors who perversely saw this as an opportunity to voice hatred against Israel and the Jewish people serve as a timely reminder of the importance of Holocaust education and remembrance and of teaching the dangers of hatred and extremism.'\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. Fifty-six survivors of the Shoah are expecting to take part in the march alongside an anticipated 10,000 others traveling from across the world to observe the date. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march. Poland, which until the Holocaust was the home of Europe's largest Jewish community, numbering some 3.3 million, now counts just a few thousand Jewish inhabitants in its population.\n\nThe country continues to grapple with anti-Semitism despite the memory of the Holocaust. A pre-war survey found more than a third of people in Poland have 'extensive' anti-Semitic beliefs. Last week, a man was detained in Poland 'in connection to' the hurling of Molotov cocktails at the only Synagogue to have survived the Holocaust, an attack that drew ire from Polish officials and Jewish leaders. Photos showed the aftermath of the attack on the No\u017cyk Synagogue.\n\n'If it (the bottle) had gone 15 centimeters to the left it would have reached the window and possibly inside the synagogue. There's a library there,' Poland 's chief rabbi Michael Schudrich told reporters at the time. Reports continue to cite the unnerving trend of rising anti-Semitism across Europe as tensions soar over the conflict in Gaza.\n\nHamas, the de facto governing authority in the Palestinian enclave, took more than 250 people hostage and killed some 1,170, mostly civilians, in a surprise attack on Israel on October 7 last year. One hundred and thirty two hostages remained in Hamas captivity within the beleaguered Gaza Strip as of May 3, with 112 so far returned alive.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any anti-Semitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. The subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza, listing objectives to return the hostages and destroy Hamas, has triggered international protests, with rights groups and aid charities warning the 2.3 million people in Gaza face famine if operations continue.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

We can't help but fear in the deepest crevices of our soul.\"\n\nPro-Palestine protesters and police clashed last Monday evening after officers tried to clear a makeshift encampment on the lawn outside the James Branch Cabell Library on Virginia Commonwealth University's Monroe Park campus. The protesters were pitching tents in what they called a \"liberation zone\" and demanding an immediate end to Israel's offensive in Gaza; 13 people were arrested.\n\nOn Sunday, Beth Ahabah performed the chanting of the El Maleh Rachamim and the Mourner's Kaddish during the ceremony before the keynote address by Ambassador Stuart E.

The contest theme was \"Never Again.\"\n\nSix Holocaust memorial candles were lit during the ceremony by survivor families from the Richmond region. The six candles signify the 6 million Jewish people who perished in the Holocaust. One of the candles is shorter than the others to represent the 1.5 million children who were killed.\n\nRoger Loria, 84, lit the second candle.\n\n\"They declared me a deserter at 3 years old because I escaped deportation,\" Loria said.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, the entire paternal side of Loria's family died. Loria and his mother evaded capture while moving from town to town across central Europe before finding a haven in a Swiss refugee camp in 1944.\n\n\"It was hate,\" he said. \"It's important that people know that. It is extremely important that people know the history and the truth so they do not repeat it because of ignorance.\"\n\nThe museum's Yom HaShoah ceremony offered a peaceful space for reflection on the past, but attendees were not dismissive about their fears for today. Both Samuel Asher and Eizenstat spoke on the uptick in security presence among the Jewish community.\n\n\"When I came here, every survivor that survived the war, their biggest desire was to come to America, but it's changing now. For me to see that really hurts me a lot,\" said Halina Zimm, a Holocaust survivor. \"I never believed this would happen in this country.\"\n\nZimm, 95, came to the U.S. when she was 21. She is grateful for the chance to tell her and her family's story.\n\n\"I was the lucky one. My mother, my father, tremendous family; they all died. I speak for them because they cannot speak for themselves,\" Zimm said. \"So I guess God wants me to be here, so I can tell the story.\"\n\nClose\n\nCantor Sara Beck-Berman chants the El Maleh Rachamim during the Yom Hashoah Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony at the Virginia Holocaust Museum in Richmond, Va.

The event recreates the two-mile (three-kilometre) march from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately one million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany.\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians. This year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\n\"I don't know if the world will listen, but even for myself, it's important,\" said Tzamir, who had turned down past invitations to visit Auschwitz. \"To remember that there's still anti-Semitism around, and there are still people who will kill just for religious reasons.\"\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day, marked on the anniversary of the outbreak of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, has traditionally been a time for Israelis to gather and listen to testimony from survivors.\n\nIt is one of the most sombre days of the year -- highlighted by a two-minute siren, when traffic halts and people stand at attention in memory of the victims. Memorial ceremonies are held throughout the day, and names of victims are recited. While Israel's national Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, tries to steer clear of politics, its ceremony this year includes an empty yellow chair in solidarity with the Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIn 1948, when Tzamir was 4 1/2 years old, the people she knew as her parents dressed her in a light blue dress, with black shoes and white socks, and took her to a plaza in Berlin. She remembers clutching her doll, Yula, when they revealed that they were not her parents and that the woman standing before them was her biological mother.\n\nTzamir's mother had hidden her Jewish identity during World War II by serving in the German army. She gave birth to Judith in 1943 in a hospital run by nuns, and left Judith behind to save her life. Tzamir, called Donata at the time, was placed in a foster family. She had no idea she was Jewish until she met her mother.\n\nSixteen years later, while she was in college, Tzamir went to Meflasim, a kibbutz in southern Israel on the border with Gaza, through a student-exchange programme. After her studies, she returned to Meflasim, fell in love with a new immigrant from Argentina who was also living on the kibbutz, and stayed, raising four children.\n\nOn October 7, Tzamir was faced with the possibility of losing her home once again. Hamas militants poured over the border from Gaza and attacked towns, army bases and a music festival in southern Israel. Meflasim was luckier than many other kibbutzim in the area, where militants burned homes and left wide swathes of destruction.\n\nThe militants killed around 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and kidnapped 250 others. The attack sparked the Israeli invasion in Gaza, where the death toll has soared to more than 34,500 people, according to local health officials, and driven around 80 per cent of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. The high death toll and humanitarian crisis have prompted genocide accusations against Israel in the International Court of Justice -- a charge that Israel angrily rejects.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any anti-Semitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive. For most Jewish Israelis, global protests calling for boycotts of Israel and questioning the country's right to exist often veer into anti-Semitism.\n\nOn the day of the attack, Meflasim's emergency preparedness squad was able to hold most of the Hamas militants outside the kibbutz perimeter. Many residents stayed in safe rooms for nearly 24 hours, until the Israeli army was able to evacuate them the next day.\n\nAlthough there were no fatalities at Meflasim, its roughly 800 residents were told to leave, along with more than 120,000 Israelis who lived within a few kilometres of the borders with Gaza and Lebanon. Meflasim, Tzamir's steady anchor after a childhood filled with upheaval and uncertainty, was no longer a safe haven.\n\nMany Meflasim residents have been living in a hotel north of Tel Aviv the past seven months, uncertain of next steps, though Tzamir and some others hope to return to the kibbutz in June.\n\nTzamir said the October 7 attack brought up all kinds of memories from her childhood trauma. She could function during the day, but when she went to sleep her dreams were filled with blood and death and fires, visions that reminded her of the bombings she witnessed as a child in Germany.\n\nTzamir is one of approximately 2,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel who were forced to evacuate due to the war in Gaza, according to Israel's Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. The ministry estimates 132,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel.\n\nTzamir served as a director of her kibbutz for 13 years, so she knows every resident. She said some families may never return to Meflasim, just a mile (1.4 kilometres) from the Gaza border. Explosions from Gaza reverberate on the buildings, and the sense of security is difficult to reclaim.\n\nBut it was never a question for her, she said.\n\n\"I'm 80 years old, I don't want to lose my home again,\" Tzamir said, as her husband, Ran, busied himself tending to a garden bursting with succulents and flowers, just before their flight to Poland. \"We are coming back.\"", "source": {"uri":

This is your place of origin. You left these camps and ghettos. Long live Palestine.'\n\nTensions continue to soar as the war in the Levant approaches seven months. As ceasefire talks continue in Cairo, Israel is preparing to invade the Gazan city of Rafah, today ordering 100,000 people to evacuate and sparking outrage from those sympathetic to the Palestinian cause worldwide.\n\nPeople demonstrate with Palestinian flags on the sidelines of the March of the Living route\n\nThe event near the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp annually marks Holocaust Remembrance Day\n\nBellha Haim, grandmother of the murdered hostage Yotam Haim, participates in the March of the Living at Auschwitz on May 6, 2024\n\nA man holds Israel's flag at the former Nazi German death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau during the annual Holocaust remembrance event, in Oswiecim, Poland, on May 6, 2024\n\nAcknowledging the protests, the International March of the Living said in a statement: 'We marched today to give a voice to the six million victims of the Nazi's industrial genocide of the Jewish people.\n\n'We marched with survivors of the Nazi atrocities as well as survivors of Hamas' crimes and families of those still held in captivity.\n\n'The half a dozen protestors who perversely saw this as an opportunity to voice hatred against Israel and the Jewish people serve as a timely reminder of the importance of Holocaust education and remembrance and of teaching the dangers of hatred and extremism.'\n\nThe event, now in its 36th year, usually draws thousands of participants, including Holocaust survivors and Jewish students, leaders and politicians.\n\nFifty-six survivors of the Shoah are expecting to take part in the march alongside an anticipated 10,000 others travelling from across the world to observe the date.\n\nThis year, Israeli hostages released from captivity in Gaza and families whose relatives are still being held captive will also join the march.\n\nPoland, which until the Holocaust was the home of Europe's largest Jewish community, numbering some 3.3 million, now counts just a few thousand Jewish inhabitants in its population.\n\nThe country continues to grapple with anti-Semitism despite the memory of the Holocaust.\n\nA pre-war survey found more than a third of people in Poland have 'extensive' anti-Semitic beliefs.\n\nLast week, a man was detained in Poland 'in connection to' the hurling of Molotov cocktails at the only Synagogue to have survived the Holocaust, an attack that drew ire from Polish officials and Jewish leaders.\n\nPhotos showed the aftermath of the attack on the No\u017cyk Synagogue.\n\n'If it (the bottle) had gone 15 centimetres to the left it would have reached the window and possibly inside the synagogue. There's a library there,' Poland's chief rabbi Michael Schudrich told reporters at the time.\n\nReports continue to cite the unnerving trend of rising anti-Semitism across Europe as tensions soar over the conflict in Gaza.\n\nHamas, the de facto governing authority in the Palestinian enclave, took more than 250 people hostage and killed some 1,170, mostly civilians, in a surprise attack on Israel on October 7 last year.\n\nOne hundred and thirty two hostages remained in Hamas captivity within the beleaguered Gaza Strip as of May 3, with 112 so far returned alive.\n\nHamas has said its attack was aimed against Israeli occupation and its blockade of Gaza, and pro-Palestinian activists deny any anti-Semitic motives in their opposition to Israel's military offensive.\n\nThe subsequent Israeli invasion of Gaza, listing objectives to return the hostages and destroy Hamas, has triggered international protests, with rights groups and aid charities warning the 2.3 million people in Gaza face famine if operations continue.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(WCSC) - The Charleston Jewish Federation invited the community to observe Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, on Sunday.\n\nThe Director of Educational Initiatives for the Charleston Jewish Federation, Natanya Miller, said this event brings in around 300 Jewish and non-Jewish community members to remember the 6 million Jewish people who were murdered in the Shoah, which means Holocaust.\n\nThe program honors those who did and did not survive the Holocaust. Miller says many family and community members come out who had a connection to someone who lost their life in the Holocaust.\n\n\"The overall goal of Yom HaShoah for us is to bring the community together. To realize that together we can overcome hate because that is what the Holocaust was. It was hate. It was a genocide born of hatred,\" Miller said.\n\nThe theme of this year's Yom HaShoah was \"Beyond Survival - A Legacy of Resistance\", and Miller said that the theme is a reflection of what they do in their organization.\n\n\"Now more than ever, this idea of resistance is so important. What does it mean to resist, what does it mean to have a legacy, what is a legacy of resistance mean,\" Miller said. \"It's really easy to say that the people who survived, survived out of luck or survived out of this, but there is so much more than that.\"\n\nMiller said resistance can mean anything, such as standing up for one another, actively fighting against something or just being a friend to somebody.\n\nDuring the program, they read off the names of those who didn't survive the Holocaust but have a connection to Charleston.\n\nShe added that most of their committee is made up of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who were in the Holocaust.\n\nAt the event, they are also visiting and commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Charleston Holocaust Memorial. Miller said the memorial is a place of reflection and introspection when you're taking in the different aspects of the memorial such as the Jewish prayer shawl, the walls, and the camps that are written on the sides.\n\nYom HaShoah also had a keynote speaker, Chad Gibbs, who is also the Director of Holocaust studies at the College of Charleston. He talked about the different ways people should think about when they hear the word resistance. He said that this event is important to the community as Charleston's links to the Holocaust are very deep.\n\n\"Many Charleston Jews have families that survived the Holocaust or managed to get out just before, and we are in a way, kind of honoring those people, both those who were able to come to the U.S. afterwards and those who never got out,\" Gibbs said.\n\nMiller encouraged anyone who is interested in getting involved or learning more about their educational opportunities to visit their website or give her a call at 843-614-6486.", "source": {"uri": "live5news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.live5news.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_Charleston", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College of Charleston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_prayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish prayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://gray-wcsc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OVKEM7CLTRAFBNWK32JPP3PGBU.png?auth=7f9c34e055641f30c2f6d4cba37f477120c3bf367b548cf64de6c5a1b8eaca1b&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Tobin is editor-in-chief of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate). Follow him @jonathans_tobin.\n\nFor decades, American Jewry has marked Yom Hashoah -- Holocaust Remembrance Day -- with the same rituals and rhetoric. They heard from survivors, whose numbers continue to dwindle and who bore witness about their horrific experiences. They also heard from scholars, who were part of what had become a growth industry centering on Holocaust studies, which to many Jews and non-Jews became the sum total of their knowledge of the history of the Jewish people. And they also heard from politicians and community leaders, who mouthed empty rhetoric about \"never again\" letting such an awful thing happen.\n\nIt was a necessary exercise because, not without reason, Jews feared that without the ceremonies, memorials and museums that proliferated in the last few decades, the memory of the destruction of European Jewry at the hands of the German Nazis and their collaborators would be lost or erased. Preserving that memory will require continued work from Jews today and our successors.\n\nBut after Oct. 7, 2023 -- and all that has happened since then -- we cannot continue conducting these same rituals in the same manner as before.\n\nInstead, we must begin to integrate our necessary commemorations of the Holocaust into the broader context of Jewish history and the struggle for Jewish survival throughout the ages and into the present-day war against Israel.\n\nJust as important, we must reassess our approach to Holocaust education in light of the horrifying reactions to the largest mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust and the surge in antisemitism that has occurred throughout the world and, most particularly, on North American college campuses.\n\nDefenseless no more\n\nIn the last eight decades since the Holocaust and then the birth of modern-day Israel in 1948, the world has remained a generally dangerous place for Jews. But the generations who grew up since these epochal events, particularly in the United States, thought of antisemitism and attempts at Jewish genocide as something that was relegated to the distant past. But after the horror of that Black Shabbat and Simchat Torah -- when residents of 22 Israeli communities and hundreds of attendees at a music festival were attacked by Hamas and their Palestinian allies in an orgy of murder, rape, torture, kidnapping and wanton destruction -- that complacency is no longer viable.\n\nThough much lip service has been paid to memorializing the Holocaust and promises made about not forgetting it, after Oct. 7, the usual routine of drawing lessons from the events of the past won't wash anymore. Despite Jews being subjected to unspeakable atrocities by vicious enemies who are, once again, bent on their extermination, the international community has turned on them.\n\nWhile much of the world looks on with indifference and disinterest -- or actually cheers on the murderers -- the events of the Holocaust are no longer so remote from our contemporary experience. The difference, of course, is that the Jewish people are no longer defenseless. In the era from 1939 to 1945, the Jews had little or no ability to either defend themselves or find safe haven from a genocidal foe where they would be welcomed. Now the full force of international opinion and intellectual fashion is arrayed against the State of Israel, whose existence is the one true memorial to the 6 million men, women and children slain by the Nazis. It alone ensures that two millennia of Jews being persecuted and/or slaughtered with impunity have come to an end.\n\nHaving suffered the fate of powerless victims at the hands of the Nazis, in the wake of Oct. 7, the Jews now are now demonized by those who think that they have no right to defend themselves against Hamas and other terror groups that wish to destroy Israel and slaughter its Jewish population. Despite being the party that was attacked and, according to objective military observers, using more care in avoiding civilian casualties in the course of conducting urban combat than any other contemporary army, Israel's subsequent military campaign to eliminate Hamas is routinely smeared as a \"genocide.\"\n\nIndeed, the entire apparatus of international human-rights advocacy and aid that was created in the wake of the Holocaust is now not only weaponized against the Jewish victims of Islamist attacks.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nAs much as the conflict between Israel and its foes has always been a complex problem, the post-Oct. 7 surge in antisemitism has nothing to do with the actual events of the current war with Hamas. It needs to be repeated that Gaza wasn't occupied on Oct. 6 and that the failure to create a Palestinian Arab state (aside from the one that existed in Gaza in all but name since Israel's 2005 withdrawal) is the result of repeated refusals from both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to make peace or accept the legitimacy of a Jewish state, no matter where its borders might be drawn.\n\nOld/new woke antisemitic propaganda\n\nIf Israel is now routinely and falsely accused of being an \"apartheid state\" or committing \"genocide,\" it is due to the success of a leftist/Islamist propaganda campaign that has convinced a considerable portion of young Americans, as well as those elsewhere that it has no right to exist. Those who chant for its destruction or cheer on the prospect of more terrorism against Jews on college campuses have been indoctrinated in the toxic myths of critical race theory and intersectionality that analogize the war to destroy the one Jewish state on the planet to the struggle for civil rights in the United States.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, a Nazi movement steeped in racism convinced the citizens of the most educated nation on earth to see Jews as subhuman. Now, many of the most educated elements of American society have been seduced by a movement that dubs itself \"anti-racist\" but that is predicated on the notion that we are all locked in a perpetual race war between white oppressors and victims who are people of color. Like all variants of Marxism, this woke ideology targets Jews and classifies them as \"white\" oppressors, even though the conflict with the Palestinians has nothing to do with race and the majority of Israeli Jews are themselves people of color since they trace their origins to the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nJews suffering from a wave of antisemitism since Oct. 7 is the result of the success that \"progressives\" have had in making this new secular religion the orthodoxy that prevails throughout academia and many other sectors of American society. As historian Niall Ferguson noted in his seminal Free Press essay, \"The Treason of the Intellectuals,\" much like the way the demonization of Jews was enabled by the educated classes prior to the Holocaust, contemporary elites have embraced this old/new faith that also legitimizes Jew-hatred.\n\nThe woke lies have not gone unanswered, and the open advocacy for violence against Jews and the excesses of the student protests have shocked many Americans. But they are still repeated every day in much of the corporate liberal media and by leading political figures. Leading news outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post, and broadcasters like MSNBC and CNN, consider them ideas to be debated and which reasonable people should agree to disagree about, rather than antisemitic and racist falsehoods to be condemned.\n\nHow then should we remember the Shoah at a time when Jews are once again under siege?\n\nThe perils of universalizing the Holocaust\n\nWe must start by no longer trying to isolate the Holocaust from the rest of Jewish history or contemporary struggles. The Shoah was a unique historical event that should not be treated -- as it is by many Americans as simply a metaphor for something very bad -- as merely just a particularly egregious example of man's inhumanity to man. But it must also be seen as part of the narrative of Jewish history that stretches back to the destruction of the Jewish commonwealth by the Romans to today.\n\nSadly, many, if not most, of those involved in the spread of Holocaust education have sought to make its lessons palatable to non-Jews by universalizing its lessons. As a result, rather than being understood as an example of how antisemitism is hatred used for specific political purposes, it became merely seen as stemming from ordinary prejudice.\n\nThat was mistaken, in and of itself. But it also made it less likely that even those who had undergone some sort of rudimentary Holocaust education -- as is true of many if not most of today's college students -- would be unable to understand how current woke ideas grant a permission slip to antisemitism. Indeed, the language of Holocaust education is now used against Israel and the Jews with their enemies no longer using the vulgar dehumanizing terms employed by the Nazis but instead libelously accusing them of being genocidal racists.\n\nThis means that as we honor the memory of the Holocaust, we must now do so without ever forgetting that Jews are once again under siege today. And we must do so without losing sight of the critical fact that the only difference between then and now is that the Jewish people are not as vulnerable as they were in the world that existed without Jewish sovereignty and military power.\n\nWe keep being told that many of those who demonstrate in favor of an end to the current war that would leave Hamas alive and well -- and able to make good on its promises to repeat the horrors of Oct. 7 again and again -- are well-meaning and simply sympathetic to the suffering of Palestinians. But the objective of the movement these supposedly well-meaning people support is to strip the Jews of Israel -- and Jews everywhere, for that matter -- of the ability to defend themselves against Islamists for whom Oct. 7 is just a trailer for what they wish to do to every Jew on this planet.\n\nSimply put, if you are demonstrating for Hamas's survival, you are on the side of a group that wishes to repeat the Holocaust. No matter how well-intentioned you may claim to be, that makes you no different from those who viewed the Nazis, who had their own narrative of grievance, with equanimity.\n\nThe German people suffered terribly as a result of the war that they launched, yet today, those who claim to speak for humanitarian values believe that there can be no consequences for those who commit or condone (as is true for the overwhelming majority of Palestinians) the mass murder of Jews and that Jews who defend themselves against genocide are the Nazis. Would those who demonstrate against Jewish self-defense apply the same lessons to the Allies who, in order to liberate the Nazi death camps had to kill many people, including civilians?\n\nBy the same token, those who wish for universities and other institutions to engage in discriminatory commercial conduct that would divest from anything to do with Israel are not criticizing Israel's policies or leaders, but supporting a contemporary version of Nazi boycotts of Jews.\n\nIt is also just as clear that the leftist/Islamist attack on Israel is also aimed at the West and the United States. This debate over the war against Hamas is not one about whether Israel or its government and military are perfect but about a struggle for the future of the West, much as was true of the war against the German Nazis. The Jews are, as they were during the Holocaust, the canaries in the coal mine, warning humanity of the dangers of tolerating genocidal hate.\n\nAs we remember the Shoah, rather than stick to our usual routine of memorialization, it's time for decent people of all backgrounds and faiths to understand that the war on the Jews didn't end with the defeat of the Nazis. It continues to this day under new slogans, flags and worse, with many of those who claim to stand for enlightened thought allowing the enablers of Jew-hatred to pose as advocates for human rights and the oppressed. Those lies must not be allowed to stand.\n\nThere should be no Holocaust Memorial Day observance without it being made clear that there can be no proper honor given to the Six Million slain by the Nazis without linking that struggle to those against the antisemites of our time. We must not tolerate those who shed crocodile tears for Jews murdered in the past while tolerating or even supporting policies that enable antisemitism in the present, envisioning Israel's destruction and the continued slaughter of Jews. If we cannot understand that, then invocations to remember what happened or ensure that it is \"never again\" allowed in this world are nothing more than pointless and counterproductive virtue-signaling.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_s_tobin@jns.org", "name": "Jonathan S.

His latest documentary, Class of Her Own, is out on Amazon Prime, Apple TV, and other major platforms.\n\nThat's the rallying cry for many of those who feel shocked by skyrocketing antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses and K-12 schools. Learning about the Final Solution, the reasoning goes, steers young Americans against bigotry.\n\nAs the grandson of Auschwitz and Buchenwald survivors and an educator and documentary filmmaker who often tells Holocaust-related stories, I used to subscribe to this notion. But I've come to realize that despite being embedded in K-12 social studies, world history, and English literature curricula throughout the country, Holocaust education has failed to uproot hate and ignorance.\n\nSocial media, where teens spend about five hours a day on average, teem with \"Holocaust denial and distortion,\" as well as antisemitic and Islamophobic conspiracy theories. The latest, for instance, falsely blames the Jews for Congress' TikTok crackdown. No wonder K-12 schools' incidents of antisemitism and Islamophobia have skyrocketed, even before the Israel-Hamas War erupted and broke the hydrant of hatred wide open.\n\nRead More: Who Needs Holocaust Remembrance Day in 2024?\n\nIn recent weeks, a flood of Israel-Hamas War-related hostility has forced an increasing number of university administrations around the country -- such as Columbia, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Southern California -- to summon the police in an attempt to quell student protests. Columbia moved all classes online on the eve of Passover, suspended some protesters, and threatened to expel those who'd occupied a campus building. USC revamped its commencement plans. And although most protests have played out as legitimate political activism reminiscent of the 1960s student movements, some have reportedly crossed the line into antisemitic and Islamophobic vitriol and violence.\n\nOn campuses and schoolyards, Jews and Muslims have suffered physical and psychological harm -- from being jabbed in the face by a flagpole and requiring hospitalization to being called \"terrorists\" and needing mental-health counseling. The U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Office has been investigating several universities and school districts.\n\nHolocaust education, in its foundational intention, was supposed to nip much of this in the bud. Taught at elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the country since the 1970s, it's been positioned for wide impact. Twenty-six states require the instruction of the Holocaust. Most of the other states have funded commissions and councils to advance opportunities to educate students about the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews and millions of people with disabilities, homosexuals, and Romani people, among other groups.\n\nRead More: The Holocaust Began Not With Concentration Camps, But With Hateful Rhetoric. That Part of the Story Cannot Be Forgotten\n\nHistorically, conservatives and liberals alike have embraced Holocaust education. The 2020 Never Again Education Act passed by a 393-5 vote at the U.S. House of Representatives and unanimously at the U.S. Senate. Further setting Holocaust education up for success, nonprofits ranging from USC's Shoah Foundation in Los Angeles to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, have been supporting teachers for decades. Organization like Pittsburgh-based Classroom Without Borders have taken educators to the sites of Nazi death camps in Eastern Europe. On May 5, March of the Living is sending teachers and students, as well as the chancellors and presidents of SUNY (State University of New York), Towson, and other universities, to Poland. Stateside, 85 Holocaust museums and memorials have hosted countless school field trips.\n\nYet, Holocaust education has fallen far short even of its fundamental goal to raise awareness. Polls show young Americans lack \"basic knowledge\" about the Holocaust. About two-thirds know nothing or very little about Auschwitz and grossly underestimate the number of Jewish victims.\n\nAlarming conversations I've had with students make it impossible for me to ignore these statistics. Following a university screening of a rough-cut of one of my documentaries, \"Cojot,\" two freshmen sheepishly told me they'd \"never heard of this.\" I assured them few have heard of French business consultant Michel Cojot's quest to kill his father's Nazi executioner.\n\nShaking their heads, the freshmen said they'd \"never heard about any of this.\"\n\nThey were talking about the Holocaust.\n\nThe encounter sent me on a mission of my own: help fulfill Holocaust education's promise. I started by contemplating what knowledge, insights, and skills their students must obtain to put antisemitism and Islamophobia in the rearview mirror.\n\nA couple of observations informed my thinking about the knowledge part of the equation: Traditional Holocaust education's emphasis on disseminating historical facts has generated disappointing results and, in the long run, even A-students retain only a fraction of the information they absorb in school. They ofttimes memorize a lesson, regurgitate it on a test, then discard it from their brains.\n\nSo I focused on insights and skills, which tend to be stickier. An understanding of how democracies function and malfunction can stay with children and adolescents for life, sharpening their worldview and lending them a moral compass. Critical thinking, fact-finding, and active listening can boost empathy and productive civic discourse, enabling students to better navigate the present, past, and future.\n\nIn building this approach, I combined old methods in a new way. For a pedagogical anchor, I turned to practitioner inquiry, also called action research. This well-regarded yet underutilized professional development (PD) mechanism helps K-12 teachers examine and improve their practice. I hypothesized that although it was rarely if ever used in such a way, practitioner inquiry would upgrade Holocaust education when fitted with four lenses: contextual responsiveness, which enables educators to make their lessons relevant to the here and now; trauma-informed, which steers them away from age-inappropriate material and assists them in identifying and coping with trauma in their classrooms and schools; apolitical educational equity, which values every child and adolescent; and asset-based, which directs teachers' attention to their students and communities' strengths.\n\nTo test this properly, I founded the nonpartisan, pedagogically orientated Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights Education Initiative at Penn State. It provides PD programs in five states and counting to K-12 educators, many of whom know what but not how to effectively teach difficult topics.\n\nThe first rule of the initiative -- to borrow a phrase from David Fincher's \"Fight Club\" -- is you do not have to talk about the Holocaust. Research my colleagues and I have conducted indicates the effective instruction of any difficult topic, be it slavery or evolution or gender, can get at the Holocaust's underlying causes.\n\nParticipants in the initiative's programs, who represent various roles, disciplines, and grade levels, choose a difficult topic from their curriculum or community. They learn to teach it confidently by conjuring up compelling questions, finding credible sources, collecting and analyzing data, examining the findings with experts and colleagues, drawing up an implementation plan, and applying it in their classrooms and schools. Thus, they meet their students where they are in authentic ways.\n\nOur participants, who include nearly as many music and biology as social studies and English teachers, empower their students to come up with their own guiding questions and seek the truth and its implications for themselves. To teach in this unconventional manner, educators must shift from acting as sages on the stage to setting the stage for their students' experiential learning.\n\nThis mindset change typically requires a mind-twisting effort. Why would teachers -- already overburdened meeting state, district, and parental expectations -- add this to their trays? Their motivations range from resetting the tone in their classroom to removing the perception of indoctrination to redefining student success. A longtime elementary school teacher, for instance, aimed to make her Civil War lessons more thought-provoking. \"I was interested in ways to help my students think for themselves,\" she told me. And a mid-career middle-school teacher sought to instill empathy in her seventh-graders. Referencing Jim Crow and Nazi propaganda, she challenged her students to investigate her thesis that \"if you spend enough time talking negatively about people, you start to believe it.\"\n\nShe tasked her students with logging \"everything they said and heard in one day.\" The hands-on assignment opened the seventh-graders' eyes and, eventually, hearts. They reported hearing numerous hurtful judgements and \"conversations about fighting,\" the middle-school teacher said. \"The data collected were overwhelmingly negative.\" In the following weeks, the students \"wanted to talk about it more\" and grew to \"understand why they do what they do and reassess what they say about each other.\"\n\nMuch of K-12 looks far into the future. Ace biology or math now and become a doctor or coder later. Difficult topics inquiry offers students immediately useful takeaways. The empathy and active-listening skills they develop can enrich their inner and social lives. The two-way respect they forge with peers and adults can bolster their communications and self-esteem.\n\nTo give students a brighter outlook, individually and collectively, and fortify our democracy, we must reinvent how we teach difficult topics. We must trust students to chart a constructive course for themselves and society. This will forge a sense of control that can propel students on journeys of discovery, during which they learn to conduct primary research, triangulate the information they gather, seek multiple perspectives, and dialogue and debate with classmates. Ultimately, too, it would prompt our next generation to wonder why any student ever chose echo-chamber scorn over face-to-face, heated-yet-respectful civic discourse.", "source": {"uri": "time.com",

I can buy meat, fruit, and vegetables and don't feel the lack of food like I did during my youth,\" Vinogradov explained.\n\nDedicated to their mission\n\nAccording to the organization, \"supporting and caring for Holocaust survivors is at the very heart of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews 40-year mission.\"\n\n\"Our responsibility, and the responsibility of hundreds of thousands of supporters around the world, is to care for this community, with dignity and respect, in every way possible while we still have the chance,\" explained Yael Eckstein, President of the IFCJ.\n\nEckstein then elaborated on her firm commitment to continue the organization's work for as long as it can.\n\n\"We will make sure that Holocaust survivors are not forgotten and are provided with at least their basic needs until that tragic day when the last one leaves our world. These people suffered the worst and experienced unspeakable sacrifices and loss, and we owe it to them to spread the message of 'Never Again' through action in a way that honors their lives,\" Eckstein concluded.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fellowship_of_Christians_and_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Fellowship of Christians and Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yael_Eckstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yael Eckstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Community", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Community", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/595472", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Eight decades after the Holocaust, Diaspora Jews still live in fear, and their Israeli brethren are fighting for their lives. These days, the images of the Holocaust are resurfacing even more clearly; the barbarity of the Islamists reinforces the anguish, and the future seems uncertain.\n\nEurope, which in July 1938 had been indifferent to the fate of the Jewish refugees who had survived the Anschluss, seemed to be ignorant of the true intentions of the Nazi beast. It blindly accepted it, integrated it into society without constraints, thought to master it and tame it as in the past, in the colonial era. Due to a lack of leadership and political will, Europe today is plunging into the abyss, powerless and slowly sinking.\n\nIn the Islamic world, Holocaust deniers, led by Iran, deny the very existence of the Holocaust. \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\" the anti-Semitic Russian forgery published in 1898, and Hitler's dastardly book \"Mein Kampf\" are widely circulated in the Islamic world. The Israel Defense Forces found copies in the tunnels of the Gaza Strip.\n\nEuropean Islamist-leftist intellectuals dare to follow the Shi'ite banner of the ayatollahs and raise their heads arrogantly. Paul Rassinier's book \"The Lie of Ulysses,\" published in 1950, five years after the occupation of Germany, serves today as a reference for extreme-left activists.\n\nSince Oct. 7, the nauseating slogans of the Nazis have been rebroadcast with impunity. The same anti-Semitic terms are repeated:\n\n\"Zionists are dishonest. Their Jewishness is a big lie. They have no religion. They are a handful of lying, power-hungry individuals. Through their control of regimes, financial centers and information and propaganda agencies in the United States and Europe, they believe they run the world.\"\n\nDaily, Iran's leaders call for the destruction of the Jewish state by all means, including nuclear weapons. The members of the United Nations have never condemned Iran's unequivocal incitement to genocide.\n\nThe free world should be more understanding of Israel's security, daily struggles, sufferings and the misfortunes of the Jews' painful past. Israel's people refute pity, and they are not unhappy. It will defend itself alone, but with each threat, in the face of each war, and especially since Oct. 7, Israel has been living in the anguish of its post-trauma disorder -- the Holocaust syndrome.\n\nIsrael is turning into a besieged ghetto, and its borders into the Auschwitz fences. Inward-looking, Israel's intransigent views regarding defensible borders and security are natural phenomena and should be taken into account in all negotiations for the release of hostages held in Gaza as well as in the peace process with Israel's Arab neighbors.\n\nHowever, despite the barbarity of the Holocaust then and of Hamas today, the Israeli people have managed to maintain a human face. Israel's implacable justice is always imbued with a universal morality, those of the values of the Bible and Judaism.\n\nThe Holocaust must not be used as a pretext, an alleged reason to hide problems and conflicts, or a kind of alibi for failing to feel solidarity and empathy for the misfortunes of others, especially Israel's neighbors. The sons and daughters of Holocaust survivors are always capable of making painful concessions to achieve a just and sincere peace. Israel's strength is to be able, in pain and suffering, to remain generous, to pray for the happiness of all without distinction, and to pursue the path of peace and justice against all odds.\n\nIt is also important not to confuse a campaign denouncing Israeli policy in the territories with antisemitism. It is legitimate to criticize an Israeli government policy. European countries such as France, Great Britain, and Germany are not antisemitic countries today, but unfortunately, many notorious antisemites and Holocaust deniers in these countries must be challenged.\n\nAlthough laws have been passed, only severe sanctions, unrelenting vigilance, and, above all, an educational program at all levels can put an end to Holocaust denial, the revival of antisemitism, and new threats.\n\nThe anchoring of morality and the memory of the victims will not allow the Holocaust to be forgotten. Put a definitive end to cowardice, barbarism and genocide so that it doesn't happen again.

It is a solemn day, beginning at sunset on the 27th of the month of Nisan and ending the following evening, according to the traditional Jewish custom of marking a day. Places of entertainment are closed and memorial ceremonies are held throughout the country. The central ceremonies, in the evening and the following morning, are held at Yad Vashem and are broadcast live. Marking the start of the day-in the presence of the President of the State of Israel and the Prime Minister, dignitaries, survivors, children of survivors and their families who gather together with the general public to take part in the memorial ceremony at Yad Vashem in which six torches, representing the six million murdered Jews, are lit.\n\nThe following morning, the ceremony at Yad Vashem begins with the sounding of a siren for two minutes throughout the entire country. For the duration of the sounding, work is halted, people walking in the streets stop, cars pull off to the side of the road and everybody stands at silent attention in reverence to the victims of the Holocaust. Afterward, the focus of the ceremony at Yad Vashem is the laying of wreaths at the foot of the six torches, by dignitaries and the representatives of survivor groups and institutions. Other sites of remembrance in Israel, such as the Ghetto Fighters' Kibbutz and Kibbutz Yad Mordechai, also host memorial ceremonies, as do schools, military bases, municipalities and places of work. Throughout the day, both the television and radio broadcast programs about the Holocaust. In recent years, other countries and Jewish communities have adopted Yom Hashoah, the 27th of Nisan, to mark their own day of memorial for the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nHolocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Day 2024 will be on Monday, May 6th. The State Opening Ceremony will be held at Yad Vashem on Sunday, May 5th at 20:00.\n\nThe Central Theme for Holocaust Remembrance Day 2024\n\nA Lost World: The Destruction of the Jewish Communities\n\nThe Jewish community, a unique, autonomous social unit that characterized Jewish existence in the Diaspora through the ages, was dealt a fatal blow by the Holocaust. Thousands of prewar Jewish communities had served as a fundamental and critical framework in the lives of the Jewish people.\n\nThe Jewish community, a unique, autonomous social unit that characterized Jewish existence in the Diaspora through the ages, was dealt a fatal blow by the Holocaust. Thousands of prewar Jewish communities had served as a fundamental and critical framework in the lives of the Jewish people.\n\nThe Rabbinic adage, \"All Jews are responsible for one another\" was not a mere recommendation, but rather a practical axiom according to which traditional Jewish communities shaped their institutions and by which their leaders abided. A community's authority encompassed all aspects of life and mandated the complete allegiance of its members. From the moment of their birth until their final breath, in joy and in sorrow, Jews were affiliated with their communal institutions, which provided them with an identity, and a social, educational, religious and economic network via such established organizations as synagogues, courts of law, Mikvaot (ritual baths), and shelters for the sick and the impoverished. Community figures represented their members vis-\u00e0-vis the authorities and served as a conduit of information from those authorities back to the community. Despite the singularity of each Jewish community in Christian Europe and the Islamic countries, there were marked similarities in the structure and operation of the various communities.\n\nThe modern era brought with it dramatic changes in the characteristics and behavioral patterns of the Jewish community, due to the forces of modernization and the intervention of governmental authorities. In many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean basin, a new form of Jewish community emerged: a \"congregation of ritual observance\", focused primarily upon the accommodation of its members' religious requirements, alongside provision of their social and economic needs. This shift strengthened the status of the Rabbi, and the importance of synagogues and Batei Midrash (houses of learning), which became the principal communal institutions.\n\nAlongside such religious communities, there evolved, from the end of the 18th century and henceforth. alternatives to the traditional community. In Eastern Europe, Hasidic courts arose and regional Yeshivot (Talmudic academies) were established, the first of which opened in Volozhin in 1803. At the same time, figures from the \"Jewish Enlightenment\" movement labored to provide reformed social networks to the Jewish community. These communities did not require official recognition by the authorities, as their strength derived from the traditional connection between religious faith and social structure.\n\nFrom the mid-19th century, a diverse ideological, political and national consciousness was awakened amongst the Jews, giving rise to a new sense of collective identity. This consciousness influenced the nature of the Jewish community and was expressed in the creation of new voluntary social frameworks that served as a modern, secular alternative to religious communal existence, in effect creating a civic society.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, the Jewish communities in the shtetls, mellahs, villages, towns and cities in the East and West were replete with philanthropic institutions, political parties, welfare and mutual assistance frameworks, representative bodies that liaised with the authorities and non-Jewish society, Jewish trade unions and immigrant organizations. These in turn facilitated the proliferation of educational and cultural institutions, youth movements, sports clubs, libraries, newspapers, theaters, orchestras and choirs. This abundance existed alongside the traditional Jewish institutions: synagogues, religious courts, Mikvaot, educational frameworks such as the Heder (Hebrew school), Talmud Torah (elementary school) and Beit Midrash, charitable institutions and the Hevra Kaddisha (burial society).\n\nWith the rise of the Nazis to power in Germany, and subsequently upon the establishment of German hegemony over most of Europe and large parts of North Africa, Jewish society was forcibly plunged into an extreme reality. Faced with persecution and daily terror, the Jews fought tenaciously to preserve their physical and spiritual existence. Their sense of shared destiny, mutual responsibility and solidarity persisted as the cornerstones of Jewish communal life, even during the Holocaust.\n\nThe establishment of the ghettos in Eastern Europe, as a consequence of Germany's policy of segregation and isolation of the Jews, turned each Jewish community into a distinct, closed administrative unit, cut-off one from the other communities and from their surroundings. Throughout the conquered lands, many veteran Jewish leaderships ceased functioning, and were replaced by new communal administrations, imposed by the Germans. From then on, community leaders were forced to implement the orders of the German Nazi regime, and were made responsible for a wide range of functions that had routinely been handled by governmental and municipal institutions: food supply, employment, housing, health and sanitation, and even spheres that had previously been antithetical to the Diaspora Jewish heritage, such as the police and prisons. At the same time, the community continued to bear its previous responsibilities of accommodating religious needs, and providing education, welfare and burial services.\n\nThe systematic murder campaign waged against the Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators inflicted utter devastation upon thousands of communities in the German-occupied areas of Europe and North Africa; entire communities were decimated, and in many cases were totally obliterated.\n\nThe post-Holocaust Jewish world found itself in a jarringly harsh new reality: millions of Jews had been murdered, and with them, an array of venerable communal institutions and a wealth of Jewish civilization had been obliterated. In many locations, survivors attempted, as best they could, to reconstitute and renew their communities. In Israel and other countries to which survivors immigrated, many formed Landsmannschaften, associations of survivors from specific places that served as communities of remembrance for many years after most of their original members had been murdered, their institutions destroyed and their survivors dispersed all over the world.\n\nHundreds of destroyed communities were commemorated in Yizkor (memorial) books. This was a monumental enterprise initiated by Holocaust survivors, together with community members who had left Europe before World War II in order to commemorate a glorious chapter of Jewish history: the Diaspora community.\n\nThe legacy of the Jewish community is one of the most magnificent and cherished treasures that Jewish history has bequeathed to us. The destruction of the communities during the Holocaust is a deep wound inflicted upon the body and soul of the Jewish people. Delving into the history of the Jewish community and studying its destruction helps to illustrate the enormity of the calamity and the catastrophic loss suffered by the Jewish people during and following the Shoah.

The pain, suffering, and evil associated with the Holocaust -- driven by Antisemitic ideology -- must always be remembered and taught to ensure \"never again.\"\n\nSadly, eight decades later, Antisemitism -- and hate in general -- is on the rise in our country and around the world.\n\nOn October 7, Hamas, a brutal terrorist organization, committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust -- killing 1,200 innocent people, including 44 Americans, taking 240 people hostage, including eight Americans still in Gaza, and committing horrific acts of sexual violence against Jewish women.\n\nAnd, in recent days in the United States, we have seen hateful rhetoric and harassment against Jews. This is Antisemitism and must be condemned unequivocally. Hate of any kind has no place in our country.\n\nFor the Jewish people, the past seven months have evoked the memories -- along with fear and anguish -- of the Holocaust. So to all the Jewish people around the world, know this: President Joe Biden and I stand with you. We will fight Antisemitism with the full force of the U.S. government, including through the first-ever National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. We will continue to stand with the people of Israel and its right to defend itself from those that threaten its existence. And we remain committed to Holocaust remembrance and education.\n\nLike many Jewish Americans, my husband Doug has learned the harrowing stories of his family members that perished in the Holocaust. Last year, he traveled to the town where some of them lived in what is now Poland, and heard stories of family members shot and others who were deported to an unknown fate. He walked through the old Jewish Quarter of Krakow. And he visited Auschwitz-Birkenau, and the gas chambers, to bear witness.\n\nToday, I also reflect on Doug's great-grandparents who fled persecution in what is now Poland at the turn of the 20th century and were able to build a life in America. Ultimately, the Jewish people persevered. And Jewish traditions continue to be passed down from one generation to next -- including at the Vice President's Residence, where Doug and I have been proud to hang mezuzahs, light menorahs, and host Passover seders. And with each of these actions, we send a message to the world: the Jewish people can overcome evil. We can and we must stand strong in the face of hate.", "source": {"uri": "whitehouse.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "The White House"}, "authors": [{"uri": "white_house@whitehouse.gov", "name": "White House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israelites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_HaNassi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beit HaNassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezuzah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mezuzah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Quarter_(Jerusalem)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passover Seder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chamber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gas chamber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak\u00f3w", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krak\u00f3w"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Krak\u00f3w"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/wh_social-share.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 449, "textEnd": 458}], "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

We can never bring back the people we lost, and we can never bring closure to the stories left unfinished. Many of the survivors and their descendants are still living with the trauma of what happened. That's why we must take the time to remember the past, however painful it may be, because it also reminds us of our perpetual obligation to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.\n\n\"This year, we mark Yom HaShoah and its message at a time when Jewish communities are still reeling from the events of October 7, 2023. Hamas's brutal terrorist attacks against Israel were the deadliest against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Canada unequivocally condemns these attacks and anyone who glorifies the indefensible actions of Hamas. Hamas members are neither freedom fighters nor resistance fighters. They are terrorists.\n\n\"Since October 7, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world have been faced with a disturbing rise in anti-Semitism. This situation is unacceptable and must not continue. Whether they attend a synagogue or a Jewish business or school, or choose to wear the Star of David or a yarmulke, Jewish Canadians deserve to feel welcomed, supported and safe. They deserve to live their Jewish lives openly and proudly, without fear or intimidation.\n\n\"To Jewish Canadians: know that we stand by you. Our solidarity with you and our commitment to your safety are unwavering. We will continue to take steps to protect you and to raise awareness of anti-Semitism. In Budget 2024, we announced the creation of a new National Holocaust Remembrance Program, a permanent program with a budget of $5 million. This program will support initiatives to preserve the memory of the Holocaust and help more Canadians learn more about the atrocities and anti-Semitism that gave rise to it. The Budget also invests more than $273 million over six years to implement Canada's Action Plan to Combat Hate, including more than $29 million to combat hate crimes and strengthen community safety. Finally, we are renewing funding for Canada's National Holocaust Monument to increase its visibility and activities so that it can reach even more communities across the country.\n\n\"Today and every day, we honor and celebrate the courage and resilience of Jewish Canadians and the Jewish people. As ceremonies are held in schools, synagogues and community centers across the country, I encourage Canadians to denounce anti-Semitism and pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust.\n\n\"Let us never forget. Together, we say never again.\"\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

Fliss was followed by Lia Stermer, who was born in a concentration camp in 1942, in what is today Ukraine; and then Irene Klass who survived the horrors of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nPaul Herskovits, who was slipped off an extermination train at the age of 21 years old, lit the fifth candle. His parents were sent to the death camp and he was hidden in the Budapest Ghetto. Rabbi Joseph Matzner lit the final candle. He was forced to hide, first in the forests of Vichy, France, and then for three years in a convent and then with a Catholic family, before being reunited with his family.\n\nThe final testimony was offered by Rena Quint in a video testimony she recorded with SAJBD national director Wendy Kahn. Born in Poland and interned in a concentration camp by the age of five, Rena Quint would lose six mother figures by the time she was 10 - all murdered by the Nazis.\n\n\"In Majdanek and in Auschwitz,\" she remembered, \"you smelt the gas.

The annual remembrance day began Sunday evening and ends today.\n\nThe event was hosted by the Canton Jewish Community Federation, Temple Israel, Agudas Achim Congregation and Shaaray Torah Synagogue.\n\n\"Portrait of Injustice: Train to Auschwitz\" included readings, music, poetry and the lighting of the yahrzeit, memorial candles on behalf of victims and survivors.\n\nDuring World War II, the Nazis systematically murdered 11 million people, including 6 million Jews and 1 million children. Survivors were relegated to slave labor, barely subsisting on near-starvation diets. They were liberated by the Allied forces in 1945.\n\nA story of survival Stark's last Holocaust survivor continues to 'bear witness'\n\n\"It was always difficult for my parents, but they always shared the stories,\" Boren said, adding that they were interviewed for Steven Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation project, which has recorded the stories of thousands of survivors.\n\nTemple Israel Rabbi David Komerofsky noted that although it's been 80 years since the Holocaust, it remains relevant.\n\n\"Yom HaShoah matters even more when the Holocaust moves from personal memory to the pages of history,\" he said. \"Like Passover, which enshrines a communal memory through ritual, Holocaust Memorial Day is a collective expression of grief and remembrance.\"\n\nBenny and Bella Boren, Holocaust survivors\n\nBoren said his parents, Benny and Bella Boren, grew up in Kielce, Poland. All of their siblings, as well as their parents, perished.\n\nPolish Jews experienced antisemitism even before the Holocaust, he said.\n\n\"Both my parents said they hated Tuesdays. In public schools, Tuesday was when they had a one-hour religious class and they were separated out from the other kids, the Gentiles, so they didn't attend religious class. After class, (non-Jews) would come out an verbally and physically abuse the Jewish kids, screaming at them, 'You killed our Christ.' That was just part of the abuse. The Poles were notoriously antisemitic.\"\n\nWhen the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, Boren said his parents and other Jews in that country were herded into unsanitary \"ghettos,\" their homes and businesses confiscated. In 1941, the ghettos were sealed shut, forcing inhabitants to barter for food, or try to sneak out to find it.\n\n\"One night, my mother went out and was caught and jailed,\" he said. \"She really thought they were going to kill her because if you'd get caught smuggling, you'd be put to death. Somehow, the Jewish committee was able to get her out of jail the next morning.\"\n\nBoren said that in 1942, the Nazis liquidated the ghetto, sending most of its inhabitants to Treblinka, a notorious extermination camp. His parents were sent to Auschwitz in 1944.\n\n'If you could work, you could survive'\n\n\"Once they got to Auschwitz, they were stripped of all their belongings and had their heads shaved,\" he said. \"They were given uniforms - too big, too small - and shoes that didn't match. My father said he felt it was intentional. They did everything they could to dehumanize them.\"\n\nBoren said his parents told him the showers at Auschwitz became a place of terror, not knowing if water or poison gas would be released.\n\n\"If you could work, you could survive,\" Boren said. \"My parents said they never had enough to eat. They said they didn't have enough to live on, but it was too much to die.\"\n\nIn 1945, as the end loomed for Germany, the Nazis started liquidating the camps, forcing prisoners to go on \"death marches\" in subzero weather. Those who did not die but couldn't keep up were shot.\n\n\"A lot of them didn't make it,\" Boren said.\n\n\"My mother was transferred to Bergen-Belsen where she was liberated,\" Boren said. \"My father went to Nordhausen, where he worked on the V2 rocket ... My dad said that if he wasn't a coward, he would have committed suicide. They both said they prayed they wouldn't wake up.\"\n\nBoren noted that when British liberators brought food into the camps, some died from overeating.\n\n\"My mother was too sick with typhus, so she didn't eat; she stayed in the barracks,\" Boren said. \"My dad thought it wasn't safe so he didn't eat the food.\"\n\nBoren said his sick mother was watched over in the barracks by the sister of a woman she had helped along the death march.\n\n\"One day she noticed that my mother wasn't in the barracks, so she went looking for her,\" he said. \"There were stacks of corpses outside the crematorium, which was backed up. Her friend came out, saw her there, picked her up and carried her into the barracks and saved her.\"\n\n'Nothing has changed'\n\nBoren said his parents married in Germany in 1946. His older brother was born in Munich in 1947. In 1949, the family emigrated to U.S., where he was born.\n\nBoren said his father wanted to revisit Poland. His mother did not.\n\nHe recalls being harassed by their blue-collar neighbors in Flint, Mich. Jewish slurs were \"commonplace. I didn't want anyone to know I was Jewish until I was in college,\" he admitted. \"It bothers me that I didn't speak up.\"\n\nDespite their ordeal, Benny Boren lived to be 91. Bella Boren lived to be 93.\n\nTeaching the next generation 'We've got to stop the hate.' Chadash Academy offers Jewish children support, education\n\nBoren said he doesn't believe antisemitism has increased, merely reports of it have.\n\n\"I strongly believe it's just come out of the closet,\" he said. \"There's been antisemitism for centuries. Nothing has changed, in my opinion. What I find very troubling is Jews who support political agendas that threaten Israel and, ultimately, their existence.\"\n\nKomerofsky said it's essential that the Holocaust not be forgotten.\n\n\"As World War II recedes from individual memory, the meaning of the rituals associated with honoring those who died, changes,\" Komerofsky said. \"To make the analogy clear - we cannot afford to distance ourselves from the story just because it did not happen to us personally. We must live as if we were there.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.cantonrep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Repository"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canton_repository@eu.cantonrep.com", "name": "Canton

Show some respect. Ceasefire now!\"\n\nThousands of Jews, including Holocaust survivors affected by the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, walked through the former Auschwitz death camp on Monday for the annual March of the Living.\n\nWalking along the 1.8 mile path towards the crematoria of Birkenau, they paid tribute to the millions of Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War Two.\n\nThis year's ceremony was overshadowed by last year's events when 1,200 people were killed in a Hamas-led rampage through Israeli towns and 253 hostages taken by terrorists.\n\nDaniel Louz, 90, saw his hometown Kibbutz Beeri lose a tenth of its residents to the terror group last year.\n\nHe now came to the Auschwitz camp for the first time since his mother's family was killed there in 1942.\n\nLouz said: \"I am convinced that on October 7 in Beeri the good souls (of the Holocaust dead) protected me and did not let the Hamas criminals shoot at our home.\n\n\"So that I might be able to tell the story. I am really thankful to you all.\"\n\nMore than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, perished in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Germans set up in occupied Poland during the Second World War.\n\nMore than three million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust.\n\nPhyllis Greenberg Heideman, president of the International March of the Living, said during Monday's event: \"Prior to October 7 it is my belief ... that the worst event in human history happened on these grounds.\n\n\"That this place, the very word Auschwitz, speaks volumes in one word about fear, death, destruction, annihilation.\n\n\"And then came October 7, and perhaps we have to come as a people to the realisation that perhaps in some ways the Shoah (Holocaust) isn't over for us.\n\n\"It's not a competition, certainly not a comparison, it's a continuum.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) are continuing to gear up for their immense six-week assault on Rafah to once and for all eliminate any remaining Hamas terrorists in a final battle.\n\nIsrael warned that residents still trapped in the Gazan city will be used as \"human shields\" by Hamas thugs if they don't evacuate the war-torn city immediately.\n\nIsrael's defence minister warned on Sunday that an invasion of refugee-filled Rafah is imminent after a ceasefire deal crumbled due to Hamas' demands.\n\nBodies have already been piling up on the streets of Rafah as reports of dogs feasting on the corpses have started to emerge as the city awaits an almighty siege.\n\nYoav Gallant warned his government was preparing to launch \"a powerful operation in the very near future in Rafah and other places across all of Gaza\".\n\nSome 1.5million civilians are sheltering in Rafah, with most having fled from cities, refugee camps, and villages further north.\n\nLess than half of the 250 hostages snatched by militants on October 7 have been released in the seven months since Hamas launched its assault on Israel, though many are believed to have died in captivity.\n\nThe United Nations have warned any assault on Rafah could spark a bloodbath for helpless civilians.\n\nNations including the UK and the US are also pushing to avert a Rafah offensive.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType":

This tragedy is one of the most abominable events in human history.\n\nOn this day of remembrance and introspection, we vow never to forget the victims of the Holocaust. More than 6 million Jewish people - men, women and children - were tortured, persecuted and murdered by the Nazi regime and its acolytes. Half a million Roma and other members of vulnerable minority communities, including people with disabilities, suffered the same fate. This very dark chapter of the past carries intergenerational trauma for people in many countries, including Canada.\n\nYom HaShoah is a time to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and to offer support to their descendants. We salute those who work every day to ensure that the Holocaust and its devastating effects are never denied, minimized, distorted or forgotten. The Government of Canada is determined to combat the rise of anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial. That's why, in Budget 2024, we allocated more than $273 million to Canada's future Action Plan to Combat Hate, which also includes funding to support the mandate of the Special Envoy for Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism.\n\nIn addition, the 2024 budget also provides for the creation of a new national Holocaust remembrance program. This will support projects aimed at keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive and improving understanding and attitudes towards anti-Semitism.\n\nWe invite you to learn more about the Shoah and its aftermath, to discover the stories of those who survived and those who disappeared, and to reflect on the prejudice and hatred that caused these atrocities.

Brutally crushed, the ghetto was liquidated, leading to the slaughter of over 50,000 Jews who were killed during the fighting or murdered afterwards, industrially in camps. My mother and grandmother had escaped a month earlier on forged identity papers; a great uncle, Jan, and his 11-year-old son, Artur, were murdered after their own attempt to flee failed.\n\nSince October 7th, events in Israel and Gaza have inevitably led to commentary across the political, legal and media spheres, invoking the Holocaust. How can this false equivalence be countered; how can protecting the narrative of the Holocaust and the sober memorialisation of the victims continue against the current front of outrage? Where and to whom do we look to for an equilibrium to counter the extremes of violence, horror and fear that many of us witness and feel, on screens and viscerally in our hearts?\n\nThe Irish media, including writers for this newspaper, have too easily sought to equate the unbearably harsh predicament of the Gazans with those of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis and their proxies 80 years ago. Here lies the road to perdition.\n\nWhatever injustice, historic and current, that successive Israeli governments have served to the Palestinians, there is no resonance with the Holocaust. The worst government in Israeli history it may be, but the Netanyahu regime is not deporting Palestinians and gassing them systematically in purpose-built camps as Jews were, from all over Europe, to be exterminated because they were Jews.\n\nSuch comparisons undermine Jewish propriety of the Holocaust, wittingly or otherwise, distorting the narrative and eroding sympathy for the victims. This is the murky habitat of the Holocaust Denier, in all its despicable variations.\n\nIsraelis are simplistically cast as Jews and then recast as Nazis. The implication is that the victims deserved their fate during the Holocaust after all, and the anti-Semites feel vindicated; none of which contributes to the Palestinian cause.\n\nNumerous commentators have invoked the term \"irony\" when describing the fact that the 1948 Genocide Convention was established so that the world would never again allow the atrocities against the Jews during the Holocaust to happen again. Now Israel is in the dock accused of breaking the same convention. Irony?\n\nAs already stated, the world allowed six million Jews, two thirds of European Jewry to be systematically murdered on the basis of their ethnicity. In Ireland, as in most countries, there was no outcry, no marches and, other than the UK, almost no help. The inability to distinguish the two sets of circumstances, to distinguish Jews from Israelis and Israelis from an historically unpopular government dismisses the complexities of history and dishonours its victims.\n\nNetanyahu has often cynically invoked the Holocaust throughout his career in politics; rather like Donald Trump, there is nothing too sacred to hijack, insult or dismantle if it's obstructing his political ambition.\n\nThe conflicting needs of a far-right Israeli government, a ruthless, genocidal and maniacal Hamas regime in Gaza, a weak, tired and corrupt Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the malignant theocracy in Tehran has brought terror to Israel and Gaza.\n\nMany Israelis fear that a co-ordinated attack by Iran and its proxies could annihilate the state, a fear made all too real by the missile attacks on April 13th. For Jews, such an extreme outcome is not difficult to imagine; the Holocaust remains in living memory.\n\nI was invited to join PAKH, the study group for intergenerational consequences of the Holocaust, last September. Comprising the descendants of victims and perpetrators, we meet to discuss our impossibly complex family stories.\n\nRecently, online, we listened to Israeli Rami Elhanan and Palestinian Bassam Aramin explain how they work together to promote peace. The subjects of Colum McCann's 2020 novel, Apeirogon, these heroic men each lost a daughter in the decades-long conflict. Their determination to focus on the importance of respecting the rights of the individual, their lack of self pity and how they have come to rely on each other, emotionally, is humbling to observe.\n\nBoth men possess the insight of inherited trauma, along with their own piercing personal loss. Bassam's stems from the displacement of his people, Rami's mother was, as he says laconically, a graduate of Auschwitz. They both agree that the absence of Palestinian self-determination was the reason they lost their children and that Israeli society entire needs a total reset. It's clear to them that both Hamas in Gaza and the settlers who have taken over the Israeli cabinet are a disaster for both peoples.\n\nTheir codependency recalls the circumstances of numerous concentration camp inmates who often survived because they had a relative or friend to share the struggle of each day. There are tragic cases of survivors dying shortly after liberation; the dream of freedom being too physically overwhelming when it finally came.\n\nThese two remarkably dignified, emotionally literate men are the embodiment of Viktor Frankl's maxim that to understand your own pain you must first help someone else understand theirs; and that when pain has meaning, it is no longer pain. Bassam says they are not friends but are brothers. They show us what is required to break the cycle of hatred. Rami was clear that it's not necessary for Palestinians and Israelis to love each other but respect is the key.\n\nThe small matter of Iran's policy of destabilising Israel was not touched on, nor the explosion in anti-Semitism since October 7th. A resolution between Israel and the Palestinians would remove an issue that unifies Iran's allies against Israel and would expose the regime in Tehran for the oppressive, misogynistic and morally bankrupt entity that it has become.\n\nMore Sunni states would join the alliance with Israel and Iran would become even more isolated. Most importantly, given the current crisis, Israelis and Palestinians would feel safe for the first time. Public expressions of anti-Semitism would also recede.\n\nAs I think of the hostages and their tortured families and weep for the broken generations in Gaza, I accept with an open heart that, among my fellow PAKH members, I have come to love and embrace children and grandchildren of monsters. And this, in the Ashkenazi tradition of trying to repair the world, headache by headache. On Yom HaShoah, I sense this is the furthest point from despair that a heart like mine can travel within the boundaries of this difficult inheritance.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType":

I was sitting in the basement of my house, rockets were exploding outside and I was talking on the phone with people who were shouting, 'Where is the army? Why didn't it come?'. I thought of my father in another basement, the basement of the ghetto, a 14-year-old Jewish boy who knew there was no one to cry out to. There was no army to come save him,\" said Lapid, speaking of his father, Tommy Lapid, who was a Holocaust survivor.\n\n\"However, precisely there, precisely in the ghetto, hope did not die - it was born. On this Holocaust Memorial Day, in this place, I came to remind you not of the despair and horror, but of what happened only three years after the Holocaust. Three years after the ghetto, after the extermination camps - only three years later - a ship approached the port of Haifa, an orchestra of survivors played 'Hatikva' on board, an improvised flag was raised on the mast, and a 17-year-old boy named Tommy Lampel - later, Yosef Lapid - burst into tears of joy, went ashore and enlisted in the army, the Jewish army,\" he added.\n\n\"Where will we be in three years? Wherever we choose to be,\" continued Lapid. \"If the State of Israel sinks into hatred and fear, then our enemies have won. If we say to each other, 'We need to speak their language, because it's the only language they understand,' then it will become our language. This is what they want. This is what we must not give them.\"\n\n\"The Holocaust didn't only teach us that the Jews should have a state and an army. The Holocaust also taught us that this state should be good. You don't fight hate with hate. We won't be like them. We won't give them the pleasure. Since the Holocaust, we have been saying two things to the world: Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East; Israel is the strongest country in the Middle East. These two things lead to each other. We are strong because we are a democracy. We don't win in spite of our values, but because of them,\" he said.\n\n\"This day, this place, the survivors who founded it, taught us: You can always start over, you can always build better. We have the right and duty to choose a life of love and hope and the values of democracy, progress and freedom. Our life is not what happened to us, our life is what we make of it. Our life did not stay in the ghetto, we came here and were reborn. Our life is not the terrible massacre of October 7, but what we built and created as a response to this massacre.\"", "source": {"uri": "israelnationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel National News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hezki_baruch@israelnationalnews.com", "name": "Hezki Baruch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yair_Lapid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yair Lapid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghetto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lapid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Lapid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Mordechai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yad Mordechai"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Haifa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of Haifa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatikvah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hatikvah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extermination camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://a7.org/files/pictures/1200x930/1154126.jpg?autocrop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 124, "textEnd": 135, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

It teaches them to be good citizens. But kids can only learn from the past if they are taught it,\" says Marilyn Sinclair , founder of Holocaust education organization Liberation75. \"Ontario implemented Holocaust education in Grade 6 last year and it has been a tremendous success. This tells us that we need mandatory Holocaust and antisemitism education in Grade 6 in every province and territory.\"\n\nA new campaign by Liberation75 - Young Again/Never Again - uses A.I. technology to bring Holocaust survivors back to their younger selves to tell the powerful stories of what they lived through. The video and ad campaign calls on Ministers of Education to make Holocaust education mandatory in all schools starting in Grade 6 and will be used as a learning tool for teachers. The Holocaust survivors featured in Young Again/Never Again hope that students will learn from the mistakes of the past and protect freedom and democracy for all Canadians.\n\nIn September 2023 , Ontario was the first in Canada to add Holocaust and antisemitism education to the Grade 6 curriculum and will add it to the Grade 10 curriculum in 2025. Additionally, Holocaust education will become mandatory in Grade 7 in New Brunswick in 2024, and in Grade 10 in British Columbia , Yukon , and Saskatchewan , starting in 2025. In Nova Scotia , it is already part of the Grade 8 curriculum. Alberta and Manitoba have committed to mandatory Holocaust education but are still determining the details. Quebec , Newfoundland , Prince Edward Island , Northwest Territories , and Nunavut have yet to make a commitment or announcement.\n\nFor more information on Liberation75 visit: liberation75.org\n\nFor

How true is the #Holocaust and how did the Zionists benefit from it?\"\n\nReports, blogs and op-eds\n\nInstances of Holocaust denial can easily be found on Al Jazeera's website, left untouched for years and sometimes decades.\n\nFor instance, a 2002 article regarding the dismissal of a Syrian-born German minister following his likening of Israel to the Nazis, reported in a dry, allegedly objective tone, that Holocaust denial is \"the card that the Jews are still playing in Germany, which is still paying reparations to Israel for the alleged Holocaust.\"\n\nMore modern examples can also be found. For instance, a blog by writer Abdelkhaleq Mansour from March 2017, claims that \"There are many studies and writings that have refuted the claims of the leaders of the Zionist entity that Nazism killed millions of converts to the Jewish religion in Europe, and revealed the extent to which those who adopted the concept of Holocaust massacres exaggerated in narrating those events.\" He also added that a \"growing belief in the inaccuracy of these allegations, with the emergence of the concept of Holocaust revisionism, that is, research, writings, and people who believe that the actions of Nazism were not as horrific as those mentioned in the writings of the Jews.\" This passage includes both holocaust denial and a referral to the debunked, antisemitic Khazarian theory.\n\nA similar entry by Moroccan blogger Adel Ayashi from August 2018, claimed that \"Although the conflict with the Jews reached its climax after the mission of the Messenger, there are turning points in history in which Arabs and Muslims demonstrated profound humanity towards the persecuted Jews throughout the world. Numerous testimonies and general facts indicate that Muslims have demonstrated - despite the plots of the Jews against them - about their great chivalry in their defense of the Jews persecuted by Nazism specifically during World War II, and whether the alleged Holocaust was fact or fiction.\" In this passage, the writer manages to both deny the Holocaust, highlight historical hostility toward the Jews, and paint the Jews as a collective - as plotting and being ungrateful.\n\nSimilarly, Palestinian journalist Nael Abdulatif wrote a piece in Al Jazeera in June 2018 in which he criticized Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for \"apologizing on remarks he made regarding the alleged holocaust,\" thus inherently denying the holocaust and the need to preserve its memory.\n\nAnother more recent example is from early 2023, where a panel discussion hosted by the Qatari National Library featured Dr. Abaher Al-Saqa, who discussed in his speech \"the alleged Holocaust kept by the Zionist Jews... They have made a museum about the perishing or Holocaust which they claim [happened].\"\n\nOne final example is from December 2023, where a critical article made accusations that the Israeli film industry revolving around the Holocaust \"Ignores any reference to the complicit role of Zionism in the crimes, whether in the Nazi camps, or in the camps that the Allies established in Germany after the war, in which hundreds of thousands of Germans were killed, and some estimate the number in the millions.\" This accusation against Zionists - interchangeable with Jews - with imaginary wrongdoings is another form of antisemitic discourse salient on the Qatari-owned mouthpiece Al Jazeera.\n\nAn ideology of antisemitism\n\nHolocaust denial is not the only type of antisemitic discourse led by Qatar. Only last week, Qatari member of parliament Essa Al-Nassr expressed antisemitic and violent views, regarding Jews as \"killers of prophets\" and promising that the October 7th massacre was \"just a prelude,\" implying a supposed Godly promise to bring in Jews to the Holy Land so that Muslims can more easily defeat them.\n\nAdditionally, Qatar is perceived as a host nation of the Muslim Brotherhood axis, through sporting and promoting a wide array of religious institutions, political parties and even Western-based NGOs which promote what is known as political Islam or Islamism around the globe. The Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as key player in importing classical European antisemitic discourse into the Arab and Muslim spheres, with one of its main thinkers, founder of Salafi Jihadism, Syed Qutb, even writing a well-known pamphlet named \"Our Battle with the Jews.\"", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thousands of Jews march here to commemorate the genocide.\n\nHer thoughts, she says, are with her grandson, Yotam, a hostage who was killed accidentally by Israeli troops in Gaza along with two other Israelis who escaped captivity there after being abducted by terrorists on October 7.\n\nYotam, who was taken from Kibbutz Kfar Aza, spoke with her as terrorists were raiding the kibbutz, where they killed dozens of members, she recalls: \"He told me he can smell smoke and it transported me back to thinking about the Holocaust. The smell of Jewish homes burning.\"\n\nHaim, who was born in Poland in 1938 and settled in Kibbutz Gvulot in Israel's south, near the Gaza Strip, in 1951, says she is at Auschwitz to make a statement,.\n\n\"I'm here to show we are alive, we have risen from the Holocaust and we will rise again from October 7,\" she says.\n\nHaim is among several Holocaust survivors who are participating in the march and whose lives were directly impacted by the October 7 onslaught, along with Berlin-born Judith Tzamir from Kibbutz Mefalsim near Gaza and Danit Gabbai, who was born in Marrakech,

That's not to say every person protesting the invasion of Gaza hates Jews, but even these \"good\" people have chosen to side with evil.\n\nHamas is evil. Siding with Hamas is evil. And mocking Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Days on this day is monstrous.\n\nAs Holocaust survivors leave this mortal coil, some of their last experiences will be of the resurgence of hatred toward Jews, exemplified by monsters celebrating the murder of 6 million Jews in concentration camps. And, despite being in Poland, if you notice, some of the signs are in English--tailor-made for the American audience they are appealing to.\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators have sparked outrage after staging a protest near the grounds of Auschwitz - as Israelis including October 7 survivors marched to honour victims of the Holocaust.\n\nSirens wailed as protestors displayed a banner reading 'stop genocide' at groups wearing Israeli flags along the sidelines of the 'March of the Living' event, which brings together thousands annually to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day in silence.\n\nEyewitnesses claimed protestors were 'chanting' at participants on the march, with Israelis responding with lines from 'Am Israel chai', a Jewish solidarity anthem.\n\nSurvivors of Hamas' October 7 incursion into southern Israel were also in attendance as participants marched the two-mile (three kilometre) walk from Auschwitz to Birkenau, where approximately one million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\n\nJust last week, distressing footage invoked fury as a man filmed himself walking through the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Auschwitz and saying: 'You belong here. This is your place of origin. You left these camps and ghettos. Long live Palestine.'\n\nIran \"Death to America, Death to Israel\" is embracing the student protesters, and with good reason. America alone has the power to pressure Israel to relent, and that pressure is working. Biden, as I wrote earlier today, paused aid to Israel just moments after Congress approved another tranche. Biden used aid to Israel as a bargaining chip to get money for his friends in Ukraine--after all, they funneled millions into his son's pockets--and then shut off the flow of funds that were approved for Israel.\n\nAll this in the service of people who stand outside Auschwitz mocking the death of Jews.\n\nThe moral perversity of this protest is impossible to exaggerate. Wearing the yellow star outside the March for the Living is...there are no words adequate to describe this. Chanting at Holocaust survivors and their descendants.\n\nWhat is there to say, except \"If you are on the side of these people, you are on the side of the Devil himself.\"\n\nI think most Americans don't grasp the scale of the evil at this movement's heart. It is not about restoring peace but about waging a war against the Jews.\n\nSo many of the protesters are openly declaring their goal of committing atrocities against Jews forever, and yet people have told me that these are a few overexcitable people who are lost in the moment.\n\nYeah, right. They are demons. They aren't anti-genocide; they want a genocide of the Jews. Hamas keeps repeating that they want to kill Jews, and I am to believe they are harmless or that their apologists are decent, peace-loving people.\n\nNo.\n\nThere were few hecklers, so I shouldn't blow this out of proportion. I know that. But millions of people around the world are standing next to people displaying swastikas, distributing Hamas propaganda, calling Jews swine, and echoing Nazi propaganda.\n\nThat every decent American doesn't condemn these protests angers me. By that, I don't mean that every decent American should support Israel's war policies, although I wish they would. Strategy and tactics are perfectly legitimate areas of debate, and some people believe that war is never justified.\n\nBut no decent person should side with evil, and the pro-Palestinian movement is evil. Allying with it is...disgusting.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_strom@hotair.com", "name": "David Strom", "type": "author",

Mankind was given a glimpse of its ability to perpetrate evil to a previously unimaginable extent. After World War II, a new word, genocide, had to be invented to describe this level of depravity.\n\nYet even from the concentration camps, Dry Bones arose from people of faith who believed in the kindness and good that God had created in the souls and hearts of men.\n\nThe following eight stories are examples of people trying to heal the scars of the Holocaust.\n\nChristian Gift Restores Fortunes Prophesied in Jeremiah While Healing Holocaust Wounds\n\nWith 'Restoration Rings' made from silver and gold donated by pro-Israel Christians, one ministry sought to heal the painful wounds of the Holocaust and centuries of Christian persecution through fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy.\n\nCanadian Christians donated gold rings taken from their own hands, remaking them into rings to be placed on the fingers of Holocaust survivors who had their gold rings snatched from them as they entered the Nazi camps.\n\nGrandson of Nazi Soldier Returning Golden Menorah Stolen by Titus in 70 CE\n\nA small group of Christians' which included several descendants of Nazis set out to fix the theft of the golden menorah from the Temple by Titus in 70 CE. In addition, they are seeking to return some of the Divine love that has sustained Germany despite the horrific crimes perpetrated on the Jews in the Holocaust.\n\nTo bring about this vision, they created a 265-pound menorah replica of the Temple Menorah as it appears on the Arch of Titus in Rome and brought it to Israel, returning along the same route that it was stolen away.\n\nMarch of Nations: Descendants of Nazis stand with the Jews and Jerusalem\n\nThe March of Nations takes place in Jerusalem every year as a remarkable effort by the descendants of Nazis to make amends for the Holocaust. The march brings non-Jews from around the world in a unique event, celebrating Israel's eternal capital.\n\nCalling on Christians: Be a modern day Bonhoeffer; Fight Hamas\n\nOn November 9, the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht and one month after the horrific attack on Israel, Israel365 ran a program to train people who love Israel on how to battle for the survival of the Jewish nation in these difficult times. The response was overwhelming.\n\nGranddaughter of Nazis works to heal the wounds of the Holocaust at the UN\n\nWith two grandfathers who served in the Wehrmacht, Nazi Germany's army, in World War II, Claudia Kiesinger has devoted her life to healing the wounds of the Holocaust through her love of Israel.Kiesinger leads prayer groups in the United Nations in New York City, praying with Christians for Israel. She is also the US coordinator for the March of Life, a grassroots movement launched under the auspices of the Evangelical TOS Church in Tubingen, Germany.\n\nIsraeli, German Fighter Pilots to Conduct Joint Exercises Over Nazi Camp and Site of Murder of Israeli Olympic Athletes\n\nIsraeli fighter pilots made history in September 2020 when they conducted joint military exercises with their German counterparts over the Dachau concentration camp, where more than 30,000 Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, and the Olympic Village in Munich, where 11 Israeli athletes and their coaches were massacred in 1972 by Palestinian terrorists.\n\nChristian group stands up to neo-Nazi antisemitism in Florida\n\nA group of about 60 multi-faith protesters came out in support of the Jewish community at the intersection of State Road 40 and Beach Street in Ormond Beach, Florida to stand against antisemitic hate groups. The net result was that the neo-Nazis, who are becoming more visible in Florida, were a no-show.\n\nFriends reunite after 81 years of being separated by Nazis\n\nIn 1939, best friends Ana Mar\u00eda Wahrenberg and Betty Grebenschikoff were nine-years-old when their families were forced to flee Nazi Germany. They had made the painful decision after the Kristallnacht pogroms. After they separated, the two were unable to keep in touch. After the horrors of the Holocaust, they assumed the worst, believing their childhood friend to be one of the millions of victims.", "source": {"uri": "israel365news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel365 News | Latest News.

We can never bring back the lives lost. We can never finish the stories left incomplete. Many of those who survived and their descendants continue to live with the trauma of what occurred. It's why remembering the past - however painful - also reminds us of our eternal obligation to stop this from ever happening again.\n\n\"This year, Yom HaShoah, and its message, comes as Jewish communities are still reeling from the events of October 7, 2023. Hamas' brutal terrorist attacks against Israel were the deadliest attacks on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Canada unequivocally condemns the attacks and anyone who glorifies Hamas' indefensible actions. Hamas are not freedom fighters; they are not a resistance; they are terrorists.\n\n\"Since October 7, Jewish communities in Canada and around the world have experienced a disturbing rise in antisemitism. That is unacceptable and must not continue. Whether it's at a synagogue or a Jewish business or school; whether it's wearing the Star of David or a Kippah - Jewish Canadians deserve to feel safe, supported, and welcomed. They deserve to live openly and proudly Jewish lives, without intimidation or fear.\n\n\"To Jewish Canadians, know that we stand with you. Our solidarity is steadfast. And our commitment to your safety is ironclad. We will continue to take action to keep you safe and raise awareness about antisemitism. Budget 2024 announced the creation of a new permanent national Holocaust remembrance program, with a $5 million investment. This will support initiatives to preserve the memory of the Holocaust and help more Canadians learn about the atrocities and the antisemitism that led to them. Budget 2024 also invests over $273 million over six years to implement Canada's Action Plan on Combatting Hate, including over $29 million ongoing to combat hate crimes and enhance community security. And we're renewing Canada's National Holocaust Monument, increasing its visibility and engagement so its lessons reach even more communities across the country.\n\n\"Today, and everyday, we honour and celebrate the courage and resilience of Jewish Canadians and the Jewish people. As ceremonies are held in schools, synagogues, and community centres across the country, I encourage all Canadians to speak out against antisemitism and to pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust.\n\n\"Together, let us never forget and let us all repeat the vow: 'Never again'.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the Jews in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kippah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star of David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synagogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1225, "textEnd": 1234}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Ceasefire now!\"\n\nThousands of Jews, including Holocaust survivors affected by the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, walked through the former Auschwitz death camp on Monday for the annual March of the Living.\n\nWalking along the 1.8 mile path towards the crematoria of Birkenau, they paid tribute to the millions of Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War Two.\n\nThis year's ceremony was overshadowed by last year's events when 1,200 people were killed in a Hamas-led rampage through Israeli towns and 253 hostages taken by terrorists.\n\nDaniel Louz, 90, saw his hometown Kibbutz Beeri lose a tenth of its residents to the terror group last year.\n\nHe now came to the Auschwitz camp for the first time since his mother's family was killed there in 1942.\n\nLouz said: \"I am convinced that on October 7 in Beeri the good souls (of the Holocaust dead) protected me and did not let the Hamas criminals shoot at our home.\n\n\"So that I might be able to tell the story. I am really thankful to you all.\"\n\nMore than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, perished in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease at Auschwitz, which Germans set up in occupied Poland during the Second World War.\n\nMore than three million of Poland's 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust.\n\nPhyllis Greenberg Heideman, president of the International March of the Living, said during Monday's event: \"Prior to October 7 it is my belief ... that the worst event in human history happened on these grounds.\n\n\"That this place, the very word Auschwitz, speaks volumes in one word about fear, death, destruction, annihilation.\n\n\"And then came October 7, and perhaps we have to come as a people to the realisation that perhaps in some ways the Shoah (Holocaust) isn't over for us.\n\n\"It's not a competition, certainly not a comparison, it's a continuum.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) are continuing to gear up for their immense six-week assault on Rafah to once and for all eliminate any remaining Hamas terrorists in a final battle.\n\nIsrael warned that residents still trapped in the Gazan city will be used as \"human shields\" by Hamas thugs if they don't evacuate the war-torn city immediately.\n\nIsrael's defence minister warned on Sunday that an invasion of refugee-filled Rafah is imminent after a ceasefire deal crumbled due to Hamas' demands.\n\nBodies have already been piling up on the streets of Rafah as reports of dogs feasting on the corpses have started to emerge as the city awaits an almighty siege.\n\nYoav Gallant warned his government was preparing to launch \"a powerful operation in the very near future in Rafah and other places across all of Gaza\".\n\nSome 1.5million civilians are sheltering in Rafah, with most having fled from cities, refugee camps, and villages further north.\n\nLess than half of the 250 hostages snatched by militants on October 7 have been released in the seven months since Hamas launched its assault on Israel, though many are believed to have died in captivity.\n\nThe United Nations have warned any assault on Rafah could spark a bloodbath for helpless civilians.\n\nNations including the UK and the US are also pushing to avert a Rafah offensive.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType":

The annual ceremony is timed to coincide with Israel's Holocaust memorial day.\n\nIsrael's Holocaust commemorations this year have a searing significance for six elderly survivors now deeply scarred by the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 that sparked the ongoing Gaza war.\n\nThe killing and kidnapping spree by Palestinian infiltrators on a Jewish holiday morning shook the sense of security of Israelis - not least, those who had witnessed the state emerge as a safe haven after the Nazi genocide. For Bellha Haim, 86, the upheaval is especially profound.\n\nHer grandson Yotam - like her, a resident of a village near the Gaza border - was taken hostage by Hamas and managed to escape, only to be accidentally shot dead by Israeli soldiers. The trauma drove Haim to return to her native Poland, which she had fled with her family as a child during World War Two, and where she will on Monday take part of the \"March of the Living\" at the site of the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nThe annual ceremony is timed to coincide with Israel's Holocaust memorial day. \"I never went back, and I wasn't convinced to go back,\" she said during a meeting with other survivors ahead of the trip.\n\n\"But this time, when they told me that they were connecting the Holocaust and what I call the 'Holocaust of October 7' - because then in the Holocaust we (Jews) were not a united people, we didn't have a country, and suddenly this pride of mine that has been broken, my pride in my people and my country that was shattered in front of my eyes - I said, 'This time I will break my oath and I will go out.'\" As a teenager, Yotam had taken part in the annual Auschwitz vigil and Haim said she saw the event as a chance for communion with him and other victims of the Hamas attack.\n\n\"I will go out in the name of Yotam, who marched there when he was in high school, and I will go out there to shout out the cry of the slain, of the babies, of all my good friends that I will never meet again,\" she said. ARABIC YELLING AND GUNFIRE\n\nAmong those joining her will be 90-year-old Daniel Louz, whose hometown Kibbutz Beeri lost a tenth of its residents to the Palestinian attackers. In some ways, he said, that ordeal was worse for him than the European war, when he escaped Nazi round-ups in his native France although half his family perished in Poland.\n\nAfter he awoke to the sound of Arabic yelling and gunfire, \"I was constantly busy with surviving and figuring out what to do,\" Louz said. \"In France, as a child, I suffered all kinds of post-traumas that I've learned to cope with. But in Beeri, it was the first time that I felt the fear of death.\" A neighbouring house was riddled with bullets. Louz's was untouched. He says he imagined the souls of the six million Holocaust victims steering Hamas away from him. \"They probably wanted me to be here to tell this story,\" he said, weeping.\n\nOther Holocaust survivors participating in the March of the Living include Smil Bercu Sacagiu, 87, whose home was hit by a rocket from Gaza, and Jacqueline Gliksman, 81, whose home was torched by a Palestinian infiltrator. \"What was left, and luckily the terrorist didn't see it, is my grandchildren,\" she said, referring to gold figurines on a necklace she was wearing. \"That's the only thing I have left.\"\n\nBefore he was seized, Haim's grandson left a text message: \"They're burning down my house. I smell gas. I'm scared.\" She said that reminded her of a Holocaust-era song in Yiddish, invoking centuries of pogroms, with the refrain \"fire, Jews, fire\". A veteran campaigner for peace with the Palestinians, Haim said she would no longer pursue that activism.\n\n\"I'm not able to,\" she said. \"Now what interests me is only my people.\" (Writing by Dan Williams; editing by Barbara Lewis)\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auschwitz concentration camp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "March of the Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_holidays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish holidays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eucharist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yiddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust victims"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kibbutz"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pogrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/01_04_2019_19_29_06_9517358.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9535830", "eventUri": "eng-9535830", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 452, "textEnd": 458, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

This initiative underscores the power of sports in bridging communities and commemorating historical events.\n\nMembers of the delegation, consisting of officials from clubs across the first and second divisions of German football, took part in the official Yom Hashoah ceremony held at Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, marking a significant moment of reflection and commemoration. The group also took part in a workshop at Yad Vashem the next day, aimed at deepening understanding of the Holocaust and highlighting the responsibilities of sports organizations in promoting tolerance and remembrance.\n\nUpon arriving in Israel on Saturday the group met with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Tel Aviv and attended the evening rally in Hostages Square.\n\nTrip participants also visited Kibbutz Kfar Aza in southern Israel, an area profoundly affected by the events of October 7th. The group was hosted by the family of Netta Epstein, a beloved member of the local Kfar Aza Foxes soccer team who was killed along with more than 1,000 civilians during Hamas's attack.\n\nOrganized by the WJC in collaboration with the DFL, this visit exemplifies the joint efforts of the global sports community to combat antisemitism and foster a culture of remembrance and education. Through this visit, the delegation aims to inspire action and promote the message of tolerance and understanding across the sports world and beyond.\n\n\"We are honored to lead this delegation to Israel on such a significant occasion,\" said WJC Executive Vice President Maram Stern. \"By standing together in remembrance and solidarity, we reaffirm the role of sports as a catalyst for change and a beacon of hope.\"\n\n\"We're very honored, and excited by the opportunity to commemorate Yom Hashoah at Yad Vashem. As the representative of German professional football clubs we recognize the power that sport has to promote remembrance and draw attention to the plight of those who suffered in the Holocaust. The Footballing community should stand together as a family against hate - this message is timeless, and important especially in these difficult times\", said Tobias Kaufmann, Senior Vice President Communications of the German Football League.\n\n\"This year's Holocaust Remembrance Day is particularly poignant in the face of rising global antisemitism,\" Yad Vashem Chairman Dani Dayan remarked. \"The central theme for this year's Yom Hashoah, 'A Lost World: The Destruction of the Jewish Communities,' emphasizes the communities lost to the Holocaust. Recent events underscore the paramount importance of remembrance. With the participation of members from the German Football League and the World Jewish Congress, we honor and remember the six million Jewish victims and reaffirm our commitment to combatting antisemitism and fostering tolerance.\"\n\nThe World Jewish Congress previously announced the launch of two additional sport-related initiatives set to coincide with the UEFA EURO 2024 tournament in Germany:\n\nThe initiative \"Football and Memory\" launched on 25 April, connects UEFA EURO 2024 attendees with the history of the Holocaust through visits to local memorials and former concentration camps. Developed in partnership with the German Football Association's (DFB) Cultural Foundation, \"Football and Memory\" reflects on history by using sport as a bridge to the past. Special programming at each site will highlight the interconnectedness of sports, history and memory. A website, available before and during the tournament, will also link visitors to host cities where memorials and museums are located.\n\nStarting May 23 and continuing through July, the World Jewish Congress will host a dynamic public exhibit, \"Sports. Crowds. Power.\" at the Sports Museum on the grounds of the 1936 Summer Olympics, when the Nazis were in power. The site is adjacent to Berlin's Olympic Stadium which will host the finals of this summer's tournament.\n\n\"Sports. Crowds. Power.\" explores the nefarious role of sports under National Socialism and delves into how the Nazis manipulated sports to consolidate power, the tragic impact of the Holocaust on European Jewish athletes and sporting clubs, and the contemporary role of sports in combating antisemitism.\n\nFor more information about the visit and the initiatives of the World Jewish Congress and the German

He was forced to hide out and conceal his family identity -- and lost nearly every family member during Adolf Hitler's reign.\n\nListen to them on the latest episode of \"Quick Start\"\n\nWurfl, who shared his harrowing story in the book \"My Two Lives,\" told CBN News he never thought he'd see such rampant antisemitism in America, where he settled in the years after the Holocaust.\n\n\"It's frightening, because it could end up in the same sort of situation eventually,\" Wurfl said of spiraling antisemitism that many have compared to the situation before Hitler launched his murderous quest. \"I just don't understand it. How people can feel like this again -- that they don't know what happened during the Holocaust, back during Hitler's regime?\"\n\nThe survivor lamented the loss of millions of lives and expressed his severe sorrow and fear over where the situation currently stands after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack and the antisemitism that followed.\n\n\"One would think that, once this happened, it could never happen again -- that people have learned from this,\" Wurfl said. \"But I'm beginning to wonder, because the younger people nowadays don't know anything about the Holocaust.\"\n\nWatch Wurfl explain:\n\nWurfl's comments came after a recent YouGov and Economist poll of 1,500 18-29-year-olds yielded some shocking findings. A whopping 20% believed the Holocaust never happened -- and an additional 30% were unsure, underscoring fears of antisemitism among youths.\n\nAnother recent poll from Summit.org and RMG Research found that 33% of 18-24-year-old voters believe \"Israel does not have a right to exist as a nation in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"It's frightening,\" Wurfl said of the current dynamic among young people who continue to occupy college campuses with anti-Israel fervor. \"And I can't understand that our education hasn't been better to let the kids know what happened [during the Holocaust].\"\n\nAs CBN News has documented, Wurfl's own journey during the Holocaust was quite painful.\n\n\"I lost my entire family,\" he said. \"I lost my father, who had become a political prisoner ... and my mother was arrested by the Gestapo and the SS, and she was taken to Auschwitz, and she was killed there.\"\n\nWurfl continued, \"And then all my grandparents, my uncles, my aunts, my nephews, everybody in my family eventually was killed during that period of time, so that the only people who survived the war in that period of time was my brother, Peter, and myself.\"\n\nAs for Israel's decision to decisively fight back after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Wurfl said the Jewish state \"had no choice.\"\n\n\"Right now, we have these things going on in the colleges ... the Jews never started a war,\" he said. \"Here, again, Hamas is the one who started it. What were the Jews supposed to do?

This year has an unusually high attendance because it's the 80th anniversary of the Holocaust in Hungary, in which the Nazis and their collaborators murdered more than 400,000 people within eight weeks.\n\nK\u00f6ves, 89, attends the march \"to show I am still alive, I am still here,\" he tells The Times of Israel at the event, which is occurring just before the beginning of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day this evening.

His father had been taken to a forced labor camp and the family reunited after the Soviet army liberated Hungary. But his mother was raped by one or more Russian soldiers, he says.\n\n\"After all that has happened, the terrible drama, you see, perhaps, why it is important for me to show a presence,\" says K\u00f6ves, who has two children with his Catholic wife.

The recent events unfolding at Columbia University which spread to other universities throughout the United States have sparked great concern and alarm. The support for terror activities targeting Jews and Americans is not only shocking but also deeply troubling. The physical and verbal abuse against students, especially Jews, the burning of U.S. and Israeli flags, bring back painful memories of the atrocities of the Holocaust and the Third Reich..\n\nWatching professors on campus openly calling for violence and terrorism against Jews and Americans, including chants of \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to America\" is beyond belief. These groups are promoting messages of hate and violence, threatening the safety of Jewish and American students not only on campus but also around the globe. The language being used is not only deeply offensive but also incites fear of harm especially in the Jewish community. Calling for violence and a repeat of October 7th, reminds us of how important Holocaust Memorial Day is for the next generation to see what hate can lead to.\n\nWhile we remember those fwho perished in the Holocaust today, it's saddening to see how universities throughout the United States are turning out students as uneducated as peasants of the past. They are not teaching about the past, nstead professors are rallying hate, Anti Semitism and Anti American ideology promoting a culture of terror, hate and ignorance instead of encouraging learning what hate can lead to from the Holocaust .\n\nAmerican Jews being are threatened and discriminated against openly today without the authorities investigating perpetrator's activities as hate and terror crimes is deeply concerning.\n\nIt's totally unbelievable to see how America's Universities in the 21st century became a home to students who are being paid a stipend to join university protests supporting terror without actually knowing what they are demonstrating for and who they are supporting.\n\nAnother alarming concern is the fact that students are not being taught the past with many of them oblivious of the mass murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust, a situationwhich speaks volumes about the failure of these institutions. As Dani Dayan, Chairman of Yad Vashem Chairman said as he addressed Yad Vashem: From Auschwitz and Berlin to Be'eri to Columbia University the world continues to forget.\n\nWe have the privilege of being able to access information from various sources today. It takes minutes to learn how Hamas is a barbaric terrorist group calling for the destruction of America, Jews and the west, yet many individuals seem to be blindly following their narrative of hate and anti-Semitism.\n\nWitness how Ivy League universities are failing to educate their students about the Holocaust, instead choosing to promote a one-sided narrative of anti semitism and self inflicted hate. Could it be that these institutions, funded heavily by Arab extremist nations, have their own anti-Semitic, anti American agendas, and are willing to sacrifice the education of their students and promote anti American Ideology in order to further their own hateful interests?\n\nThe recent trend of individuals proclaiming support for Hamas who promised to extinguish the jewish nation in the same Holocaust style mass murder of Jews which they performed on October 7th is alarming. From students chanting anti-Israel and Anti American slogans, burning American Flags on campuses, to individuals donning keffiyehs without comprehending the significance behind that act, it is clear that there is no Holocaust education on campuses and the hate being promoted on campus must be stopped before it's too late.\n\nAnother deeply concerning sight is witnessing professors going to great lengths to cover up blatant anti-Semitism by attributing it to psychological factors, such as the inner anger of students being locked up during Covid-19 that drives them to come out en masse.\n\nThe use of masks as a shield to conceal identity while spewing hate speech is a cowardly tactic, and the fact that professors are using this as an excuse to defend such despicable actions as an excuse to cover up that it is bluntly coming from anti Semitism is truly alarming. By attributing these actions to pandemic-related anger, these educators are not only enabling anti-Semitic behavior but also perpetuating harmful stereotypes and covering up educating a next generation of homebound terrorists in our own Universities and college campuses with American taxpayer dollars.\n\nAs Jews, we feel a deep sense of fear and unease reminiscent of Kristallnacht here in New York City and we must demand all our institutions use Holocaust Memorial Day to teach their students what NEVER AGAIN STANDS FOR!.", "source": {"uri": "israelnationalnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Her family later moved to Philadelphia in 1952.\n\nBrandspiegel sat in the front row next to Elizabeth Zuckerman Bleiman, 102. She had been sent with her father and stepmother to the Kisvarda ghetto in Hungary where she became a nurse. She was later put on a train to Auschwitz, and then sent to a labor camp before it was liberated.\n\nAt Sunday's event, State Sen. Sharif Street quoted a West African saying that he said is appropriate today: \"In order for us to move forward, we must look back.\"\n\n\"We must remember that before there were gas chambers, before people were rounded up, there were pamphlets and rhetoric that spread rumors and lies in antisemitic tropes,\" he said. \"There were elections and there was political organizing when people began to scapegoat the Jewish people. We must remember that the Holocaust didn't just occur at the end when people were all rounded up and the atrocities that we talked most about occurred. We must remember that it was a gradual increase in rhetoric. There was a dehumanizing effect ... that they were \"The Other.'\n\n\" READ MORE: Student protests over Gaza war are forcing Penn and other U.S. universities to face 'impossible' demands\n\n\"The rights didn't just topple down all at once, but that they were withered away at over time,\" he said.\n\nToday, he said he sees a rise in antisemitism. \"We must understand that we are seeing many of the early signs that led to the Holocaust. We are seeing the kinds of things and we must remember that it did not have to happen.\"\n\nPeople have to speak up when they hear hatred, he said. \"Not just Jewish people, but all people who know it is wrong ... If we really believe never again, you must never again be silent.\"\n\nMichael Markman, board chair of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, said, \"For the past 60 years our community has shown up each year to say never again, to ensure that you never forget about those who perished.\"\n\nBut these past seven months, he said, \"have been tremendously challenging. Since October 7, we've seen an unprecedented spike in antisemitism locally and worldwide. This is starting to feel like 1933 Germany and if we sit and we do not fight, it will happen again and we cannot allow that.\"\n\n\"Prior to Israel invading Gaza, these demonstrators hit our campuses, attacked our children and attacked us for being born Jews. This cannot happen. We must all fight together. Bigotry and racism cannot continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barbara_laker@inquirer.com", "name": "Barbara

This narrative has become much less widespread since the first few decades of Israel's founding.\n\n\"The narrative we learned in our schools was 'sheep to the slaughter' and there are plenty of reasons why that narrative took root among us, but the truth is that the Jews did not go like sheep to the slaughter,\" said Katz.\n\n\"Up against a destruction machine unlike anything the world had seen, they fought fiercely not just to save themselves, but to save their brothers and sisters, many times risking their lives and sometimes paying the price with their lives,\" he continued.\n\nMost of those honored in Monday's event resisted the Nazis quietly, saving the lives of thousands of Jews by arranging hiding places and helping others avoid deportation to detention and death camps.\n\nAmong those honored were Georges and Elise Garel, a French-Jewish couple who established the \"Garel Network,\" an underground arm of the humanitarian organization the Children's Aid Society, which arranged hiding places for children in France and saved some 1,600 lives.\n\nSome of the rescuers saved numerous lives outside of organizational frameworks, like the Tunisian Jewish boxer Victor Perez, who was arrested by collaborationist forces in Nazi-occupied France.\n\nWhile in Auschwitz, Perez snuck out pots of soup from the kitchen where he worked, and distributed them to starving prisoners. He was later murdered by a Nazi guard, after being sent on a death march with other prisoners to the Gleiwitz concentration camp.\n\nLooming over each family member that went up to receive their citation was Nathan Rapaport's \"Scroll of Fire\" monument, depicting the horror of the Holocaust and prophetic and redemptive imagery tied to Israeli independence which soon followed.\n\nThe ceremony, with the customary lowering of the Israeli flag to half-staff, followed by a 10 a.m. siren to mark a moment of silence, bringing the audience, and much of the country, to a halt.\n\nFor the diplomats, organization chairmen and Border Police brass that delivered speeches ahead of the certificate-giving ceremony, the Hamas massacres of October 7 were impossible to sidestep, and many invited comparisons between the two tragedies.\n\n\"Raising our voices to say never again is more necessary today than ever,\" continued Barbanti. \"The ferocious antisemitic massacre of October 7 represented the darkest page for the people of Israel since its foundation.\"\n\nKatz said that October 7 \"revealed to us hundreds of new heroes, people we didn't know of, who fought fiercely against evil to bring an end to the cruelty that was revealed,\" and added that there are likely still many stories from Simhat Torah that are waiting to be told.\n\nBrig. Gen. Jihad Hasan, who trains soldiers in the Border Patrol, invoked the recent Passover holiday in his assertion that Israel deals with existential threats in \"every generation, in every period.\"\n\n\"The intention of our enemies has not changed, but our ability has. Our enemies stand up against strong and firm security forces that defends its civilians' lives, security and the State of Israel at any cost,\" he said.\n\nBy the end of the ceremony, rain had begun to pour heavily on the crowd as a youth acapella group led them in Hatikvah, Israel's national anthem.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"},

But few events have left me fearing a return of the horrors of the Holocaust as those we are facing today. With the situation between Israel and its neighbors only worsening since Oct. 7, the growing isolation of the Jewish state and anti-semitic sentiment and violence flaring everywhere, I worry now more than ever about threats to the Jewish community worldwide.\n\nAs a novelist, I would have hoped to see the entertainment and literary world continuing to bring stories that keep the memories of the Holocaust and the need to prevent history from repeating itself alive. Narrative works, as brought to life by movies, plays, novels and memoirs, continually breathe new life into the events of the past, making them relatable through characters and their personal journeys. Who could ever forget the plight of Anne Frank, whose diary-memoir continues to inform and enlighten people everywhere three quarters of a century after it was written? \"The Book Thief,\" \"The Boy in Striped Pajamas,\" \"Sophie's Choice\" -- all have touched countless hearts and fanned the flames of determination to make sure the real-life events behind these stories, as like their implications, never die.\n\nYet, new stories about the Holocaust are increasingly rare. A quick look at the publication dates of the books mentioned above speaks volumes: \"The Boy in Striped Pajamas,\" 2008 -- the same year as the film. \"The Book Thief,\" 2005. \"Sophie's Choice,\" 1992. The numbers of forthcoming titles about the Holocaust are painfully low. Just three are listed in a January Publisher's Weekly list combining new books about the Holocaust, World War II and wartime leadership. An Amazon search turns up only two fairly recent novels or memoirs set in, or spotlighting aspects of, one of history's darkest times.\n\nWeaving Holocaust events into other genres such as mysteries and thrillers also seems to have fallen out of style. In fact, the Holocaust itself seems to be losing its appeal as a source for storytelling, particularly in the publishing world.\n\nThat's certainly not for a lack of stories to tell. Even as time marches on, survivors and their descendants each have unique personal experiences to share. The repercussions continue to reverberate across generations, giving rise to new stories to tell. I for one grew up alongside aunts and uncles who survived the horrors of the camps. In the 1950s, fresh in the wake of the War's end, I visited the liberated camps. The memories of the gas chambers and survivors speaking about the hell they went through remain painfully vivid in my mind to this day. These events inspired some of my own novels, including \"The Aleph Bet Conspiracy\" and \"Four Women,\" but there's still so much more to say. In fact, the possibilities for telling new stories about these past events are endless. And they always will be.\n\nThat's why, in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, I call upon the publishing industry in particular to look beyond current trends and revive the focus on Holocaust stories for these reasons:\n\nStories about the Holocaust must never not be viewed as \"out of style.\"\n\nRegardless of new and emerging societal trends, the historic tragedy of the Holocaust is timeless. We must resist the temptation to file it away as no longer relevant, even as new events arise. Honoring its timelessness as a source for storytelling is essential to the\n\nThere are as many stories to tell as ever before.\n\nThere are still survivors living around the world. Survivors not just of the camps, but of deportations, of hiding, of hunger, of death threats and discrimination. Each unique story deserves to be heard.\n\nSurvivors descendants have -- and will always have -- new stories to tell\n\nThe generational repercussions, including trauma, will never end. As time goes on, the impact on individuals and families continues to evolve, creating new stories that must also be shared.\n\nStorytelling is the most powerful way to prevent history from repeating itself\n\nWhile historic and analytical works play an important role, their audiences are limited. Narrative- and character-driven stories are infinitely more accessible and relatable to vast numbers of people. Through storytelling, the implications and lessons of history stick in minds and hearts.\n\nMy own gesture in support of this call to action has been to re-publish, this year, my novels highlighting the Holocaust. I look to the publishing industry to introduce new Holocaust-based titles that will inspire a drive to prevent a repeat of history for years to come.\n\nNorman Shabel is the author of eight novels, praised by Judge Andrew P.

Born in 1939 in Kyiv, Mira was just one of the hundreds of thousands of Jews trying to escape the city before the Nazis arrived.\n\nUnable to leave, Mira and her mother were forced into the ghetto. And it was there, in the Kyiv Ghetto, where a miracle happened. A Ukrainian guard unexpectedly befriended them. One evening, he came to Mira's mother and told her she needed to leave the city immediately. The Germans were coming and they intended to evacuate the ghetto. That meant only one thing -- they were going to kill all the Jews.\n\nThe guard gave the family some food and opened the gate for Mira and her mother to escape. Mira recalls, \"If he hadn't done that, my mother and I wouldn't have remained alive. The next day, all the Jews were marched in a procession to Babi Yar in the suburbs of Kyiv and murdered. Approximately 150,000 Jews were murdered in that terrible place. My childhood was taken from me, but at least I survived. I think we survived thanks to our faith in God.\"\n\nIt is that sustaining faith that not only kept Mira and her family alive during the Holocaust, but also brought her to her biblical homeland, where she has lived in Ashkelon in southern Israel.\n\nIt is that sustaining faith that kept the 85-year-old alive even after her house was hit by a missile fired from Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, completely destroying her home.\n\nAnd it is that sustaining faith that has been at the core of the miraculous Jewish survival and resiliency throughout our history.\n\nFrom sundown on May 5 through sundown on May 6, the nation of Israel and Jews worldwide will observe Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, remembering the six million Jewish men, women, and children who were brutally murdered at the hands of the Nazi regime. During the observance, air raid sirens will sound throughout Israel at 10 a.m. and the entire country will come to a halt -- no matter where we are -- as together, we remember those who were lost during the Holocaust simply for being Jewish.\n\nAs the siren blares, I will be thinking about my grandfather's family, who were burned in Auschwitz. I will be remembering my father-in-law's grandparents, aunts, and uncles, who were murdered by the Nazis. Nearly every Jewish person in Israel isn't just memorializing the Holocaust as a tragedy read about in history books; they're memorializing family members and loved ones. For us, it's personal.\n\nThis year on Yom HaShoah, Jews and non-Jews alike will remember the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust, because in a terrifying way we are seeing stark reminders of what happens when the world forgets. As people of faith who value life and freedom, this year, more than ever, we will renew our vow of 'never again!\" Not on our watch.\n\nNever again will we let untethered hate destroy us. We will finally learn from the darkness of history, we will do everything to protect the sanctity of life, and we will proclaim, as the psalmist did thousands of years ago, \"I will not die but live, and will proclaim what the LORD has done\" (Psalm 118:17).\n\nDuring Yom HaShoah, we can't forget that more than a hundred of our Israeli husbands, wives, daughters, friends, and family remain hostages somewhere in Gaza. They were kidnapped and are being tortured simply for being Jewish.\n\nOn October 7, more than 1,200 innocent Israelis were brutally murdered, some as they slept in their beds, or danced at a party. They too, were murdered for the 'crime' of being Jewish.\n\nFor many years after the Holocaust, terrorists who wanted to kill the Jewish people and vowed to wipe Israel off the map were condemned by nearly everyone in the Western world. But now, less than 85 years since the Holocaust, it's become an accepted position - on college campuses, in government bodies, in mainstream media, and on the streets of liberal, democratic countries - to call for policies that would wipe the Jewish state and the Jewish people from the face of the earth.\n\nMillions of people in America, Europe, Australia, and throughout the West have openly turned their backs on Israel and the Jewish people, and that dangerous trend is growing by the day. Anti-Semitism is on the rise, to the point that what is happening today on college campuses in the U.S. - some of which are enforcing 'no Zionist' zones, with barely any voices raised in opposition - resembles what happened on college campuses in 1930s-era Germany.\n\nThe free world used to understand that a secure and protected Jewish state was necessary. Now, that consensus has been shattered. This means that, once again, the Jewish people's survival is at risk.\n\nIn the face of such darkness and evil, however, there is great hope. When I listen to Mira's story, I am both encouraged and inspired by her faith, and by the faith of the millions of non-Jews around the world who responded in prayer and action to bring Mira the immediate aid she needed.\n\n\"On the morning of Oct. 8, I went into the bathroom when I heard the sirens go off because I do not have a shelter to go to,\" Mira said. \"I stayed in the bathroom and then suddenly a huge explosion hit the house... I felt tremendous heat on my face from the explosion and I must have passed out.\"\n\nWhen Mira came to, she was covered in blood. She started screaming, hoping someone would hear her from the ruins. One of her neighbors found her and pulled her from the wreckage of her home. She was wounded in the face and suffered burns from the fire that broke out from the explosion. Since that day, she has undergone numerous medical and cosmetic surgeries, but Mira's spirit and faith remain strong.\n\n\"I was left with nothing and I have to start all over again,\" Mira said, now living in a rental apartment supplied by the government of Israel.\n\nIt's especially hard to start over at her age, which is why the organization I head, the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, has been with her every step of the way. We've provided Mira with financial assistance and ongoing support so that she has been able to get back on her feet.\n\n\"As a woman of faith, I am moved to hear that there are many Christians in the United States who care for me and help the elderly in Israel. Your visit and attention make me feel better and optimistic,\" Mira said.\n\nThroughout Israel, Holocaust survivors just like Mira are once again facing an evil that threatens their very existence ... and the existence of their people. They see Hamas terrorists carrying out unspeakably brutal terror attacks against Jews on a scale once thought impossible. They see Iran and its proxies publicly calling for Israel's destruction. They see anti-Semitism growing around the world.\n\nThe Jewish people are strong. We are resilient, and we are more determined than ever to survive and to live -- and to ensure the state of Israel lives, too. And, thankfully, today, as Mira pointed out, we have hundreds of millions of Christian friends around the world who boldly, vocally, and unapologetically stand with us.\n\nWith this in mind, friends, the most significant step you can take this year, as we observe Yom HaShoah, is to stand with Israel. More than ever, the people of Israel need you to stand with and support survivors like Mira, with your prayers and your actions.\n\nFor generations, Christians have learned about and admired Corrie Ten Boom - the Christian hero who, at the risk of her own life, saved numerous Jewish lives during the Holocaust. Now is the time when every person of faith is being called to their 'Corrie Ten Boom' moment; to go against the anti-Semitic trends, and boldly stand with Israel.\n\nFaith and action is what has sustained the Jewish people through centuries of persecution, inquisitions, pogroms, and even the Holocaust. And it is faith with action that will sustain us -- Christians and Jews - today.", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network"}, "authors":

Some I was not. All of them were families and children. This room is my pause and this light must not go out.\"\n\nAt the outset of the Second World War, Gropper's parents fled Poland, escaping Nazi persecution, only to be arrested by the Soviet Union army and sent to a slave labour camp in the Ural Mountains.\n\n\"I was born in a coal mine in Siberia,\" said Gropper. \"And my mother was assured that there wasn't the remotest possibility that I would survive. She was determined to prove that a less than two-pound baby could survive.\"\n\nThe conditions were horrific, and many did not survive the mines.\n\nHer family did, however, and came to Canada after the war.\n\n\"This country means a tremendous amount to me as I remember where we came from, and as I memorialize, never to forget, I am caught in today's news, and I can't help but feel upset, concerned,\" she said.\n\nSince Oct. 7, Montreal police (SPVM) have reported 154 hate crimes and 55 incidents directed at the Jewish community.\n\nAt McGill University, the pro-Palestinian encampment has been peaceful for the most part, but earlier this week, video footage emerged of some demonstrators telling Jewish students to \"go back to Europe.\"\n\nFor Holocaust Museum president Jacques Saada, the slogan shows a lack of understanding and compassion.\n\n\"There is a difference between a noble cause, which is the Palestinian cause and what's happening and this statement that we hear,\" said Saada. \"The Shoah is not a theory. It's not something which we talk about in a vacuum. It is 6 million people who lost their lives, and it's not the statistics and the statistics only. It is real people with real hopes, real aspirations, real pains. It was people like. Like you and me. And these people have been eliminated just because they were Jewish.\"\n\nNow in her 80s, Gropper devotes much of her time to telling her family's story, fostering understanding through her work at the Holocaust Museum.\n\n\"I want us to be able to live together,\" she said. \"I am not interested in hate and my only tools as a as an educator of a lifetime.

But few events have left me fearing a return of the horrors of the Holocaust as those we are facing today. With the situation between Israel and its neighbors only worsening since Oct. 7, the growing isolation of the Jewish state and anti-semitic sentiment and violence flaring everywhere, I worry now more than ever about threats to the Jewish community worldwide.\n\nAs a novelist, I would have hoped to see the entertainment and literary world continuing to bring stories that keep the memories of the Holocaust and the need to prevent history from repeating itself alive. Narrative works, as brought to life by movies, plays, novels and memoirs, continually breathe new life into the events of the past, making them relatable through characters and their personal journeys. Who could ever forget the plight of Anne Frank, whose diary-memoir continues to inform and enlighten people everywhere three quarters of a century after it was written? \"The Book Thief,\" \"The Boy in Striped Pajamas,\" \"Sophie's Choice\" -- all have touched countless hearts and fanned the flames of determination to make sure the real-life events behind these stories, as like their implications, never die.\n\nYet, new stories about the Holocaust are increasingly rare. A quick look at the publication dates of the books mentioned above speaks volumes: \"The Boy in Striped Pajamas,\" 2008 -- the same year as the film. \"The Book Thief,\" 2005. \"Sophie's Choice,\" 1992. The numbers of forthcoming titles about the Holocaust are painfully low. Just three are listed in a January Publisher's Weekly list combining new books about the Holocaust, World War II and wartime leadership. An Amazon search turns up only two fairly recent novels or memoirs set in, or spotlighting aspects of, one of history's darkest times.\n\nWeaving Holocaust events into other genres such as mysteries and thrillers also seems to have fallen out of style. In fact, the Holocaust itself seems to be losing its appeal as a source for storytelling, particularly in the publishing world.\n\nThat's certainly not for a lack of stories to tell. Even as time marches on, survivors and their descendants each have unique personal experiences to share. The repercussions continue to reverberate across generations, giving rise to new stories to tell. I for one grew up alongside aunts and uncles who survived the horrors of the camps. In the 1950s, fresh in the wake of the War's end, I visited the liberated camps. The memories of the gas chambers and survivors speaking about the hell they went through remain painfully vivid in my mind to this day. These events inspired some of my own novels, including \"The Aleph Bet Conspiracy\" and \"Four Women,\" but there's still so much more to say. In fact, the possibilities for telling new stories about these past events are endless. And they always will be.\n\nThat's why, in honor of Holocaust Remembrance Day, I call upon the publishing industry in particular to look beyond current trends and revive the focus on Holocaust stories for these reasons:\n\nStories about the Holocaust must never not be viewed as \"out of style.\"\n\nRegardless of new and emerging societal trends, the historic tragedy of the Holocaust is timeless. We must resist the temptation to file it away as no longer relevant, even as new events arise. Honoring its timelessness as a source for storytelling is essential to the\n\nThere are as many stories to tell as ever before.\n\nThere are still survivors living around the world. Survivors not just of the camps, but of deportations, of hiding, of hunger, of death threats and discrimination. Each unique story deserves to be heard.\n\nSurvivors descendants have -- and will always have -- new stories to tell\n\nThe generational repercussions, including trauma, will never end. As time goes on, the impact on individuals and families continues to evolve, creating new stories that must also be shared.\n\nStorytelling is the most powerful way to prevent history from repeating itself\n\nWhile historic and analytical works play an important role, their audiences are limited. Narrative- and character-driven stories are infinitely more accessible and relatable to vast numbers of people. Through storytelling, the implications and lessons of history stick in minds and hearts.\n\nMy own gesture in support of this call to action has been to re-publish, this year, my novels highlighting the Holocaust. I look to the publishing industry to introduce new Holocaust-based titles that will inspire a drive to prevent a repeat of history for years to come.\n\nNorman Shabel is the author of eight novels, praised by Judge Andrew P.

Following the onslaught, amid the ensuing war in Gaza, antisemitism incidents skyrocketed to record highs in the US and several other countries, especially in Europe.\n\nDoron Almog, chairman of the Jewish Agency, noted in a briefing with media from Israel that the scenes the Jewish state witnessed on Oct. 7 amounted to nothing less than a \"pogrom.\"\n\nOthers were more reluctant to draw direct comparisons.\n\nIsrael's President Isaac Herzog told the crowd in a video message: \"Although the Holocaust stands alone in the history of human crimes, we have been grieving deep tragedy over the past months. The sickness of blind hatred has been unleashed once again, in our own world and time.\"\n\nHershel Greenblat, an 83-year-old survivor from Atlanta, GA who accompanies students and highschoolers on the march, said he would not visit Auschwitz if it wasn't for a sense of duty to educate the next generation.\n\n\"I don't come to relive the past. The only reason I come is to be here with the students. To try to educate.\"\n\nGreenblat's parents -- from Poland and Ukraine, respectively -- were both in the resistance against the Nazis. The octogenarian found his grandmother, for whom he was named, listed in Auschwitz.\n\nBeyond survivors of the Holocaust and Oct. 7, several Arab and Muslim delegations from Israel and around the world also joined the march. Among them was a delegation organized by Sharaka (\"Partnership\" in Arabic), a nonprofit organization founded by leaders from Israel and the Gulf following the signing of the Abraham Accords, a series of historic peace agreements between Israel and Arab states brokered with the help of the United States.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"},

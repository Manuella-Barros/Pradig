Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, in Sudan in their fight with the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) headed by Gen. Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan.\n\nSudan has been undergoing political upheaval since the ouster of long-term leader Omar al-Bashir on 11 April 2019 by a coalition of SAF and RSF generals. The removal of Al-Bashir was precipitated by pro-democracy protests that gripped the country.\n\nProtests in Sudan were in large part driven by economic difficulties that forced the National Congress (NCP) regime to initiate economic reforms such as eliminating subsidies for basic items such as bread and fuel. These protests ultimately brought to the fore underlying issues such as democracy, marginalization, and human rights.\n\nThe West, led by the United States, embraced the pro-democracy groups and provided support for reforms in the country. But there was also a much more sinister motivation behind the involvement of the West. One was Bashir's government decision to give Russia a naval base in the Port Sudan region on the Red Sea.\n\nSudan is in an important Red Sea corridor that serves as a crucial access to the Indian Ocean. The Red Sea has always been a geostrategic access point as it serves the world's economy in the movement of goods between Europe and Asia. On 11 February 2023, it was reported by AP News that the Sudanese military leadership had reviewed the agreement and given it a green light subject to ratification by parliament. The agreement would allow Russia to establish a naval base in Port Sudan for 25 years and subject to automatic renewal for 10 years thereafter if there are no objections from either side. In return, Sudan would acquire weapons from Russia.\n\nTwo months later 15 April 2023, Sudan descended into conflagration when RSF pre-emptively launched attacks on SAF bases across the country over, among other things, differences in the timeframe to integrate RSF into SAF.\n\nThe conflict in Sudan has negatively impacted South Sudan in various ways. Atop the list is the displacement of millions of Sudanese and South Sudanese civilians from their homes in the North. South Sudan has opened its doors to hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees. In the eyes of South Sudanese, these are not merely refugees but genuine brothers and sisters who just happen to be across some imaginary line.\n\nThe conflict has also disrupted economic activities across the border and oil transit operations. South Sudan relies on Sudan to export its oil to the international market. Additionally, oil processing facilities are mostly located in Sudan. Some of the facilities have been damaged or are not functioning properly due to a lack of skilled technicians to do repairs and other maintenance work necessary for the proper functioning of the pipeline. This means that the last thing that South Sudan needs is a war in Sudan and supporting either side in the conflict would appear to be not in the best interest of South Sudan.\n\nHowever, South Sudan has been listed alongside Chad, Egypt, UEA, and recently Iran among others as countries involved in providing support to the belligerents in Sudan's conflict. The border area between Sudan and South Sudan is very fluid and ill-defined. Rebels are operating against South Sudan that have bases in Sudan. These rebels may take independent actions to support sides in the current Sudanese civil war in the hope that whichever side emerges victorious in Sudan will provide support to rebels hoping to topple the South Sudanese government. The evidence being used to accuse South Sudan of involvement in the Sudanese civil war may have come from NGOs operating in the border region of the Sudan-South Sudan divide. However, it is imperative to not rush such evidence to court as it is difficult to tell the elements of the South Sudan Defense Force (SSDF) from rebels. If you have an inexperienced NGO staff or UNMISS soldiers observing rebels acting in a manner that appears to support RSF or SAF and submit a report to their real controllers in the West, it could be taken as concrete evidence and used to sow discord between Sudan and South Sudan and thereby torpedo South Sudan's genuine attempts to bring warring parties to the peace table.\n\nTo disclose the elephant in the room, the real reason behind the allegations of South Sudan's involvement in the conflict is to choke South Sudan economically and thereby induce a regime change. With Sudan in flames, the flow of oil has declined dramatically, and facilities are damaged such that it could take years to return production to pre-war levels. The West has for some time now concluded that the Government of South Sudan is irretrievably corrupt and needs to be overhauled. They have also concluded that South Sudanese are incapable of changing their government through peaceful and democratic means.\n\nTherefore, a nudge from the West is necessary to make the populace feel the real pain in their daily lives and awaken them to the need for some kind of popular uprising or revolution that will appear to be owned by South Sudanese but is engineered to bring the country in line with West's regional designs.\n\nIn summary, the allegation of South Sudan's involvement in supporting either party to the war in Sudan is a pure myth designed to tarnish relations between Sudan and South Sudan. It is merely a ploy to hide the fact that Sudan's war will result in the decline of oil exports and revenues and therefore cause political upheaval in South Sudan that will result in favorable regime change.\n\nSouth Sudan has absolutely nothing to gain from supporting any party to the conflict in Sudan. South Sudan has its problems and adding to them by supporting continued fighting in Sudan would be myopic and a blunder of immense proportion. The best outcome for South Sudan is to see our sisterly country of Sudan return to peace.\n\nThe author is a South Sudanese and can be reached via jwerkok@gmail.com", "source": {"uri":

IOM will support the people and Governments of Sudan, South Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya and the Central African Republic in managing the mobility dimensions of crises, including the prevention of, and sustainable solutions to, displacement, and to assist affected migrants, returnees and host communities. IOM works across the nexus, applying a conflict sensitive lens to provide multisectoral humanitarian assistance to people in emergencies while simultaneously promoting disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness and resilience-building.\n\nContext analysis\n\nThe conflict that broke out on 15 April 2023 between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Force (SAF) continues to have devastating consequences for millions of civilians in Sudan, with 24.8 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance by December 2024 (Sudan HRP 2024).\n\nSudan has become the largest displacement crisis in the world. As of March 2024, IOM estimates that Sudan hosts more than 8.3 million internally displaced individuals, with 6.4 million having been recently displaced by the conflict, in addition to almost 1 million refugees who had been living in Sudan prior to the April 2023 conflict (IOM DTM, March 2024).\n\nA severe humanitarian crisis has also unfolded in neighbouring countries, which, as of March 2024, are hosting over 1.9 million people who fled Sudan in search of safety and access to goods and basic essential services. Of these, 63 per cent are Sudanese nationals and 37 per cent are of other nationalities (IOM DTM, March 2024). The majority of arrivals were reported in Chad (37%), South Sudan (31%) and Egypt (25%), and in areas that are often remote and underserved. If fighting continues, it is estimated that over 3.2 million refugees and migrants affected by the crisis in Sudan may require life-saving assistance across Sudan's neighbouring countries throughout 2024, a 50 per cent increase in the population in need projected for December 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the people in Sudan and those fleeing to neighbouring countries are facing a protection crisis, with women, girls, and vulnerable men and boys experiencing the worst consequences. Violations and needs such as family separation, alerts of trafficking, conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV) and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV), have put significant strains on existing weak protection structures with limited services available.\n\nThe complex humanitarian situation and the mixed nature of the movements out of Sudan call for a contextually relevant and needs-based response driven by strong coordination efforts within countries, regionally and internationally with relevant entities in countries of origin. It also calls for decentralization and localization of interventions underpinned by conflict sensitivity analysis to provide humanitarian assistance to those most in need, including in hard-to-reach areas. Continuing IOM's work in 2023, IOM's Crisis Response Plan (CRP) for the Sudan Crisis and Neighbouring Countries 2024 contributes to addressing the humanitarian needs inside Sudan and the complexities of a mixed movements response that is inclusive of the needs of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), migrant returnees, Third Country Nationals (TCNs), host communities, refugees and Government entities responding to the crisis.", "source": {"uri": "reliefweb.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReliefWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Migration", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Organization for Migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Libya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central African Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Central African Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/previews/b7/56/b7567574-3354-44c9-b6b8-e9d57ea09d8e.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543820", "eventUri": "eng-9543820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The country is expected to hold elections in December but key issues including a unified security force are yet to be resolved. The opposition has been calling for a speedy implementation of the agreement to pave the way for free and fair elections.\n\nKenyan President William Ruto gives an address during the launch of high-level peace talks for South Sudan at State House in Nairobi, Kenya, on Thursday, May 9, 2024.

It is gripped by multiple crises,\" he warned.\n\n\"We are the founding mothers and fathers of this new nation, our historical task is to lay the foundation of this new nation... To achieve that, we have to... overcome that hatred that has filled our hearts,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe this is our last opportunity and we must take this seriously and engage in dialogue.\"\n\nThe groups represented in the negotiations include the South Sudan United Front, Real-SPLM, South Sudan People's Movement and the National Salvation Front-Revolutionary Command Council, a splinter faction of the National Salvation Front which has refused to join the talks.\n\nKiir told an audience that included Kenyan President William Ruto that his government was ready to negotiate \"in good faith and with an open mind\", saying he hoped the rebels had \"similar convictions and a similar desire for peace\".\n\nNegotiations between Juba and the rebel groups began in 2019 but have failed to curb violence in the south of the country, despite a ceasefire signed in January 2020.\n\nOne of the world's poorest nations despite oil resources, South Sudan has endured natural disasters and an economic crisis, with political infighting fuelling further violence.\n\nSome nine million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN.\n\nThe crisis is compounded by the return of hundreds of thousands of South Sudanese refugees fleeing Sudan's brutal war.\n\nRead more:\n\nTwo charged in US conspiring to send arms to South Sudan worth millions of dollars", "source": {"uri":

All press and media institutions operating inside the country ceased operations, journalists have been displaced and lost their jobs. This interruption of professional and field news coverage has created a \"media blackout\" across the country, Kamal Elsadig, Editor-in-Chief of Radio Dabanga, told an online panel discussion organised by the Sudan offices of United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and UNESCO on Monday, in celebration of World Press Freedom Day, entitled The War in Sudan: What impact on media freedom?\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Sudan Media Forum,* a coalition of independent media outlets and organisations, Elsadig laments: \"The effects of the war are not limited to restricting freedom of the press. Both parties to the conflict are waging a propaganda war that has created media chaos. The respective warring parties and their agents have created dozens of websites, and fake accounts on social media platforms, to control the flow of information and spread false and misleading news, hate speech, and racism.\"\n\nSudan Media Forum\n\nIn the face of this tragic reality, independent media and press institutions in Sudan have united under the umbrella of the Sudan Media Forum to face the challenges posed by the war on press freedom and the dissemination of correct information, Elsadig says.\n\n\"As part of its commitment to collective action, the Sudan Media Forum has issued a declaration of principles and rules for journalistic coverage in wartime, which includes strict ethical commitments to ensure responsible and objective journalism during this difficult period.\"\n\nObjectives of the Sudanese Media Forum:\n\n* To collect, verify, and present information to the public in a fair, accurate, and independent manner.\n\n* To address fake news, misinformation and hate speech.\n\n* To disseminate the facts and promote a culture of peace and reconciliation.\n\n* To defending freedom of the press and the right to access information.\n\n* To develop a road map for the development of the media sector in Sudan.\n\nChallenges facing the sustainability of media work.\n\n\"Since the outbreak of war in Sudan, the independent press has faced many challenges that threaten its existence and role in society. The war has led to the closure of many media institutions, the disruption of the work of journalists, and the spread of misinformation, disinformation, and war propaganda,\" Elsadig says.\n\n\"The war has almost completely paralysed in the work of Sudan media institutions, especially those located in conflict areas. Journalists face great difficulty reaching the location of events, to carrying out their professional duties.\"\n\nBoth parties to the conflict are waging a parallel media war, creating media rooms to broadcast war propaganda, hate speech, and misinformation, with the aim of weaponising and influencing public opinion.\"\n\nElsadig highlights that in addition to suppressing media institutions, \"both parties to the conflict seek to silence the voice of independent journalists using threats, harassment, and accusations of subjugation and treason.\"\n\nHe explains that this reality imposed severe financial and logistical difficulties on independent newspapers, which has compromised their ability to publish, and in many cases, forced them to cease operations completely.\n\n\"Realising the scale of the challenges, independent news outlets in Sudan united to form the Sudan Media Forum, which has established a joint editorial platform to publish verified stories, to confront and counter the spread of misinformation and war propaganda. The forum also launched a solidarity and advocacy campaign with the hashtag #StandWithSudan, to address what has become the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe, the spectre of impending famine, and widespread human rights violations by all parties.\n\nThe Forum affirms its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of professional journalism, including accuracy, integrity, and independence,\" Elsadig concludes.\n\n* Amid the ongoing conflict in Sudan, independent media faces many challenges that threaten its existence and role in society.\n\nIndependent media faces significant challenges that threaten its existence and role in society. The Sudanese Media Forum appeals to the international community to provide urgent support and pressure on the parties to the war to achieve five basic demands:\n\n1. Immediately stop the war and facilitate the access of humanitarian aid to those affected without restrictions or conditions.\n\n2. Provide protection for male and female journalists, including foreign correspondents, so that they can perform their duties freely and safely. We also appeal to the international community to contribute to providing a First Aid Fund (IFAK) and all requirements for the First Aid protocol in combat conditions, as local media institutions lack this type of protection.\n\nWe stress the need to pressure both sides in the war to adhere to international treaties and agreements and international humanitarian law.\n\n3. Enabling both male and female journalists to move freely and independently with their equipment and tools to provide independent press coverage.\n\nWe stress the need to enable them to access any area or location without harassment or the imposition of restrictions, censorship, or conditions.\n\n4. We call for financial and logistical support for independent press institutions so that they can carry out their urgent, pressing, and required future work.\n\nWe emphasise that the curtailment of media and journalistic institutions inside Sudan due to the war has led to the truth being lost in a fog of war propaganda, lies, misinformation, and the spread of hate speech by both sides of the war.\n\n5. We call for providing the necessary support to the Sudan Media Forum to enable it to activate the joint media room and conduct media campaigns so that it can fulfil its desired role towards a bright future for journalism in Sudan.\n\nWe affirm that the Sudan Media Forum contributes effectively to stopping the war, bringing peace, and building a future Sudan based on freedom, justice, and a full democratic civil state.\n\nThese demands represent the minimum international support required to ensure a free and responsible press in Sudan.", "source": {"uri": "dabangasudan.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Dabanga"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Press_Freedom_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Press Freedom Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Dabanga", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio Dabanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_blackout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Media blackout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNESCO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.dabangasudan.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/434681445_122112530432257668_2163307387057509337_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543820", "eventUri": "eng-9543820", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

UNHCR staff saw the massive destruction caused by the war, with vast needs and high levels of suffering among a population which has been out of reach to humanitarians for months.\n\nDuring the two-day mission to Omdurman, which hosts over 12,000 refugees and more than 54,000 internally displaced people, UNHCR met with local officials and people impacted by the conflict to identify needs and understand the protection risks.\n\nDisplaced families, including Sudanese and refugees who were in Sudan before the war, told UNHCR of their struggles to get enough food due to soaring prices, leading to fears of children becoming malnourished. Children have no access to schools, or places to play, and they are distressed by the sounds of clashes. Displaced people do not have adequate shelter, with many living in overcrowded conditions in gathering sites located mainly in schools. While two hospitals remain open, there is not enough medicine, especially for those with chronic illnesses. Pregnant women are not able to access prenatal care. People also shared serious concerns for their safety, reporting increasing sexual violence as well as limited legal support. Many are severely traumatized.\n\nUNHCR identified relevant national agencies, NGOs and other community groups on the ground to whom we could offer support and supplies.\n\nBeyond Khartoum State, escalating hostilities in Darfur's El Fasher city are aggravating the already perilous protection situation for civilians. According to available reportsLink is external, tens of villages have been targeted, some razed to the ground, killing innocent people and destroying public property and crops. Indiscriminate violence, including sexual violence as well as cases of separated and missing children, are on the rise. Movement restrictions on key roads are preventing people from fleeing to safer areas, forcing them to shelter in severely overcrowded displacement sites or open spaces, adding to risks.\n\nUNHCR continues to call for the safety of civilians, safe access for aid agencies so that support and supplies can be delivered and, above all, for a cessation of hostilities. Humanitarian partners also need more support to boost their capacity to respond.\n\nUNHCR, alongside UN partners, remains in Sudan to support its people and continues to operate wherever it has safe access. In Khartoum, Darfur and Kordofan State, we are working with local partners, refugee leaders and community-based protection networks to monitor needs and assist where we can. We are also present in Red Sea, Northern, White Nile, Blue Nile, Gedaref and Kassala states, which host hundreds of thousands of refugees already in the country prior the conflict.\n\nNearly 6.7 million people have been internally displaced in Sudan, and the situation remains dangerous and volatile. The over 920,000 refugees in Sudan, mainly from South Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia, include over 200,000 who have been displaced several times within the country since the start of the war.\n\nA year on, thousands continue to leave Sudan daily in search of safety in neighbouring countries. To date, 1.8 million people have crossed into Chad, Egypt, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic.\n\nAs the humanitarian situation continues to worsen, financial resources needed to meet needs across Sudan and in neighbouring countries are dangerously insufficient. To date, only 10 per cent of the $2.6 billion required to reach over 18 million people with life-saving assistance within Sudan have been received, and only 8 per cent of the $1.4 billion financial requirements outlined in the 2024 Regional Refugee Response Plan for Sudan have been met.\n\nFor more information please contact:\n\nFor Sudan, Assadullah Nasrullah, nasrulla@unhcr.org, +254 113 676

We are extremely grateful to the EU for their contribution, which helped us save lives during this crisis.\"\n\nWFP says that with the support of the EU, it has been able to provide emergency food assistance to nearly 6.4 million people, of which around 550,000 people received cash, since the conflict erupted in Sudan just over one year ago.\n\n\"This was in part made possible with a EUR \u20ac28 million contribution from the EU Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) in 2023. The aid agency also used this funding to help treat and prevent malnutrition for 260,000 children and pregnant or nursing women,\" the WFP statement says.\n\nWFP has been warning that Sudan could become the world's largest hunger crisis during the upcoming lean season, which starts in May and lasts through October. Currently, during the harvest season, a record 17.7 million people already face acute food insecurity, while almost five million people are just one step away from starvation (IPC 4). The food security situation is expected to worsen even further in the coming months unless urgent action is taken to support those facing the highest levels of hunger.\n\nWFP points out that in 2024, the EU has mobilised an initial amount of EUR \u20ac117 million for the humanitarian response in Sudan, as well as an additional EUR \u20ac185 million to respond to the impact of the crisis in neighbouring countries. This new amount comes on top of the European Commission's humanitarian funding for Sudan in 2023, which totalled EUR \u20ac128 million.\n\n\"As WFP works to scale up its operations to avert the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe, the support of partners such as the EU -- one of our most generous partners in Sudan -- remains critical to WFP's efforts,\" the statement concludes.\n\nNGOs call on EU for 'urgent, strategic, and concrete steps'\n\nIn the run-up to the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan in Paris last month, and to mark a year since the outbreak of the conflict, several prominent international human rights organisations, press freedom advocates, and humanitarian organisations, have addressed a joint open letter to the High Representative of the European Union (EU) for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, Josep Borell Fontelles, as well as the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the EU member states, urging \"urgent, strategic, and concrete steps to respond to the massive cost on civilians of the dramatic human rights and humanitarian crisis in the country and prevent further violations\".\n\nIn an open letter, jointly signed by Amnesty International; Brot f\u00fcr die Welt (Bread for the World); Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies; Christian Solidarity Worldwide; Finn Church Aid, Finland, Free Press Unlimited, Front Line Defenders, Human Rights Watch, International Federation for Human Rights, International Service for Human Rights, and Protection International Institute, called on the EU and its member states \"to respond to this conflict urgently by engaging with the parties to the conflict and their regional supporters to stop all attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, and to end the deliberate obstruction of relief\".\n\n\u20ac896 million\n\nA statement by the European Commission on April 14, following the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan in Paris last month, points out that the European Commission has committed \u20ac355 million in both humanitarian and development funding for Sudan and its neighbours. Together with the pledge from EU States of \u20ac541 million, total EU support to Sudan pledged at the conference amounts to \u20ac896 million.\n\nThe European Commission's funding will be channelled via humanitarian organisations to the most vulnerable in need suffering from consequences of the conflict in Sudan itself, but also those who have sought refuge in neighbouring countries. EU aid will provide communities with health and nutritional care, food assistance, water and sanitation, shelter, protection, and education to the most vulnerable households - internally displaced, refugee families and host communities.\n\nAt the time, the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borell Fontelles, acknowledged: \"The one-year conflict in Sudan has created a catastrophic humanitarian situation. With half of the total population of the country at risk of starvation, the window to avoid the worst is quickly closing...\"\n\n\"With today's pledge of \u20ac896 million, the EU shows its determination to stand by the Sudanese people. Our priority continues to be the implementation of a ceasefire and the passage of humanitarian aid.\n\n\"The principle of accountability must be applied, also through the application of sanctions. We must strengthen coordination, including when it comes to mediation. And we need to continue to support civil society representatives so they can contribute to shape the peace process. The resolution of this conflict must be a priority for the international community, even in a global context marked by multiple crises.\"\n\n'Time running out'\n\nIn a statement on 3 May, WFP warns that \"time is running out to prevent starvation in Darfur as intensifying clashes in North Darfur's capital El Fasher hinder efforts to deliver vital food assistance into the region.\n\nCivilians in El Fasher and the wider Darfur region are already facing devastating levels of hunger, yet deliveries of food assistance have been intermittent due to fighting and endless bureaucratic hurdles. The latest escalation of violence around El Fasher has halted aid convoys coming from Chad's Tine border crossing - a recently opened humanitarian corridor that passes through North Darfur's capital.\n\nMeanwhile, restrictions from the authorities in Port Sudan are preventing WFP from transporting assistance via Adr\u00e9, the only other viable cross-border corridor from Chad. The route can serve West Darfur and other locations in Central, South and East Darfur. These access constraints are jeopardizing WFP's plans to provide vital assistance to over 700,000 people ahead of the rainy season when many roads across Darfur become impassable.\n\n\"Our calls for humanitarian access to conflict hotspots in Sudan have never been more critical: WFP urgently requires unrestricted access and security guarantees to deliver assistance to the families struggling for survival amid devastating levels of violence. We must be able to use the Adr\u00e9 border crossing and move assistance across frontlines from Port Sudan so we can reach people throughout the Darfur region,\" said Michael Dunford, WFP's Regional Director for Eastern Africa.\n\nWFP says that the recent surge in violence in El Fasher is exacerbating critical humanitarian needs in Darfur, where at least 1.7 million people are already experiencing emergency levels of hunger (IPC4). El Fasher had been a relative safe haven for families, hosting many IDP camps that pre-date the current conflict. Yet conditions were already critical with reports of children dying of malnutrition.\n\nNow many are being forced to flee El Fasher and surrounding areas - some for the second or third time - and are becoming increasingly vulnerable. On top of the impact of the escalating violence, WFP is concerned that hunger will increase dramatically as the lean season between harvests sets in and people run out of food.\n\n\"The situation is dire. People are resorting to consuming grass and peanut shells. If assistance doesn't reach them soon, we risk witnessing widespread starvation and death in Darfur and across other conflict-affected areas in Sudan,\" said Dunford.\n\nOver the last six weeks, WFP has delivered emergency food and nutrition assistance to over 300,000 people in North, West, and Central Darfur using the Tine and Adr\u00e9 border crossings and a crossline route from Port Sudan. These breakthroughs followed lengthy negotiations. But the progress appears to have been short-lived with all routes now blocked. WFP and the rest of the humanitarian community needs to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance consistently and at scale to prevent a worsening of the crisis, WFP stresses.", "source": {"uri":

Lazaro Sumbeiywo (rtd), the Government of Kenya appointed chief mediator for High-level Mediation for South Sudan, wrote Gen. Buoy an invitation letter on 2 May to the talks saying the High-Level Mediation for South Sudan is an important process for regional peace and stability.\n\nGen. Buoy replied on the same day acknowledging receipt of Lt. Gen. Sumbeiywo's letter and qualified that his outfit is not a member of the South Sudan Opposition Movement Alliance (SSOMA).\n\n\"Firstly, I would like to bring your kind attention to the fact that the SSPM/A, a group formed in 2021, is not part of the holdout groups known as the South Sudan Opposition Movement Alliance (SSOMA), which has been negotiating with the government of South Sudan in Rome since 2020,\" he wrote. \"We aim to fight for fundamental regime change in the Republic of South Sudan, driven by our belief in the need for a more inclusive and democratic government.\"\n\nGen. Buoy said that as an organization, SSPM/A is deeply committed to the pursuit of sustainable peace in South Sudan and views the Government of Kenya's initiative to foster inclusivity in the peace process with utmost importance.\n\n\"Therefore, we affirmatively respond to your call for the SSPM/A to join the negotiation table with some concerns that we expect to be addressed,\" he stated. \"Firstly, we insist that our security must be guaranteed while in Kenya so that we can fully participate in the peace negotiations without any worries. Secondly, we demand that our travel documents be processed before we arrive in Ethiopia from our base in South Sudan. We hope you understand that these concerns are crucial to our participation, and we expect them to be addressed as soon as possible. We look forward to the fruitful peace negotiations.\"\n\nIn reply to Gen. Buoy's concerns, Lt. Gen. Sumbeiywo wrote back reassuring the rebel leader about his team's security in Kenya.\n\n\"I wish to acknowledge the concerns you have raised about the safety of your delegation to the High-Level Mediation for South Sudan. With regard to your security and safety, H.E. Dr. William Samoei Ruto, the President of the Republic of Kenya, has provided a detailed security guarantee which should suffice,\" he reassured. \"In short, he (President Ruto) has stated in writing: 'I hereby give my unequivocal assurance to you and all South Sudanese that your security within Kenyan territory will be guaranteed. I have issued directives to the relevant security agencies to put in place the necessary protocols to ensure that your security as well as that of your family, delegations, associates, and indeed, all South Sudanese in Kenya is assured during the talks and beyond.' Indeed, the directive of His Excellency the President has been implemented.\"\n\nLt. Gen. Sumbeiywo also informed Gen. Buoy that the mediation is convened under the auspices of the Government of Kenya and that the High-Level launch will be on 10 May 2024 at State House, Nairobi. Further, the mediation will build on the previous achievements and agenda set with Sant'Egidio, who are also invited as co-mediator.\n\n\"In view of the foregoing, I urge your attendance at the Mediation here in Nairobi, Kenya, as soon as possible, in order to join hands with other South Sudanese in this opportunity in search of peace in your beloved country,\" the chief mediator wrote.", "source": {"uri": "radiotamazuj.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Tamazuj"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan_Opposition_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan Opposition Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kenya", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of Kenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ruto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Ruto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nairobi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Kenya", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Kenya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://radiotamazuj.orghttps://radiotamazuj.org/media/cache/resolve/article_opengraph_image/uploads/media/663a0f74ad42f/sbr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543820", "eventUri": "eng-9543820", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 438, "textEnd": 443}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

This was in part made possible with a EUR \u20ac28 million contribution from the EU Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) in 2023. The aid agency also used this funding to help treat and prevent malnutrition for 260,000 children and pregnant or nursing women.\n\n\"Amid escalating conflict and rising hunger, sufficient funding is critical to meet increasing humanitarian needs. We are extremely grateful to the European Union for their contribution, which helped us save lives during this crisis,\" said Eddie Rowe, WFP Sudan Country Director and Representative.\n\nWFP has been warning that Sudan could become the world's largest hunger crisis during the upcoming lean season, which starts in May and lasts through October. Currently, during the harvest season, a record 17.7 million people already face acute food insecurity, while almost 5 million people are just one step away from starvation (IPC 4). The food security situation is expected to worsen even further in the coming months unless urgent action is taken to support those facing the highest levels of hunger.\n\nIn 2024, the EU has mobilized an initial amount of EUR \u20ac117 million for the humanitarian response in Sudan, as well as an additional EUR \u20ac185 million to respond to the impact of the crisis in neighbouring countries. This new amount comes on top of the European Commission's humanitarian funding for Sudan in 2023, which totaled EUR \u20ac128 million.

News Agency (MENA) on the sidelines of their participation in the Sudanese Forces Conference hosted by Cairo yesterday, Wednesday, the Sudanese forces stressed that the security of Sudan and Egypt is an indivisible part, considering that Sudan's security is an extension of Egyptian national security, and that stability in Sudan means consolidating the pillars of security, peace, and harmony in the region.\n\nThe Sudanese political forces stated that the \"Sudanese Forces Conference\" witnessed the signing of a document that includes a vision for managing the transitional founding period; with the aim of presenting a unified political vision to deal with the Sudanese crisis and pave the way for a Sudanese-Sudanese dialogue that presents a political roadmap for a comprehensive solution to the crisis.\n\nIn this context, Mustafa Tambor, President of the Sudan Liberation Movement, affirmed that the \"Cairo Conference,\" which witnessed the gathering of a large number of Sudanese political forces, is an exceptional and very important event, as all those forces gathered out of a sense of national responsibility towards the Sudanese people and the interests of the homeland.\n\nTambor added that the Sudanese political forces discussed the Sudanese political crisis in a detailed and comprehensive manner, and presented a vision to contain this crisis, and also presented clear visions to end the state of division that has negatively affected the entire Sudanese state, and agreed on the need to move forward under the banner of the homeland to lead Sudan to

political leadership for its unlimited support for Sudan and its people.\n\nHe pointed out that the Egyptian leadership deals with Sudan from a historical responsibility because Sudan's security is an indivisible part of Egypt's security, and that stability in Sudan will undoubtedly have a positive impact on Egypt.\n\nFor her part, Dr. Shada Osman Omar Al-Sharif, a leader in the original Federal Democratic Party, said that the gathering of Sudanese political and national forces in Cairo is considered a historic day that resulted in the issuance of the Sudanese Forces Charter document, in which the parties and blocs agreed on a roadmap to manage the transitional period in an effort to settle the crisis and return life in Sudan to normal.\n\nThe leader in the \"original Federal Democratic Party\" explained that the Sudanese forces that met in Cairo represent the real legitimacy in Sudan, pointing out the agreement of the forces to provide unlimited support to the armed forces in their efforts to restore life to normal.\n\nShe indicated that Sudan is living a real crisis, an existential crisis that requires the concerted efforts of local, regional, and international efforts, and that everyone must stand together in an effort to get out of the dark tunnel.\n\nRegarding her assessment of the Egyptian role in dealing with the Sudanese crisis, Dr. Shada Al-Sharif expressed her sincere thanks to the Egyptian political leadership for its constant keenness to support Sudan in its crises.\n\nShe stated that Cairo has made great efforts to settle the Sudanese issue, and stood by the Sudanese people in their recent ordeal, where it received large numbers of refugees after the outbreak of war in Sudan.\n\nShe highlighted that Egypt's historic role in dealing with the Sudanese crisis is not surprising to Egypt, the leader of the Arab nation, pointing out that Egypt's destiny is to carry the concerns and issues of the Arabs from the Atlantic to the Gulf.\n\nShe noted that President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi places the Sudanese issue at the top of Egypt's foreign policy priorities, considering that Sudan is a national security issue for the Egyptian state, and that Sudan's security is an indivisible part of Egypt's security, noting that the Egyptian political leadership is a wise leadership that is open to the world and to the Arab and regional environment.\n\nFor his part, the President of the Sudanese Ba'ath Party, Yahya Al-Hussein, affirmed that Egyptian-Sudanese relations are deeply rooted in history, pointing out that Cairo's role in supporting Khartoum is not new to it, but it has always been the supporter and backer of Sudan throughout history.\n\nYahia Al-Hussein praised the Egyptian state for embracing this large number of

Now picture the same land ravaged by conflict, its people facing a relentless foe - hunger. This is the stark reality for Sudan, a country where decades of civil war and ongoing economic hardship have left millions struggling to put food on the table. According to the World Food Programme, over 25 million people are scattered across Sudan, South Sudan, and Chad and are \"trapped in a spiral\" of food insecurity. However, the brutal civil war shows no sign of easing after 10 months of fighting. This crisis, fueled by a complex web of factors, demands a multifaceted approach that prioritizes innovation, community empowerment, and international collaboration.\n\nSudan's terrain is deeply scarred by decades of civil war, both physically and psychologically. Numerous lives were lost in the North and South's fighting, which also severely damaged agricultural output. The displacement of millions from their ancestral lands disrupted the customary food production methods. \"Everything was taken from us by the war,\" laments Darfuri farmer Aisha. \"Our crops failed, our livestock perished, and hunger became a constant threat.\" The quotation was taken from first-hand reports that humanitarian organizations had collected.\n\nWith the recent secession of South Sudan, another layer of complexity was added. Previously shared oil revenues, a crucial source of income, were divided, and trade routes were disrupted. This economic instability further strained Sudan's ability to ensure food security for its citizens.\n\nTaking care of hunger in war-torn Sudan demands a dedication to national and local conflict resolution and peacebuilding. A stable peace is necessary to foster an atmosphere that supports food security since conflict and poverty impede trade, market access, and agricultural output.\n\nMoreover, investing in conflict resolution mechanisms, community reconciliation initiatives, and social cohesion programs can help rebuild trust and solidarity within communities, laying the foundation for long-term stability and development.\n\nSupporting rural development and agriculture is one of the main tenets of a long-term strategy to end hunger in Sudan. Sudan can boost food production, raise incomes, and lessen its dependency on food aid by enhancing the resilience of smallholder farmers, expanding their access to markets and agricultural inputs, and encouraging sustainable farming methods.\n\nMoreover, investing in irrigation infrastructure, water management, and climate-smart agriculture can help mitigate the impact of climate change on food security and build the resilience of communities to environmental shocks and disasters.\n\nAlthough women are essential to Sudan's food production, processing, and distribution chains, they frequently encounter structural obstacles when trying to get access to land, loans, and agricultural inputs. Targeted interventions, such as financial services, agricultural training, and land rights access, can empower women farmers and enable them to become change agents and contributors to the food security of their communities.\n\nFurthermore, promoting gender equality and women's empowerment can have ripple effects beyond the agricultural sector, contributing to broader social and economic development goals and fostering more inclusive and resilient societies.\n\nTo lessen the effects of food insecurity and make sure that communities are able to endure shocks and strains and bounce back, resilience building is crucial. During difficult times, vulnerable populations might benefit from investments in social protection programs like cash transfers, food vouchers, and nutrition services, which act as a safety net and save them from sinking even farther into poverty and hunger.\n\nFurthermore, promoting diversified livelihoods, investing in education and skills training, and strengthening social networks and community institutions can enhance the resilience of households and communities, enabling them to cope with adversity and thrive in the face of uncertainty.\n\nAddressing hunger in war-torn Sudan is not just a humanitarian imperative; it is a moral obligation and a strategic necessity for the country's long-term stability and prosperity. By tackling the root causes of food insecurity, investing in agriculture and rural development, empowering women, promoting peacebuilding and conflict resolution, and building resilience, Sudan can break the cycle of hunger and build a future where every citizen has access to nutritious food, economic opportunity, and a life of dignity and hope.\n\nAs the international community rallies behind Sudan in its quest for peace and development, let us not forget the millions of Sudanese whose lives hang in the balance, their hopes and dreams for a better future overshadowed by the specter of hunger.\n\nIt is time for action, solidarity, and collective resolve to ensure that no one in Sudan goes to bed hungry and that every child has the opportunity to thrive and fulfill their potential.",

Screenshot from the France24 YouTube Channel\n\nFor the victims of Sudan's civil war, a humanitarian crisis and human rights violations have become part of their everyday lives.\n\nIn the Republic of Sudan, there is an ongoing civil war between two opposing military factions: the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) under General Abdel Fattah al Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (FSR) under General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemeti. This war stems from the country's dark past and chaotic governance under former president Omar al-Bashir from 1989 to 2019. This conflict, which follows three bloody conflicts, began on April 15, 2023, and is the fourth civil war in this country's history. The first conflict lasted from 1955 to 1972, the second from 1983 to 2005 and the third from 2003 to 2020.\n\nThe ever-evolving situation only adds to the turmoil that displaced persons, who are the war's primary victims, experience. On January 31, 2024, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that this war has displaced almost 8 million people.\n\nTo better understand the on-field situation, Global Voices interviewed Hatim Abdulaziz, a humanitarian project management expert and office head for the non-governmental organization Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO).\n\nJean Sovon (JS): What is the current human rights situation in Sudan?\n\nJS: Both factions are blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid to the displaced persons camps. Are Hemeti and Burhan doing this on purpose?\n\nJS: At present, is it safe to say that the chances of finding peace and stability in Sudan are dwindling?\n\nJS: Following the separation from South Sudan in 2011, are you worried that the current Sudan will separate again?\n\nOvershadowed by the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, this conflict receives little international media coverage.

This was in part made possible with a EUR \u20ac28 million contribution from the EU Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) in 2023. The aid agency also used this funding to help treat and prevent malnutrition for 260,000 children and pregnant or nursing women.\n\n\"Amid escalating conflict and rising hunger, sufficient funding is critical to meet increasing humanitarian needs. We are extremely grateful to the European Union for their contribution, which helped us save lives during this crisis,\" said Eddie Rowe, WFP Sudan Country Director and Representative.\n\nWFP has been warning that Sudan could become the world's largest hunger crisis during the upcoming lean season, which starts in May and lasts through October. Currently, during the harvest season, a record 17.7 million people already face acute food insecurity, while almost 5 million people are just one step away from starvation (IPC 4). The food security situation is expected to worsen even further in the coming months unless urgent action is taken to support those facing the highest levels of hunger.\n\nIn 2024, the EU has mobilized an initial amount of EUR \u20ac117 million for the humanitarian response in Sudan, as well as an additional EUR \u20ac185 million to respond to the impact of the crisis in neighbouring countries. This new amount comes on top of the European Commission's humanitarian funding for Sudan in 2023, which totaled EUR \u20ac128 million. As WFP works to scale up its operations to avert the risk of a humanitarian catastrophe, the support of partners such as the EU - one of our most generous partners in Sudan - remains critical to WFP's efforts.\n\n/Public Release.

Unfortunately, South Sudan has been grappling with internal conflicts and political instability since 2005. Various opposition groups since then have emerged, challenging the government's authority and the leadership of President Salva Kiir. What happened on 15 December 2013 in Juba started simply as an - SPLM leadership debate on democracy within the Party but ended up as a civil war. The rightful aspiration of the members of the SPLM to contest for the position of the chairman of the Party was once considered a rebellion, and that was unacceptable. The struggle for power as it evolved perfectly reflected the scenery of the animal farm, with many people rejecting the fact that some people would like to be more equal than others.\n\nAs announced by the country authorities and a few steps taken towards its realization, there is no doubt that there will be a new round of negotiations between the South Sudan government and the opposition left-out groups in Kenya mediated by the able General Lazaro Sumbeiywo. These negotiations present both challenges and opportunities for the country's future. They are crucial in achieving lasting peace and stability in the country but also fraught with complexities that need to be addressed for successful outcomes.\n\nThe challenge facing the negotiations between the South Sudan government and the opposition left-out groups is the growing mistrust between the parties and the leaders. Lack of genuine engagement in the talks hindered the success in the previous rounds of negotiations in Rome (Italy). Since 2005, the South Sudan government has engaged in several negotiations with many opposition groups. It had reached and signed several peace agreements with many of the groups. None of these agreements negotiated and inked has been fully implemented, as all were dishonoured. This sad reality has created a significant level of animosity and suspicion, making it difficult for any of the new opposition groups to engage with the government in meaningful dialogues, as they all know how peace agreements end in South Sudan.\n\nBuilding trust and confidence between the opposing parties is crucial for the success of any negotiation process, but this is a daunting task given the recent history. Peace negotiations between South Sudanese are often characterized by a series of provoked defections, changes of alliance and betrayals, which is an intriguing phenomenon of political infidelity. Another challenge is the lack of a unified opposition front, with various splinter groups having different agendas and evolving demands. The government has often exploited that reality and successfully continues to divide the ranks and files of the opposition, masterminding defection and maintaining its grip strongly on power. The loud echo of the failure in the governance of the country doesn't seem to bother the leadership of the government and the ruling party as it is preparing to present the same leadership branding and programme for the upcoming election.\n\nThe fragmentation within the opposition, in general, reflects its weakness, but within the left-out groups further complicates the negotiation process. It will be challenging to address the diverse interests and grievances of all parties involved. Coordinating and aligning the positions of these disparate groups is essential for reaching a comprehensive and inclusive agreement that addresses the root causes of the conflict. The issue of power-sharing and resource allocation will also be another major challenge in the negotiations. Peace negotiations literature and past experiences have demonstrated that the distribution of political power, resources, and access to public services remain the most contentious issues that often lead to deadlock in negotiations. South Sudan government and the opposition left-out groups must strive to find a way to address these issues fairly and equitably to all parties. Failure to reach a consensus on these critical issues could undermine the sustainability of any peace agreement reached.\n\nDespite the challenges, the negotiations between the South Sudan government and the opposition left-out groups also present significant opportunities to silence the guns and achieve lasting peace and stability in the country. One such opportunity is the potential for inclusive governance arrangements that accommodate the interests of all parties currently in conflict with the government. By ensuring that all stakeholders have a seat at the table and a voice in decision-making processes, the negotiations can pave the way for a more inclusive and representative government that reflects the diversity of South Sudan's population.\n\nThe negotiations also provide an opportunity for the left-out groups to join the ongoing peace process and build on what has already been achieved in the Revitalized peace agreement and the national dialogue. Contribute to the efforts intended to address the root causes of conflicts and work towards sustainable solutions that promote peace, reconciliation, and healing. By engaging in dialogue and negotiation, the South Sudan government and the opposition left-out groups should thrive to identify the underlying grievances that have fueled conflicts and continue to heighten tensions in the political scene. Explore and develop strategies to address them effectively.\n\nThis process of truth-telling and accountability is essential for building a foundation of trust and reconciliation that can help prevent future conflicts. Another opportunity presented by the negotiations is the potential for international support and mediation. The involvement of the Republic of Kenya, besides the other regional and international actors, can provide valuable expertise, resources, and diplomatic leverage to facilitate the negotiation process and ensure compliance with any agreements reached. International support can also help hold both parties accountable for their commitments and provide a framework for monitoring and evaluation to track progress towards peace and stability in South Sudan by ensuring the full implementation of the agreement.\n\nThe negotiations between the South Sudan government and the opposition left-out groups are critical for achieving just and lasting peace and stability in the country and the region. While there are significant challenges to overcome, including deep-rooted mistrust, fragmentation within the opposition and latent war for the leadership of the opposition. The opportunities would include the potential progress towards inclusive governance and reconciliation, as well as the valuable support of Kenya and the international partners for the peace agreement negotiation and its implementation. By addressing these challenges head-on and seizing the opportunities presented by the negotiation process, South Sudan can move closer towards a future of peace, prosperity, and unity for all its citizens where no one will be left out or behind.", "source": {"uri": "sudantribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sudan Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan_People's_Liberation_Movement", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan People's Liberation Movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Juba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_Kiir_Mayardit", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salva Kiir Mayardit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Failed state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consociationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peace treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Representative democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://sudantribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Francis-Nazario-150x150.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543820", "eventUri": "eng-9543820", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-12-15", "textStart": 444, "textEnd": 460}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Entry to the exclusive event, held annually at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, now comes with a hefty price tag of $75,000 per individual ticket for the year 2024, as per Financial Express. This marks a significant increase from the $50,000 price tag in 2023, reflecting the growing allure and exclusivity of the event.\n\nThe event has evolved from its modest beginnings in 1995 when individual tickets were priced at a mere $1,000. In addition to the steep individual ticket prices, guests also incur substantial expenses when booking tables at the gala. Prices for a 10-seater table start at an astounding $350,000. Despite the steep price points, the New York Times reported that the event raised approximately $26 million, marking a $4 million increase over last year's total.\n\n\"There are very few other events that raise this kind of money,\" said Rachel Feinberg, a fund-raising consultant who has worked on galas in New York City. Indeed - there are few instances that could make the kind of splash that the Met Gala does, all while being financially feasible. And yet, the proceeds seem to not make their way to terrorised, oppressed zones in need of liberation and aid. Here's where that money could have been better spent:\n\nPalestine\n\nAs per CNN, the United Nations estimated that Palestinians need more than $1.2 billion in urgent humanitarian relief, with more than 90% of that for Gaza residents. As of January 2024, just over half of the required emergency funding had been provided. A data chart provided by CNN clearly shows all the areas where the Met Gala proceeds could have been put to use, hypothetically making leaps and bounds in areas such as food security and protection.\n\nSudan and South Sudan\n\nThe conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces has elevated Sudan to the forefront of the 2024 Emergency Watchlist, pushing the nation perilously close to collapse. In less than a year of conflict, the number of people requiring humanitarian assistance has more than doubled.\n\nIn Darfur, reports from human rights organizations indicate widespread mass killings and forced displacement based on ethnic divisions. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate significantly, leaving millions without adequate food and unable to reach essential healthcare and other vital services.\n\nFurthermore, since gaining independence from Khartoum in 2011, South Sudan has been plagued by insecurity. As the conflict across the border in Sudan escalates, there are growing concerns that it could further destabilize South Sudan's delicate economy and exacerbate political tensions. Additionally, the country is grappling with an economic crisis and heightened flooding, which are adversely affecting families' ability to access food. Presently, a staggering 9 million people in South Sudan require humanitarian aid, which translates to 72% of the population.\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nIn 2023, violent clashes erupted in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) following the breakdown of a ceasefire between the government and the M23 armed group. This intensified an already prolonged crisis, exposing millions of Congolese to conflict, political tensions, economic hardships, climate-related disasters, and recurring disease outbreaks. As the country enters 2024, it faces the daunting task of providing humanitarian assistance to 25.4 million people -- surpassing any other nation in terms of humanitarian need, as per the International Rescue Committee's 2023 report.\n\nThe severity of the crisis has overwhelmed services, leading to heightened levels of food insecurity and contributing to the spread of illnesses. Additionally, insufficient humanitarian funding and widespread insecurity have hindered efforts by aid workers to reach communities in need.\n\nThese three pertinent global causes are simply the tip of the iceberg as far as humanitarian crises go. The International Rescue Committee contains a detailed report of devastating crises that must be paid heed to, yet go unnoticed. A bleak sense of media responsibility and even bleaker forms of reporting further rub salt in the open, festering wounds of such causes.\n\nAs we struggle to come to terms with this dystopian reality that we are a part of, where a small percentage flaunts its wealth in shamefully extravagant ways while a vast majority struggles to afford a single meal, one can only pray that this has all been a nightmare from which we must collectively jolt awake.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

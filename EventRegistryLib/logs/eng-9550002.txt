They planned to use a two-part process: First, they would use IVF, where an egg is combined with a sperm in a lab, and second, they would work with an agency to hire a surrogate who would have the fertilized egg implanted and would carry the baby to term. They planned to have the IVF covered by insurance and planned to pay for the surrogacy out of pocket.\n\nBriskin took a job as an assistant district attorney at the New York County District Attorney's Office in Manhattan in 2017, and he learned soon after that the city's health plan doesn't cover IVF benefits for gay men. Briskin left that job in March 2022, but he is still covered under the city's plan through a federal law called COBRA, which allows employees to continue to receive health care coverage from their former employer for up to three years if they pay the full premium.\n\nThe couple filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April 2022 and hoped that it would encourage the city to change its policy. However, that didn't happen.\n\nPeter Romer-Friedman, who runs his own firm, Peter Romer-Friedman Law PLLC, based in Washington, D.C., said the city responded to the EEOC charge with a position statement arguing that it doesn't provide IVF benefits to surrogates and, as a result, it would not provide benefits to Briskin and Maggipinto. Romer-Friedman called the city's argument a red herring, because he said Briskin and Maggipinto have never sought any benefits for a surrogate.\n\n\"They're seeking fertilization of donated eggs with their sperm, and those are things that are provided to other people under the plan,\" Romer-Friedman said. \"So, in our view, the city offered no legitimate, legal or factual explanation for treating Corey and Nicholas differently than other couples who get IVF benefits.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman is representing the couple alongside David Lopez, who was general counsel for the EEOC from 2010-2016.\n\nA city hall spokesperson said Mayor Eric Adams' administration \"proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need.\"\n\n\"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation,\" the spokesperson said. \"The city will review the details of the complaint.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman said that in order to bring a lawsuit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law that prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin, a party is required to first file an EEOC complaint. After a six-month EEOC investigation, the party can choose to go to court.\n\nThe couple's lawsuit argues that the city's exclusion of gay men from being eligible for IVF benefits violates Title VII, the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment and New York state and New York City human rights laws.\n\nThe city categorically denies IVF benefits to gay men because it requires employees to meet its definition of infertility in order to qualify, the suit argues. The city defines infertility as the inability to conceive a child through male-female unprotected intercourse in a consecutive 12-month period or through intrauterine insemination, or IUI. Under this definition, single women and lesbian couples can qualify as infertile and receive IVF benefits if they undergo IUI and don't become pregnant, according to the complaint.\n\n\"But gay men, although equally incapable of conceiving a child without IVF, are always denied access to IVF under the City's healthcare plan,\" the complaint states. \"By defining 'infertility' in this exclusionary manner, single female employees, female employees with male partners, female employees with female partners, and male employees with female partners are always potentially eligible for some IVF benefits under the City's healthcare plan, but gay male employees -- whether individually or with male partners -- are never eligible for any IVF benefits.\"\n\nThrough its health care plan, the suit argues, the city \"denies gay men equal treatment and makes it much harder for gay men to have biological children than other employees and their partners.\"\n\nSince 2022, Briskin said, he and Maggipinto have started their journey to become parents. They have received donated embryos that are awaiting transfer to a surrogate, and they hope to have their first child within the next year. However, they are paying for all of the services out of pocket. So far, they have spent about $80,000, and they just received another $9,000 medical bill this week for prescription medications necessary for the IVF process, they said. They expect to pay about $100,000 for the IVF costs, and surrogacy can cost an additional $165,000, according to documents filed with the couple's 2022 EEOC complaint.\n\nDue to the costs, Briskin left the public sector and took a job at a private law firm.\n\n\"I certainly had to make the difficult decision to leave the public sector, which I clearly felt very strongly about -- I worked as a public servant for the first decade of my career,\" Briskin said. \"And that decision was driven in large part by our need to make sure that we can finance this ourselves.\"\n\nBriskin said they've mostly received support from those who have heard about their case, and that people have been \"flabbergasted at the notion that we are even having to have this fight in New York City in 2024.\" But the couple has had a few critics, they said, who have argued that Briskin and Maggipinto don't need the benefits because they are both lawyers.\n\nMaggipinto said they have been fortunate enough to be able to save money to have children, but that their fight isn't about money.\n\n\"If this were just about the money, we would have pursued a settlement with the city and not bothered with all the frustration that this brings, but if there's any point that I would want to make, it's that the policy needs to change,\" Maggipinto said. \"I would love the city to just answer the question directly: What exactly is the holdup? Why are you denying us equal treatment? They've come up with nothing.\"\n\nSince the couple filed their EEOC charge, Romer-Friedman said that 10 New York City council members introduced a bill to offer IVF benefits to city employees regardless of whether they can meet the city's definition of \"infertility,\" and two federal courts have held that health care plans that exclude same-sex couples, specifically lesbian couples, from IVF benefits may violate federal nondiscrimination laws, such as Title VII.\n\nCurrently, just seven states, including New York, require IVF benefits to include same-sex couples, according to a report from nonprofit news website Stateline, though these policies don't explicitly require coverage for gay men.\n\nFor more from NBC Out, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nCORRECTION (May 9, 2024, 12:55 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the law firm for which Peter Romer-Friedman works.

It could expand coverage for workers nationwide", "body": "A gay couple is suing New York City for denying them in vitro fertilization benefits, claiming the city's current healthcare plan discriminates against gay male employees.\n\nThe class action lawsuit lawsuit was filed Thursday by former New York City assistant district attorney Corey Briskin and his husband, Nicholas Maggipinto. The couple claims the city's healthcare plan has \"categorically excluded\" gay male employees and their partners from receiving IVF benefits, despite offering those same benefits to employees in different-sex relationships, single women and women in same-sex relationships.\n\nThis is the first class action lawsuit to argue that employers must provide gay male employees IVF benefits if those same benefits are offered to other employees, according to a press release from the law firm working with the plaintiffs.\n\nIf successful, the law firm representing Briskin and Maggipinto says the case could extend fertility benefits to gay male couples across the country.\n\n\"We're looking to change the entire legal landscape so that gay men are not going to ever be excluded from IVF,\" Peter Romer-Friedman, the founder of civil rights and class action law firm Peter Romer-Friedman Law PLLC, told USA TODAY.\n\n'Still a lot of hurdles': For LGBTQ+ couples, the path to in vitro fertilization is harder\n\nThe lawsuit claims that New York City's healthcare plan violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by denying them IVF coverage offered to other employees.\n\nThe issue lies in the city's definition of \"infertile\" as the inability to conceive a child through male-female sexual intercourse or through a procedure called intrauterine insemination, or IUI, in which prepared sperm is placed directly in a uterus.\n\nUnder this definition, same-sex couples can be deemed infertile after 12 months of unsuccessful attempts to conceive. Same-sex and single female partners can be deemed infertile if they are unable to get pregnant with IUI. But the lawsuit argues that this leaves no way for men to qualify as infertile, making it \"much harder\" for gay men to have biological children.\n\nPlaintiffs estimate that the city's \"outdated\" definition has deprived of IVF and family-building benefits to \"hundreds and possible thousands\" of city employees. Without such benefits - which cover 75% of IVF costs, according to the lawsuit - gay couples are left paying more out-of-pocket for the costly procedure.\n\nA single round of IVF \u2012 a medical procedure where eggs and sperm are combined in a lab dish and then transferred into a uterus \u2012 can cost tens of thousands of dollars. That, combined with surrogacy costs, means gay men can expect to pay more than $177,950 to conceive a biological child, according to estimates from the advocacy group Men Having Babies.\n\nInstead, the lawsuit points to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's recently-updated definition of infertility, which includes those who cannot achieve a successful pregnancy due to \"medical, sexual, and reproductive history, age, physical findings, diagnostic testing, or any combination of those factors.\"\n\n\"(Healthcare) plans that cover infertility need to stay up-to-date on current medical practices,\" said Betsy Campbell, chief engagement officer at Resolve, an infertility advocacy organization. \"Our hope is that all plans and laws will reflect this updated definition of infertility that is inclusive of all people who are struggling to build their families.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says Briskin and Maggipinto have been wanting to grow their family through IVF since 2017.\n\nBriskin asked former Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration in 2021 to provide him and other gay male employees equal IVF benefits but was denied, according to the lawsuit. The couple went on to file a discrimination charge against New York City with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the following year.\n\nThe city has argued that Briskin and Maggipinto were ineligible for IVF benefits because its healthcare plan does not provide benefits to surrogates, according to the lawsuit. The couple, in turn, argued that they were not seeking reimbursement for any surrogacy charges and \"simply wanted coverage for the same IVF services\" provided to other employees.\n\nThe couple was granted a \"right to sue\" letter from the Department of Justice in March.\n\nIs IVF tax deductible? IVF may be tax deductible, but LGBTQ+ couples less likely to get write-offs\n\nThe lawsuit names Mayor Eric Adams and former mayor Bill de Blasio as defendants. A city hall spokesperson told USA TODAY the city would review the details of the complaint.\n\n\"The Adams administration proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need,\" reads the statement. \"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n\nBriskin left his role as assistant district attorney in 2022 but remains covered by the city's healthcare plan through COBRA. Last year, Briskin and Maggipinto went forward with fertility treatment without IVF coverage provided by the city, which they claim would have awarded them tens of thousands of dollars in benefits.\n\nThe lawsuit says the couple had donor eggs fertilized with their sperm late last year and hopes to transfer the embryos to a surrogate later this year.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial insemination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_Reproductive_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Society for Reproductive Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill de Blasio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Family_and_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Family and Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mLoOk5pyOVkdcVKcmfxt9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xMDc3O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_money_325/c70897d9a48e8316ccfc121cb566ed08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550002", "eventUri": "eng-9550002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Under the city's insurance, employees are entitled to coverage for up to three rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in their quest to have children -- that is, unless they are gay men.\n\nIn a class action lawsuit filed Thursday, which appears to be the first federal case specifically about gay men's access to IVF, a former city employee and his spouse claim that by denying them benefits available to all other employees, the city is engaging in discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation. Nothing else, they argue, explains why they were treated differently.\n\n\"There is no legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for why the City's healthcare plan would offer IVF benefits when the male plan participant's partner is female but withhold IVF benefits when the male plan participant's partner is male,\" the complaint, filed in federal court in New York, states.\n\nNew York City offers generous IVF benefits to its 300,000 employees and their dependents, including for single women, women in same-sex relationships, and men with female partners. This coverage extends to couples that plan to use donor eggs. The only exception is for gay men.\n\nThe city requires people wanting to access IVF services to be infertile, which it defines as an inability to conceive through heterosexual sex or intrauterine insemination -- a set of criteria which disqualifies only gay men. Last year, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine updated its definition of infertility to include LGBTQ people, but New York City has not yet followed suit. The city's infertility requirement, according to the complaint, leads to sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, state and city human rights laws, and the New York and United States constitutions.\n\nThe story behind the lawsuit goes back to 2017, when Corey Briskin began working as a prosecutor at the Manhattan district attorney's office. He and his husband, Nicholas Maggipinto, were ready to start a family and looked forward to taking advantage of the city's IVF benefits. They were surprised and deeply saddened when their request to use those benefits was quickly denied. The couple petitioned the city to change its policy to no avail.\n\nThe city's refusal was both a financial and an emotional blow. There was \"an additional kind of pain which was rooted in my sacrifice that I had made to be a public servant,\" Briskin told Mother Jones. \"To know that I was working alongside other public servants who had made a similar sacrifice, but yet were being given the opportunity to grow their families with the support of our employer, of the city -- that had a uniquely profound impact on me.\"\n\nThey also felt that the city was sending the couple a message it didn't want them to be parents, when compared to colleagues who had no trouble getting IVF covered. \"'You're just outside of what we support,'\" Maggipinto said. \"That's the way it felt.\"\n\nIn 2020, New York state mandated that health care plans serving over 100 employees offer IVF benefits, and barred discrimination based on sexual orientation. That same year, in the landmark case Bostock v. Clayton County, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Title VII the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. But despite these developments, the city refused to change its policy and cover IVF for Briskin and Maggipinto. So in 2022, the couple filed a class action charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a necessary step before filing a Title VII case in federal court.\n\nAt first, the city's only response to the EEOC proceedings was a statement defending its policy on the grounds that it does not provide benefits to surrogates. But not only had Briskin and Maggipinto not asked the city to cover the cost of a surrogate, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, the couple's lawyer, the EEOC discovered that the city would provide IVF benefits to couples using a surrogate -- as long as it wasn't a gay male couple. The EEOC investigation dragged on for two years. In March, officials greenlit the couple's lawsuit.\n\n\"The city should be embarrassed by what they filed at the EEOC,\" says Romer-Friedman. \"It didn't grapple with the actual allegations. It didn't provide real facts or real law when it comes to these issues.\"\n\nWhile members of New York's city council have twice introduced legislation to make its IVF policy inclusive of gay men, including this year, it has not passed. Romer-Friedman believes that Mayor Eric Adams and the city's Office of Labor Relations could change the policy unilaterally, and, under the state law mandating IVF coverage, have a responsibility to do so.\n\n\"Whether or not they agree with us legally, it's wrong and unfair,\" says Romer-Friedman. \"And it's not as if the cost of these benefits would make a difference to the city. It's a rounding error when you consider how much money the city spends on health care for city employees, spouses, children, retirees.\"\n\nThe complaint names the city as the defendant along with Adams, his predecessor Bill deBlasio, and the current and former commissioners of the Office of Labor Relations. The mayor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe city's intransigence has been both baffling and hurtful to Briskin and Maggipinto. \"I was actually really hopeful that this was an issue of oversight, that they just didn't realize,\" says Maggipinto. \"I still am stunned that this is going on for this long. It really makes me question the motives of the individuals making the decisions at City Hall.\"\n\nIn 2022, Briskin left the district attorney's office for a clerkship. The following year, the couple began paying for IVF. That's when \"I made the tough decision to jump ship and move into the private sector, mainly because we had mounting bills related to our family building journey,\" Briskin said. \"Yet another impact of the policy on our lives.\"\n\nIn filing this class action, the couple hope not only to recoup their expenses and change New York City's policy, but to set precedent under Title VII that would help countless other gay people trying to start families. As employers increasingly include IVF in benefits packages, including for LGBTQ employees, in recent months, courts have begun to see workplaces that deny such benefits to LGBTQ people as a form of sex discrimination. Last week, Aetna settled a lawsuit filed by a lesbian couple that had to pay out of pocket for fertility treatments. As of last fall, 21 states require some employers to provide fertility coverage of some kind, but only eight of them include LGBTQ and single people. New York is one.\n\n\"This is one of the most important questions after the Bostock decision that federal courts could answer about the rights of gay and lesbian employees,\" says Romer-Friedman.

Under the city's insurance, employees are entitled to coverage for up to three rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in their quest to have children -- that is, unless they are gay men.\n\nIn a class action lawsuit filed Thursday, which appears to be the first federal case specifically about gay men's access to IVF, a former city employee and his spouse claim that by denying them benefits available to all other employees, the city is engaging in discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation. Nothing else, they argue, explains why they were treated differently.\n\n\"There is no legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for why the City's healthcare plan would offer IVF benefits when the male plan participant's partner is female but withhold IVF benefits when the male plan participant's partner is male,\" the complaint, filed in federal court in New York, states.\n\nSubscribe to our briefing for insights into how politics impacts the LGBTQ+ community and more.\n\nNew York City offers generous IVF benefits to its 300,000 employees and their dependents, including for single women, women in same-sex relationships, and men with female partners. This coverage extends to couples that plan to use donor eggs. The only exception is for gay men.\n\nThe city requires people wanting to access IVF services to be infertile, which it defines as an inability to conceive through heterosexual sex or intrauterine insemination -- a set of criteria which disqualifies only gay men. Last year, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine updated its definition of infertility to include LGBTQ people, but New York City has not yet followed suit. The city's infertility requirement, according to the complaint, leads to sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, state and city human rights laws, and the New York and United States constitutions.\n\nThe story behind the lawsuit goes back to 2017, when Corey Briskin began working as a prosecutor at the Manhattan district attorney's office. He and his husband, Nicholas Maggipinto, were ready to start a family and looked forward to taking advantage of the city's IVF benefits. They were surprised and deeply saddened when their request to use those benefits was quickly denied. The couple petitioned the city to change its policy to no avail.\n\nThe city's refusal was both a financial and an emotional blow. There was \"an additional kind of pain which was rooted in my sacrifice that I had made to be a public servant,\" Briskin told Mother Jones. \"To know that I was working alongside other public servants who had made a similar sacrifice, but yet were being given the opportunity to grow their families with the support of our employer, of the city -- that had a uniquely profound impact on me.\"\n\nThey also felt that the city was sending the couple a message it didn't want them to be parents, when compared to colleagues who had no trouble getting IVF covered. \"'You're just outside of what we support,'\" Maggipinto said. \"That's the way it felt.\"\n\nIn 2020, New York state mandated that health care plans serving over 100 employees offer IVF benefits, and barred discrimination based on sexual orientation. That same year, in the landmark case Bostock v. Clayton County, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Title VII the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. But despite these developments, the city refused to change its policy and cover IVF for Briskin and Maggipinto. So in 2022, the couple filed a class action charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a necessary step before filing a Title VII case in federal court.\n\nAt first, the city's only response to the EEOC proceedings was a statement defending its policy on the grounds that it does not provide benefits to surrogates. But not only had Briskin and Maggipinto not asked the city to cover the cost of a surrogate, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, the couple's lawyer, the EEOC discovered that the city would provide IVF benefits to couples using a surrogate -- as long as it wasn't a gay male couple. The EEOC investigation dragged on for two years. In March, officials greenlit the couple's lawsuit.\n\n\"The city should be embarrassed by what they filed at the EEOC,\" says Romer-Friedman. \"It didn't grapple with the actual allegations. It didn't provide real facts or real law when it comes to these issues.\"\n\nWhile members of New York's city council have twice introduced legislation to make its IVF policy inclusive of gay men, including this year, it has not passed. Romer-Friedman believes that Mayor Eric Adams and the city's Office of Labor Relations could change the policy unilaterally, and, under the state law mandating IVF coverage, have a responsibility to do so.\n\n\"Whether or not they agree with us legally, it's wrong and unfair,\" says Romer-Friedman. \"And it's not as if the cost of these benefits would make a difference to the city. It's a rounding error when you consider how much money the city spends on health care for city employees, spouses, children, retirees.\"\n\nThe complaint names the city as the defendant along with Adams, his predecessor Bill deBlasio, and the current and former commissioners of the Office of Labor Relations. The mayor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe city's intransigence has been both baffling and hurtful to Briskin and Maggipinto. \"I was actually really hopeful that this was an issue of oversight, that they just didn't realize,\" says Maggipinto. \"I still am stunned that this is going on for this long. It really makes me question the motives of the individuals making the decisions at City Hall.\"\n\nIn 2022, Briskin left the district attorney's office for a clerkship. The following year, the couple began paying for IVF. That's when \"I made the tough decision to jump ship and move into the private sector, mainly because we had mounting bills related to our family building journey,\" Briskin said. \"Yet another impact of the policy on our lives.\"\n\nIn filing this class action, the couple hope not only to recoup their expenses and change New York City's policy, but to set precedent under Title VII that would help countless other gay people trying to start families. As employers increasingly include IVF in benefits packages, including for LGBTQ employees, in recent months, courts have begun to see workplaces that deny such benefits to LGBTQ people as a form of sex discrimination. Last week, Aetna settled a lawsuit filed by a lesbian couple that had to pay out of pocket for fertility treatments. As of last fall, 21 states require some employers to provide fertility coverage of some kind, but only eight of them include LGBTQ and single people. New York is one.\n\n\"This is one of the most important questions after the Bostock decision that federal courts could answer about the rights of gay and lesbian employees,\" says Romer-Friedman.

Donate today\n\nA class-action lawsuit filed on Thursday accuses New York City of discriminating against same-sex male couples who want to use in vitro fertilization to conceive children.\n\nThe city's health plan provides coverage for up to three rounds of IVF for members who can prove they are infertile. But gay men -- unlike straight couples, lesbians or single women -- cannot meet the city's infertility standards because they require members to first try and fail to get pregnant through other methods, according to the lawsuit. A male couple would typically use IVF to create embryos with an egg donor, and then have a surrogate bring the child to term.\n\nThe lawsuit comes even as some local lawmakers are seeking to make the city's fertility coverage more equitable through legislation and as some large health providers are broadening coverage for IVF services in response to legal challenges.\n\nCorey Briskin, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan who is still on the city's health plan, and his husband Nicholas Maggipinto, filed the suit against the city. The pair live in Brooklyn and previously filed a complaint about the city's IVF policy with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2022. But that agency's investigation into the matter was taking so long they decided to go to court, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, the couple's attorney.\n\nDocuments related to EEOC complaints are generally not public. Brandalyn Bickner, a spokesperson for the agency, said it is prohibited from even confirming the existence of a complaint.\n\nLiz Garcia, a spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams, said on Thursday that the city's policy accords with state requirements around IVF coverage. She added that the health plan only covers city employees and their dependents -- regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation -- but not \"surrogates.\"\n\nBriskin and Maggipinto argue that they are not requesting any surrogacy benefits; rather, they say they are requesting the same IVF benefits other city employees receive. According to their lawsuit, the Adams administration made the same argument in response to the EEOC complaint.\n\nThe city's employee health plan defines infertility for a couple as the inability to get pregnant after 12 months of regular, unprotected sex, or artificial insemination with donor sperm. For those over 35, the standard is six months. But same-sex male couples don't have the option of trying and failing at these methods first, the lawsuit says.\n\nIt argues that the city should use a broader definition of infertility, from the nonprofit American Society for Reproductive Medicine, that includes anyone who needs medical intervention to achieve a successful pregnancy. This would inherently include all gay men, regardless of whether they're single or in a couple, the lawsuit notes.\n\nBoth Briskin and Maggipinto, who met at law school, now work in the private sector and have started the process of having a child on their own, they said in a joint interview this week. They said they have spent about $80,000 of their own money on IVF, which has involved working with an egg donor to create embryos.\n\nThey plan to eventually enlist the help of a surrogate to carry the child -- a step that can cost upward of $100,000, according to the New York Surrogacy Center, a law firm specializing in surrogacy. Since the city health plan doesn't cover surrogacy, the couple was always preparing to pay that expense themselves.\n\n\"We had to take money that was allocated toward paying a surrogate, which we knew was never going to be covered by insurance ... and put it toward IVF,\" Maggipinto said in the interview, ahead of the court filing. \"It definitely set us back, I would say, at least a year and a half since we started the process, because we had to come up with more money.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman, their attorney, added that Briskin and Maggipinto are \"some of the lucky ones who are able to cobble together the very significant resources that are required to go through this process without insurance covering the benefits.\" He said he has spoken with other city employees who can't afford to move forward with the process without any insurance coverage.\n\nSome city councilmembers are pushing to force the city to change its policies, regardless of the outcomes of the lawsuit. Queens Councilmember Lynn Schulman, who chairs the Council's health committee, introduced a bill in March to require the establishment of city employee benefits that cover some or all of the costs of assisted reproduction and adoption \"without conditioning reimbursement on an infertility diagnosis.\" The bill has 10 sponsors so far.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit against New York City is one of several recent efforts to create equal access to IVF and other reproductive assistance for LGBTQ+ people, as coverage for such services becomes more common.\n\nEarlier this month, health insurer Aetna agreed to pay out $2 million to members as part of a settlement to a 2021 lawsuit alleging Aetna's fertility coverage was discriminatory because it required same-sex couples to pay for artificial insemination out of pocket before becoming eligible for IVF. In the settlement, Aetna agreed to change its policies and adopt the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's broader definition of infertility.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs also agreed to expand access to IVF coverage under its health plan, after facing two separate legal challenges last year. The VA previously only covered IVF for married couples who could produce their own egg and sperm. Now, it will additionally cover the procedure for unmarried veterans and those who use donated sperm or eggs.\n\nIn 2020, New York began requiring large group health plans to cover up to three cycles of IVF. A growing number of states have similar mandates, though eligibility rules vary, according to health policy nonprofit KFF. State insurance laws also don't apply to so-called \"self-funded\" employer plans, which are regulated by federal law.", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"},

But, the couple told Gay City News in a joint interview two years ago, they later learned that their insurance plan did not cover benefits \"because we didn't satisfy the definition of infertility.\"\n\nThe couple said at the time that they could not afford the out-of-pocket expenses associated with IVF services. Briskin described his government salary as one that paid him only \"a fraction\" of the salaries of other attorneys who graduated with him.\n\nThey sought to rectify the issue diplomatically, but that went nowhere, forcing them to file a class action discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n\nAs the EEOC investigated the case, however, the couple became aware that the city covers IVF for other employees in the same situation as them: For example, when a male employee's female partner is unable to produce viable eggs, the city will pay for the fertilization of the eggs the couple receive from a female donor, they said -- and even in cases with females who are viable but not covered by insurance, the city will pay the costs of fertilizing her eggs. But when gay male couples attempt to seek to fertilize donated eggs, they are not covered.\n\nThis, the couple alleges, amounts to discrimination in violation of federal, state, and local anti-discrimination laws, in addition to the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the United States and New York Constitutions. Even after filing the EEOC complaint, the couple says, the discriminatory policy continues. According to NBC News, the couple's attorneys said an EEOC complaint is required, along with a six-month investigation, before advancing a lawsuit under Title VII.\n\nNew York has taken steps to make it easier for LGBTQ individuals to start families, including the state's legalization of gestational surrogacy. A New York State Department of Financial Services directive from 2021 told insurers to \"provide immediate coverage of diagnostic and treatment services... for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility ('basic infertility treatments') for individuals who are unable to conceive due to their sexual orientation or gender identity and are covered under individual, small group, and large group health insurance policies and contracts.\"\n\nSome members of the City Council seem to agree on the need for further reform. A City Council bill proposed in March by out Queens Councilmember Lynn Schulman and co-sponsored by nine others -- including LGBTQIA+ Caucus Co-Chairs Erik Bottcher of Manhattan and Tiffany Cab\u00e1n of Queens -- would require the city to cover some or all of the costs of assisted reproduction without conditioning it on an infertility diagnosis or discriminating on the basis of marital or partnership status.\n\nThe plaintiffs, however, are hoping their case reverberates beyond the confines of the five boroughs. Their attorneys -- Peter Romer-Friedman, who comes from a civil rights and class action law firm, and former general counsel of the EEOO David Lopez -- hope that the case could mandate employers across the US to provide IVF benefits to gay male employees.\n\n\"Gay men are entitled to equal treatment in the workplace, including when employers like the City of New York offer IVF benefits to their employees,\" Romer-Friedman said in a written statement. \"The City of New York is treating gay men like second-class citizens when it comes to IVF benefits. While we're prepared to fight as long as it takes to win equal treatment for gay male employees of the City of New York, we hope that the city's leaders will work with us now to reform this discriminatory policy and ensure that all city employees and their partners can access IVF.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor said the city would review the details of the complaint.\n\n\"The Adams administration proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need,\" the mayor's office told Gay City News. \"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.\"", "source": {"uri": "gaycitynews.com",

Clayton County decision that affirmed protections for LGBTQ+ employees under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nAt least two federal court decisions, one in California and another in Illinois, have since said that a health-care plan that excludes IVF for same-sex couples or imposes greater costs for them to use it than other couples can be deemed discriminatory, according to Thursday's complaint.\n\nThe complaint seeks an injunction to end the city's current policy that restricts coverage of IVF treatment for same-sex male couples.\n\nThe New York City health plan defines \"infertility\" as the inability to conceive through male-female sexual intercourse or through intrauterine insemination for 12 months, according to the complaint.\n\n\"In this case, the City of New York has not just made it harder for gay men like Mr. Briskin and Mr. Maggipinto to qualify for IVF benefits,\" the complaint says, \"the City has made it impossible for gay men to qualify for IVF benefits.\"\n\nThe office of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is also named in the complaint along with former Mayor Bill de Blasio, said it is reviewing the suit.\n\n\"The Adams administration proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need,\" a city hall spokesperson said in a statement. \"The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n\nLegal history\n\nThe question of access has also been raised on a federal level. The Biden administration in March announced it was amending its IVF guidelines to extend the benefits to veterans and active servicemembers who are single or in same-sex relationships.\n\nThe New York City employee health care plan covers 75% the costs of IVF, including associated tests and procedures, according to the complaint.\n\nBriskin and Maggipinto said they successfully created embryos last year without the plan's coverage.\n\nThe couple previously filed a discrimination charge with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April 2022, and was given a \"right to sue\" letter from the Department of Justice, their complaint said.\n\nThe city argued in a position statement following the EEOC charge that the two were asking for benefits related to a surrogate -- which are not covered -- but Briskin and Maggipinto countered they were only asking for coverage of egg retrieval and fertilization in the same manner that the service is covered for other couples.\n\nBriskin left the city to clerk for a federal judge in January 2022, but he and Maggipinto remain covered under the city plan through COBRA.\n\nThe complaint says the city's health-care policy violates Title VII, the New York State and City Human Rights Laws, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the US and New York State Constitutions.\n\nBriskin and Maggipinto are represented by Peter Romer-Friedman and Patrick David Lopez of Peter Romer-Friedman Law PLLC.\n\nLopez served as the general counsel for the EEOC from 2010 to 2016, where he advocated to advance protections for LGBTQ+ workers under Title VII.", "source": {"uri": "crainsnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crain's New York Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bostock_v._Clayton_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bostock v.

Adams, and other City leaders have unlawfully discriminated against gay male City employees and their partners.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest development in the couple's dispute with the city. In 2022, the men filed a discrimination claim against the city with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The men asked the agency to close its investigation so that they could sue.\n\nAt issue is whether a municipal employee is considered \"infertile,\" a condition that the city defines as the inability to conceive a child through male-female unprotected sexual intercourse over a consecutive 12-month period or through intrauterine insemination, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn IVF, eggs are collected from ovaries and fertilized in a laboratory by sperm.\n\nIn an emailed statement, Liz Garcia, a spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams, who is a defendant in his official capacity, did not deny that the plaintiffs were excluded from the benefits.\n\n\"The Adams administration proudly supports the rights of LGBTQ+ New Yorkers to access the health care they need. The city has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. The city will review the details of the complaint.\"\n\nRomer-Friedman said the couple -- both lawyers who have been together since 2011, married since 2016 and now residents of Williamsburg, Brooklyn -- have since gone through the process of getting donated eggs, fertilized with each of their sperm, and are hoping for implantation sometime this year. They have spent tens of thousands of dollars in the process, and Briskin ultimately decided to leave the public sector and go into private practice to help pay for IVF out of pocket.\n\nThe couple are not seeking to cover costs related to surrogates -- the woman who carries the pregnancy -- which are not covered under municipal health insurance for anyone.\n\nThe suit seeks damages, as well as attorneys fees and findings that the city is violating the Civil Rights Act, state and city human rights laws, and the constitutions of New York and United States, and orders for a policy reversal, and certification as a class action.\n\nBriskin is still on the city insurance plan under COBRA, the Continuation of Health Coverage policy.\n\nIf the city policy were reversed, Romer-Friedman said, \"It will mean that ordinary workers who have modest salaries -- like teachers or cops or garbage people -- can get the IVF they need to grow their families. It's incredibly costly to go through this process.\"\n\nThere is legislation pending before the City Council that would extend IVF benefits beyond the current criteria. Romer-Friedman said it would help couples like his clients prospectively but the lawsuit wouldn't be mooted because it seeks to recoup the money Maggipinto, Briskin and other gay men who were denied benefits had to spend out of pocket.\n\nBefore he was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, Briskin had also been an assistant district attorney in Nassau County. The couple's wedding was officiated, in 2016, by the then-former Nassau district attorney, Kathleen M. Rice, who had become a congresswoman at the time of the ceremony, according to a New York Times wedding announcement.

If they succeed, they will set a legal precedent that defines all gay men as infertile regardless of their medical history, and employers across the US will be under pressure to offer the same fertility benefits to gay men as they do to women and heterosexual couples.\n\nBriskin began working for the city of New York in 2017 - a year after his marriage to Maggipinto - and both he and his spouse were entitled to healthcare coverage with EmblemHealth through the city's comprehensive benefits plan. When they began researching their reproductive options that year and read the wording of the EmblemHealth policy, they discovered that, as gay men, they were the only class of people to be excluded from IVF coverage. They were not seeking for the cost of surrogacy to be covered.\n\nThe policy defines infertility as the inability to conceive a child after 12 months of unprotected heterosexual sex, or through intrauterine insemination. Straight people, lesbians and single women employed by New York City's government are therefore eligible for infertility benefits covering the cost of IVF, but same-sex male couples can never qualify.\n\nMaggipinto and Briskin's complaint uses the revised definition of infertility adopted by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) in October 2023, which characterises infertility as \"a disease, condition or status\" which \"requires medical intervention - including donor gametes\" to achieve a successful pregnancy. Under this definition, all gay men and lesbians are infertile.\n\n\"If our legal position in this case is upheld, it will mean that the inclusive definition of infertility that the ASRM has set forth would be the law of the land,\" their lawyer, Peter Romer-Friedman, said. \"It will send a strong and resounding message to employers across the country that they have to provide these benefits, and they could be on the wrong side of enforcing action if they refuse.\"\n\nThe advocacy group Men Having Babies estimated that the total cost of conceiving a child for gay men using IVF and surrogacy in 2023 was $177,950 - $261,550 for domestic intended parents in the US. Briskin was earning $75,000 a year as a New York assistant district attorney and Maggipinto, a corporate lawyer, was saddled with student debt.\n\n\"There is no reasonable alternative to IVF for gay men seeking to conceive biological children,\" their complaint reads. \"When benefits are not available from an employer or a healthcare plan to cover the cost of IVF for people who are unable to conceive through male-female sexual intercourse, that substantial financial burden ordinarily forecloses their opportunity ever to have biological children.\"\n\n\"New York City employs over 300,000 people,\" Maggipinto said. \"These are the people that keep one of the greatest, largest and most progressive cities in the world running. And these are the same people that are now effectively having the government decide whether they can have children or not.\"\n\nIn their complaint, Briskin and Maggipinto argue that the city's position furthers prejudice against gay fathers, advancing \"sex- and sexual orientation-based stereotypes that gay male couples and single gay men are not fit to be parents, while single women, women in different-sex or same-sex relationships, and men in different-sex relationships are\".\n\nThe legal anti-discrimination framework for LGBTQ+ people has evolved over recent years. In the 2020 Bostick decision, the US supreme court ruled that Title XII protects gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination. The same year, group health insurers in New York were legally required to cover three cycles of IVF, and in 2021 the New York department of financial services informed insurers this coverage had to be offered regardless of an employee's sexual orientation.\n\nIn a statement made after Briskin and Maggipinto filed their complaint to the EEOC, a city hall spokesperson said: \"New York City has been a leader in offering IVF treatments for any city employee or dependent covered by the city's health plan who has shown proof of infertility, and our policies treat all people covered under the program equally, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation.\"\n\n\"There have been ample opportunities for the city to have changed the policy over the past two years and they haven't, without explanation,\" Briskin said.\n\nBriskin has moved to work in the private sector, he said, \"for the primary purpose of being able to bring in additional income that I knew we would need to get ourselves through this process\". Since changing jobs, he and Maggipinto have become able to fund IVF treatment and find a surrogate. They have frozen embryos that they hope to transfer this month. \"Even with my private sector salary combined with Nicholas's, it still proves to be a challenge for us.\"\n\n\"This is one of the most important civil rights issues that could be heard at this time,\" said Romer-Friedman. \"A bill that changes policy going forward would be fantastic, but it would not address the harm that has occurred in the past. Part of what we're trying to achieve is compensation and an apology for all the families and single gay men who have been impacted by this blatantly discriminatory policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenny_kleeman@theguardian.com", "name": "Jenny Kleeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equal Employment Opportunity Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_de_Blasio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill de Blasio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial insemination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Family_and_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Family and Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual_Addiction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexual Addiction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f38cb9755dd284a8a123a3bee3dc411e80e5cd/0_860_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=93424a7daaf958a802ce04af9bf24a36", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550002", "eventUri": "eng-9550002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

But when you take into consideration everything all together, all at once you will find that there is a grave racial disparity in the number of white IVF babies compared to number of Black IVF babies.\n\nSince 1978, when the first successful IVF cycle was performed, the number of American families who have taken advantage of fertilization technology number in the millions. Yet, in 2024 there is an enormous difference drawn upon racial lines in the number of mothers who have full access to reproductive medicine. And for the Black and Hispanic mothers who do gain access, there remains a gap in the number of successful IVF live births.\n\nData collected by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinical Outcomes Reporting System (SART CORS) for the years 1999 and 2000, showed that the live-birth rate for white women is 26.3%, which far outpaced the live-birth rate for Black women who had successful IVF cycles of only 18.7%. The study concluded that being Black was an independent risk factor for not achieving a live birth. A subsequent data analysis performed from 2004 to 2006 showed that things have not changed much. Numerous other studies produced comparable results.\n\nBecause of such findings, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) was moved to do something about those racial inequities. The ASRM then analyzed SART CORS data from 2014 to 2016. Of the 122,721 IVF cycles available for study, on 13,717 were from Black women. White women, on the other hand, accounted for 109,004 of the cycles studied. It should come as no shock that Black women also had a lower livebirth rate than white women.\n\nNow couple all these data findings with the U.S Census finding out that white deathrates are rising much faster than white birthrates, and give that some thought...\n\nNo. There is no known Great White Breeding Conspiracy where white folk are subduing the birthrate of Black and Hispanics. Data on U.S. birthrates shows that quite the opposite has been happening. In recent years, people of color have been as fruitful as ever, if not more fruitful.\n\nIn 2022 for instance, a US Census fertility rate analysis showed that for every 1,000 Native Hawaiian women an estimated 64 children would be born. That is the highest fertility rate for all races. The fertility rate for white women, on the other hand, was hovering next to last with only 51 children per 1,000 women. The fertility rate for Black women were somewhere in the middle with 53 births per 1,000 women.\n\nFertility rates, however, should never be confused with birthrates. Whereas, a birthrate is an accounting of live births, a fertility rate is merely an estimate of the number of children who might be born to a woman of childbearing years -- ages 15 to 44 years old. Know, too, that the fertility rates for industrialized nations (like America) always run lower than less industrialized nations.\n\nThe offset for this fertility shortfall comes with a high price tag.\n\nDepending on the fertility clinic, IVF care can cost as much as $30,000. Also realize that miscarriages are to be expected with the IVF process, so costs can easily be doubled or even tripled.\n\nThis disparity in IVF numbers is not due to a selective process that is barring Black babies from being created. The lopsided numbers are due to the greatest and most effective segregationist tool of them all -- finance.\n\nThere are only two ways to pay for IVF treatment. The most obvious is to pay cold-hard cash. (If you do not have the cash, you might charge it on a credit card, or take a home equity loan, or attempt to get an IVF grant.) The only other way to cover the costs is with insurance coverage.\n\nYes. There is insurance available, but not for everyone and not in every state.\n\nIn September 2023, the National Infertility Association reported that 21 states along with DC passed fertility insurance coverage laws. Laws that include IVF coverage were present in 15 of those state mandates, and fertility preservation coverage was included for families that experience a medically induced (iatrogenic) infertility. At least 16 of those 21 states have some form of mandated coverage, Texas is one of those states.\n\nIn Texas, a single IVF cycle will cost approximately $10,600, plus any additional costs that normally begin at around $6,600. It is most probable that there could be several cycles before a couple achieves a successful pregnancy and live birth. Typically, insurance coverage for IVF treatment is usually limited to three cycles per lifetime. Coverage in Texas requires a qualifying patient couple to have an infertility history of at least 5 years; or the couple must have a specified medical condition resulting in infertility.\n\nAn advocate for IVF procedures will tell you that IVF replicates the natural childbirth process. But when you consider all a woman must endure you will find that there is nothing natural about it.\n\nTo start, a woman undergoing the IVF process is injected with gonadotropins (synthetic hormones), so her ovaries are stimulated to produce multiple eggs. The eggs are then retrieved by a physician so they can be delivered to an embryologist who inseminates the eggs with the patient's choice of sperm. Now, the patient must wait a few days for the embryos to develop.\n\nAbout five days later, the embryos are transferred into the woman's uterus occurs; or her spare embryos might be frozen for later implantation.\n\nThen it is a waiting game to see if a viable pregnancy occurs. If the attempt to impregnant fails -- or in the case of an ensuing miscarriage -- the woman must repeat the cycle from the start.\n\nWhen IVF was created, it was designed for women with damaged or blocked tubes that prevented the sperm from meeting the egg. Now, with the advancement of technology and more successful pregnancies, IVF treatment has been made available to women with other contributing infertility factors.\n\nProspective parents who are good candidates for IVF treatment can now be those whose doctor has diagnosed them with: blocked fallopian tubes, low sperm count, severe endometriosis, or any other unexplained infertility issue.\n\nDespite technological advancements, IVF treatment is still a haphazard endeavor. The participating clinicians can, however, provide a patient with statistics based on a couple's age, ovarian reserve, the sperm quality of a partner or donor, and other relevant medical factors.\n\nStill, a hopeful parent must accept that miscarriages are part of the IVF process.\n\nData shows that after 7 weeks of gestation, with a fetal heart activity detected, almost 10% of women who are younger than 33 years old suffer an IVF miscarriage. Then as a woman grows older the miscarriage rate gets worse. For women aged 33-34 years old the rate of miscarriage is over 11%; women aged 35-37 suffer miscarriages at a rate of nearly 14%; the rate is close to 20% for women aged 38-40; for women aged 41-42 the rate is close to 30%; and, for women over 42 years old the miscarriage rate is almost 37%.\n\nIt is an accepted rule that childbearing years for women caps-out at age 49...but increasingly that capstone rule is being ignored as women who are desperate to have a child push the rule beyond its limits.\n\nOn September 1, 1946, Erramatti Mangamma was born. On September 5, 2019, Erramatti gave birth to twin girls. Erramatti was 73 years old at the time.\n\nTheoretically, any woman who can afford it can have a child of her very own -- that is as long as Republicans who oppose a woman's right to life decisions stays out of her way.\n\nRecent Republican generated legislation like the Life at Conception Act (January 2023) have caused fear and panic for both IVF patients and physicians, because with the hypocrisy surrounding the right to life issues, they are not sure if a mistake in the handling of an embryo might not land them in prison.\n\nMost recently, 35-year-old Sarah Houston, an Alabama nurse and radical cancer survivor, wanted to expand her family by having her healthy IVF embryos transferred to a surrogate. Houston was aghast when she received a call from the IVF clinic saying that her entire process had been put on hold because of their fear of repercussion and the liability that could be associated with the new Republican-generated legislation.\n\nIn Mid-March 2024, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (Democrat) spoke in support of IVF treatment for our nation's veterans. His backing was for the Veteran Families Health Services Act, which was introduced by U.S. Senator Patty Murray (Democrat).\n\nBlumenthal, a right to life advocate, declared that oppositional Republican politicians are, \"...in favor of IVF. But not against laws that restrict IVF.\" At most, the Republican stance on IVF, says Blumenthal, conflicts with constitutional law and moral principles.\n\nLost amid this political rancor are the reproductive rights of Black women to have equitable access to IVF treatment, because their infertility might be greater than that of white women.\n\nA sample analysis of nearly 500 non-surgically sterile women, showed that 48% of the group's Black women reported infertility compared to only 31% of white women. Ironically, the Black women were younger than the white women, less likely to have been married, had never given birth to a child (nulliparous), and more often of lower income and education.\n\nThe thing that separates a prospective Black mother from a white mother is the unfortunate fact that being Black in this case, too, continues to be a foretelling factor for the livebirth rate as a result of IVF treatment. The nuanced economic and social factors found in reproductive medicine and the U.S. healthcare system at large -- and the implicit biases found in those structures -- also contribute to the failure to allow Black women access to IVF treatment.\n\nDespite the immeasurable reward IVF might provide to families, it is important to note that only about 2% of all live births in the U.S. are the result of IVF treatment.", "source": {"uri": "northdallasgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Dallas Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Teena and her husband chose IVF after exhausting various treatment options to have a child. She was in her late 40s when she gave birth to a boy in 2022.Teena and her husband are among an increasing number of couples opting for IVF in Kerala.\n\n\"Mostly, couples in their 40s opt for IVF,\" says Dr Vivek Kumar, an infertility specialist at Kinder Hospital in Kochi.\n\n\"People usually try other treatments before opting for IVF. There are situations where the couple refuses to accept the treatment despite doctors suggesting it. They choose IVF later.\"\n\nExperts attribute the significant rise in the number of people opting for IVF over the past 10 years to its accessibility, affordability and greater awareness.\n\n\"The cost of IVF treatment is much cheaper compared to a decade ago. Success rates are higher and the technology and the materials used have evolved,\" Dr Vivek points out.\n\nThe secretary of the Indian Fertility Society's Kerala chapter, Dr Raju Nair, says, \"People with indications and who have late marriages prefer the treatment for fast results.\"\n\nPrevalence of lifestyle diseases and the rising marital age are among other reasons for the popularity of IVF, points out Dr Reji Mohan, associate professor with the department of reproductive medicine at the Government Medical College in Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n\"Also, young couples often prefer to have a child once they are settled and financially stable. As women grow older, chances of conception decrease. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise, etc. can be linked to it. Further, partners may not be staying together or may migrate to other countries as well. This can also be a factor contributing to infertility,\" he says.\n\nDr Reji says the sperm count and quality too are decreasing these days.\n\n\"Most of the time, doctors prescribe IVF treatment because of the social pressure the couple is facing,\" he says.\n\nSome couples can possibly make it a normal pregnancy if they wait for six months or a year, says Dr Vivek.\n\n\"But the couple isn't convinced and is encircled with questions, peer pressure and family pressure. The doctor is thus forced to prescribe IVF. The couple need to have the liberty to choose when they are mentally, physically and financially stable for it,\" he stresses.\n\nCouples who don't have children experience social pressure though it varies according to their backgrounds, age and profession, says Dr Raju, who is also the head of the fertility unit at the Mitera Hospital, Thellakam, in Kottayam district. \"Such couples also choose this option as an easy solution,\" he says.\n\nFurther, he says the social stigma around the treatment is waning. \"Even if there is resistance initially, people opt for it once they realise IVF is the solution for the issue. Counselling and better clarification about the scenario help couples make the decision,\" he says.\n\nIn line with the trend, many IVF centres too have been established in the state over the past few years, Dr Reji says.\n\n\"Earlier, anyone with a degree in gynaecology could establish a centre. According to the 2021 Act, only trained persons can start an IVF centre. There are Level 1 and Level 2 classifications.

We live in Alabama.\n\nThat Friday evening, Feb. 16, 2024, unaware of the ruling, Gabby started taking her stimulation medications, worth roughly US$4,000 in total. We didn't hear about the decision until Sunday morning, Feb. 18. By then, she had taken four injections - or two doses - of each of the stimulation medications.\n\nFor those who don't know, the IVF process is a winding journey full of tests, bloodwork and bills. An IVF patient takes hormones for eight to 14 days to stimulate their ovaries to produce many mature eggs. The mature eggs are then retrieved via a minor surgical procedure and fertilized with sperm in a lab. The newly created embryos are monitored, sometimes biopsied and frozen for genetic testing, and then implanted, usually one at a time, in the uterus. From injection to implantation, one round of IVF takes four to eight weeks.\n\nIVF can be as stressful as it is exciting. However, the potential of having a successful pregnancy and our own child at the end of the process, we hoped, would make it all worth it. The decision by the Alabama Supreme Court threw our dreams up in the air.\n\nI study politics - I don't practice it. I'm not involved in state or local government. I'm a scholar, not an activist or an advocate. But now one of the most intimate, personal events of our lives had been turned into a political event by the state's highest court. As a result, I became something else, too, which I had not been before: an activist.\n\nIf embryos are children, as the court ruled, then fertility clinics and patients would be exposed to an immense amount of potential legal liability. Under this new framework, patients would be able to bring wrongful death suits against doctors for the normal failures of embryos in the testing or implantation phase. Doctors would either have to charge more for an already expensive procedure to cover massive legal-insurance costs or avoid IVF altogether.\n\nThe decision and its implication - that IVF could not continue in the state of Alabama - felt like a personal affront to us. We were infuriated to have this uncertainty injected into the process three days into injecting IVF medication.\n\nWhile the decision clearly imperiled the future of IVF in Alabama, it was not clear to us whether we would be allowed to continue the process we had begun. We were left completely in the dark for the next four days. Gabby and I had no choice but to continue daily life and IVF as though nothing was happening.\n\nFor me, that meant teaching my political participation course at Auburn University.\n\nTeaching politics when it gets personal\n\nI'll never forget walking into class on Monday, Feb. 19, and telling the students about the court's ruling and how it - maybe? - was going to jeopardize Gabby's and my IVF process.\n\nBefore starting IVF, Gabby and I had gone through three miscarriages together.\n\nIVF doesn't always work. Approximately 55% of IVF patients under the age of 35 - Gabby is 26 - have a successful pregnancy after one egg retrieval. We couldn't imagine the pain of telling friends and family that our attempt at having a child had once again failed. So we had agreed we were going to tell as few people as possible about starting IVF.\n\nYet, here I was now, telling my entire class what we were going through and how the Alabama Supreme Court ruling could affect us.\n\nI wasn't alone in sharing our story. The night before my Monday morning class, Gabby published an opinion column on our local news site about the ruling and our resulting fears and anxieties, which really resonated with people.\n\nI was, that day and throughout the next few weeks, fixated on the conceptual gulf between the court's ruling and public opinion. I wondered aloud, \"Who's against IVF? Surely, only 5% to 10% of the public agrees with this ruling.\"\n\nThe actual numbers aren't far off my in-class guess. Only 8% of Americans say that IVF is immoral or should be illegal. But the story is more nuanced than that. Approximately 31% of Americans and 49% of Republicans support \"considering frozen embryos as people and holding those who destroy them legally responsible.\"\n\nIn an attempt to tie our personal political experience into the class topic, I remarked that this court decision was a surefire way to get people involved in politics. I had no clue at the time how prophetic my comment would be.\n\nFleeing to Texas for reproductive rights?\n\nOn Wednesday, Feb. 21, the University of Alabama Birmingham's fertility clinic paused IVF treatments. That wasn't our clinic, but the move sent us into a total panic. Our clinic's closure seemed inevitable - and within 24 hours it had paused IVF treatments as well.\n\nWe didn't know what we were going to do, but we knew we were likely leaving the state to continue IVF. I needed to tell my department chair what was going on.\n\nI was walking out of my department chair's office when my phone rang. Gabby told me, \"We got in, we're going to Temple.\" I ran back into my department chair's office, told her we were going to Temple, Texas, and then rushed home.\n\nA reporter from CNN beat me there. It was one of several interviews with major media outlets Gabby did in the wake of her opinion column. After the interview, we threw clothes in a suitcase, dropped our dogs off at the vet and drove to the Atlanta airport. We flew to Texas that night. https://www.youtube.com/embed/9MCbgW7i2I0?wmode=transparent&start=0 One of the Goidels' many media interviews in the wake of the Alabama ruling.\n\nThe thought of not completing the egg retrieval never seriously entered our minds. We were confident that we could get in with another IVF clinic somewhere, anywhere. But we're affluent. We're privileged. What if we weren't so well off? We wouldn't have wanted to give up, but we wouldn't have been able to afford the fight.\n\nWe spent exactly one week at my parents' house in Texas. Thankfully, my parents live an hour and a half away from the Temple clinic. We met our new doctor, Dr. Gordon Wright Bates, and were immediately reassured. His cool expertise and confidence were calming to a stressed-out couple. The Alabama Supreme Court may have upended our lives, but we felt weirdly lucky to be in such a comfortable place.\n\nThe egg retrieval was Wednesday morning, Feb. 28. By all indications, it went well. IVF, however, is full of uncertainties. Now we are waiting on the results from preimplantation genetic testing. After that, there's implantation and hoping the embryo continues to grow. We're not in the clear: IVF is a stressful process even without a state court getting in the way. But today we are in a situation more like an average couple going through IVF than we have been in the past few weeks.\n\nLate Wednesday night, March 6, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed into law a bill providing legal protection to IVF clinics in the state. Gabby and I rejoiced at the news. Hopefully, we're the last Alabamian couple to flee the state for IVF.\n\nA mobilizing moment\n\nWhen state politics directly interferes with your life, it feels like a gut punch, as if the community that you love is saying you're not loved back. It's easy to see how such an experience could either discourage or motivate you. Research shows that traumatic events, for the most part, depress voter turnout in the following presidential election. By contrast, families and friends of 9/11 victims became and remained more politically engaged than their peers.\n\nIn this case, the Alabama Supreme Court ruling mobilized Gabby and other women going through the IVF process. For better or worse, the women, couples and families mobilized by this decision will likely always be more engaged because of it.\n\n\"Oh, God,\" I remarked to my dad, \"we're going to be activists now, aren't we?\"\n\n\"So?\" he asked.\n\n\"No one likes activists,\" I responded in jest. But if we're going to have and raise the family we want, this is just the first of many decisions we're going to make that someone's not going to like.", "source": {"uri": "physiciansnews.com",

The court's February 16 decision created widespread fear that IVF providers could face criminal charges if they mishandle or destroy an embryo.\n\nConnect with the issues and events that impact your community at home and beyond by subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nDiscarding unused or abandoned embryos is a routine part of the IVF process, and the Alabama court even acknowledged that its ruling would effectively end IVF treatment in Alabama. Several major providers in the state halted IVF treatment in response, leaving LGBTQ+ couples, single people, and those who struggle with fertility issues with dwindling access to the most common method of assisted reproduction.\n\nAs other states across the country also consider legislation that would define embryos and/or fetuses as people, many prospective parents - especially LGBTQ+ people, who disproportionately rely on assisted reproductive technology to have children - are terrified for the future.\n\nWhile fetal personhood bills have largely been used to limit abortion rights in the past, many are now worried that right-wing activists and lawmakers are both actively and unintentionally targeting IVF with such laws because judges could potentially use them to ban the procedure, NBC News explained.\n\nThe SurrogateFirst study found that 50% of same-sex couples said they are \"extremely concerned\" about fetal personhood bills, compared to 41% of heterosexual couples. 67% of same-sex couples also expressed extreme concern that IVF and surrogacy could be negatively impacted by these bills, compared to 29% of heterosexual couples.\n\nSurrogates - whom LGBTQ+ people and especially gay men often rely on to become parents - have also expressed significant worries, with 5% saying they are \"extremely concerned\" that IVF and surrogacy could be negatively impacted by these bills.\n\n68% of intended parents surveyed agreed that fetal personhood laws will have a larger impact on same-sex parents than other parents, with 15% remaining neutral and only 17% disagreeing.\n\n51% of the surrogates surveyed also agreed that fetal personhood bills will have a larger impact on same-sex couples, with only 6% disagreeing and 42% remaining neutral. But a majority of surrogates (68%) also said the bills will not impact their efforts to help start a family and that they are \"determined to help... no matter what hurdles\" they face.\n\nAt the moment, the laws have not had major impacts on surrogates, with 91% reporting they have not encountered new challenges due to any recent laws or bills.\n\nThis is likely because as of now, there are just three states -- Missouri, Alabama, and Georgia -- with laws in effect that grant personhood rights to fertilized embryos. Arizona enacted a law granting these rights as well, but it is currently blocked. However, a dozen states have introduced legislation this year that would legally declare embryos as people, confirming many people's fears about the domino effect the Alabama decision would set in motion.\n\nFurther complicating the matter, many states already have laws regarding reproductive rights, but they don't explicitly consider IVF. Now, lawmakers are reportedly trying to figure out how and if existing state statutes can be interpreted to apply to IVF.\n\nThe national outrage spurred by the Alabama ruling made it clear that Americans on both sides of the aisle (including a significant number who are anti-abortion) overwhelmingly support easy access to IVF and other fertility treatments. This has placed Republicans in a tricky position, as these court decisions directly stem from their successful crusade to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nNow, as lawmakers debate abortion bans and states increasingly grant legal rights to unborn children, the debate has grown over whether embryos count as human beings or personal property that can be used, donated, or destroyed at will. Republicans are now stuck between trying to assure the majority of Americans they support IVF access while also catering to their more extreme far-right backers who want those who want the destruction of embryos to be considered legally murder.\n\nFor example, the Heritage Foundation - a right-wing, anti-LGBTQ+ think tank planning to play a large role in the next GOP presidential administration - recently released a set of preliminary policy recommendations for Congress on regulating in vitro fertilization (IVF). The Heritage Foundation is behind Project 2025, a lengthy set of extreme far-right policy recommendations for the next GOP administration.\n\nBut while many conservative states may be hurdling down Alabama's path, liberal states are doing what they can to protect IVF services.\n\nIn March, Illinois Gov. J.B.

But for many LGBTQ+ couples, this path is far from straight-forward and often riddled with thorns and obstacles, financial ones, in particular. Sperm donors, egg donors, surrogates or gestational carriers don't come cheap, after all.\n\nAs per multiple reports, more and more same-sex couples are turning to treatment options like in vitro fertilisation () over more traditional routes like donor insemination. And, to no one's surprise, they do face immense inequality in the healthcare and insurance systems as well. While this affliction is no doubt affecting queer people worldwide, those in the US have reportedly found it more difficult to receive than heterosexual couples.\n\nFor the unversed, IVF is expensive, to say the least -- and we're talking thousands-of-dollars-expensive. On average, an IVF cost in the US for a single cycle starts from $18,000. The inclusive cost covers 1 IVF + 1 Transfer of own eggs and 1 IVF with an egg donor, which will cost $25,000, roughly over \u20b920 Lakhs! And low success rates of such procedures worldwide make this a fairly huge gamble.\n\nBut all's not lost yet. Recently, Emisil.com ranked various countries globally to shed light on a global landscape of options for looking at IVF in hopes of empowering them to find the right fit for their budget and desired outcomes.\n\nTurns out, for those working with a tight budget, might be the most pocket-friendly option. IVF procedures using donor sperm can be as low as $2,095, making it a prime destination for affordability. With a success rate averaging 40%, this makes it a great option for budget-conscious couples.\n\nFrance offers a sweet spot between affordability and IVF success rates. While costs are double at $4,600, the success rates climb to 60% here. This balance makes it a strong contender, especially in Europe. Another European destination offering a similar balance is Greece. IVF using one's own eggs costs around $3,450, with the success rate being 57.9%. Similarly, Latvia offers affordable donor sperm and moderate success rates, attracting cost-conscious couples seeking positive outcomes.\n\nHowever, for those couples that can take the financial burden, North Cyprus might be the best option. With a staggering 80% success rate, this Turkish destination boasts the highest in the world. While IVF with own eggs cost $3,162.00, the procedure costs around $13,800.00 with donor eggs.\n\nOther great options include Denmark, with its excellent and competitive IUI pricing, and Finland, due to its social healthcare system adding another layer of security.\n\nBut it is important to note that this ranking based on costs is just a starting point, Couples must take into account travel logistics and prioritise consultations with fertility specialists. We wish LGBTQ+ couples luck with finding their right fit for building a family.\n\nTo see the full research and more detailed data please visit this link.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egg donation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sperm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insemination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insemination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Same-sex relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heterosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial insemination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/109952210/india-might-just-be-the-cheapest-option-for-queer-couples-looking-to-have-a-baby-via-ivf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550002", "eventUri": "eng-9550002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

(Getty)\n\nFuture LGBTQ+ parents are \"extremely concerned\" as more USA states are considering implementing foetal personhood bills, according to a new study.\n\nIn the wake of the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade - which has since seen 14 states implementing total abortion bans and seven states placing gestational limits on abortion, according to The New York Times - states have since begun to consider whether embryos should have legal rights.\n\nIn February 2024, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos have the same legal rights as children. This sparked fear among fertility clinics that IVF providers could face criminal charges if they destroyed an embryo - which is a routine part of the IVF process. Biden also responded to the court's decision, calling it \"outrageous\".\n\nSeveral major fertility clinics in the state have stopped providing IVF (in vitro fertilisation) treatment, leaving LGBTQ+ couples, those with fertility issues, and hopeful single parents with little options for reproductive assistance.\n\nIn fact, there are now three states - Missouri, Alabama and Georgia - with laws in effect which grant personhood rights to fertilised embryos. Arizona also enacted such a law, but it is currently blocked.\n\nOther states are now considering similar legislation which would equate embryos and or foetuses as \"people\". This would affect future parents reliant on IVF technology to bring a family into the world, especially LGBTQ+ families - who disproportionately require assisted reproductive services - and are now worried about their future parenthood plans.\n\nA new study by SurrogateFirst found that 50% of same-sex couples said they are \"extremely concerned\" about foetal personhood bills, compared to 41% of heterosexual couples.\n\nMeanwhile, 67% of same-sex couples also expressed extreme worry that IVF and surrogacy could be negatively impacted by such bills, compared to 29% of heterosexual couples.\n\nSurrogates - who are disproportionately relied on by LGBTQ+ people trying to start a family - have also expressed their thoughts, with 5% saying they are \"extremely concerned\" that IVF and surrogacy could be negatively impacted by the proposed bills.\n\nThe majority of surrogates (68%) said that the bills will not impact their willingness to help LGBTQ+ couples and partners facing infertility to bring a family into the world, saying they are \"determined to help...no matter what hurdles\" they encounter.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriella_ferlita@thepinknews.com", "name": "Gabriella Ferlita", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

In America, Some Parents Will Stop at Nothing to Create the Perfect Baby.", "body": "Sex selection with IVF is banned in much of the world. Not in the U.S.\n\nAmy Yin always envisioned having at least two daughters. She spent her 20s working as an engineer and founding a startup in San Francisco. When she wasn't working, vacationing with friends, and spoiling her cats, Amy dedicated herself to helping other women take charge and launch high-powered careers. Now 32, she's bringing that same energy to her family planning. She has frozen her eggs and, when she's ready, will undergo IVF so that she can select the sex of her future children. \"I think I'll raise really powerful women who are going to be rock-star leaders,\" Amy told me, without hesitation.\n\nIn vitro fertilization is invasive, grueling, and expensive. One round costs an average of $20,000. Only 15 states require that insurance plans offer any kind of coverage for it -- and even then, the coverage is usually minimal. The treatment is often a last resort for those who are eager to be parents but who face one roadblock or another when it comes to conceiving; some couples are struggling with fertility issues, some couples are the same sex, and some people are single and making a go of it on their own.\n\nHaving a baby via IVF first requires creating an embryo in a Petri dish. Embryonic testing can reveal secrets like genetic disorders. That allows it to serve as a screening tool for parents who carry genes for rare diseases. Such testing also lets parents know the sex of their prospective children. It essentially allows patients to pick whether they will have a male or female baby. Sex selection was once controversial in the U.S. and is banned in almost every other country. Many Americans unaware of the process still assume that it's that way. In reality, it has now become a standard part of IVF here. For some, the option to sex select is a perk of an otherwise exacting process. For others, it's the whole point of doing IVF in the first place.\n\nOver the past two decades, enterprising clinics have attracted thousands of fertile customers like Amy, who are so invested in selecting their kid's sex that they're willing to undergo weeks of shots, submit to surgery, and risk rare but life-altering complications. Jeffrey Steinberg, the founder of the Fertility Institutes in Los Angeles, figures that elective IVF for sex selection rakes in an estimated $500 million annually for clinics. (He puts it at about 5 percent of the $8 billion market.) But its growth potential is unlimited, Steinberg told me: \"The market is the size of the human race.\"\n\nTwo things are true about America's blazing-hot fertility industry, a sector that is largely unregulated and increasingly owned by private equity firms and hedge funds: It serves a real need -- for many prospective parents, access to these technologies is vital. And yet, it is fueled in part by consumer whims. You can have a baby when it suits your career, thanks to egg freezing (or at least you can try). You can sequence your embryos' genomes for $2,500 a pop and attempt to maximize your future child's health (or intelligence, attractiveness, or height). At Steinberg's clinic, you can even select eye color. There is a vast disparity between who gets to use IVF -- many struggle to access the technology at all because of the cost and, now, political restrictions -- and who is using it to create designer families.\n\nThese patients are seeking not just choice. Many, like Amy, want daughters. The ability to act on that desire -- an option mostly unheard of in the rest of the world -- has sparked a small but growing trend in American family planning. It has expanded the concept of reproductive choice and bodily autonomy to for-profit procedures that will alter future generations. It speaks to a crisis in boys and lopsided expectations for daughters. And even among the people who are opting in, it's creating concerns about the degree of control some parents are attempting to wield over a baby's destiny -- and whether they can ever really exert that control at all.\n\nLexi and her husband, both software engineering managers at major Bay Area tech companies, have always wanted girls. (Lexi asked to be identified by a pseudonym because her parents are unaware of her plans.) Lexi, who is 32, longs to replicate the close relationship she has with her mom; her husband values traits \"more associated with girls,\" including empathy, social skills, and kindness. But they had no plans to act on their preference -- that is, until they learned that their companies would foot the bill.\n\nLexi's husband was more excited than she was: All he needed to do was masturbate into a cup. Lexi's immediate thought was, I don't know if I want to put my body through that in order to guarantee a girl. A fertility work-up suggested that the couple would have no trouble conceiving the old-fashioned way.\n\nStill: Lexi did really, really want a girl. She craved a close friendship with her future child, one that would last into old age. That seemed possible only with a female child. \"I was just like, How do I convince myself to do this\" -- to undergo the discomfort and hassle of IVF -- \"if this is what we want to do for our family?\" she said.\n\nEventually, a double date with fellow techies swayed her. Their friends, too, had no known fertility issues and were creating embryos to select sex and potentially use a gestational surrogate. \"They normalized it,\" Lexi said.\n\nI spoke to 15 women (and a couple of men) who are planning on doing IVF so that they can have a daughter. Being bullish on IVF is not just about sex selecting, several told me. Procedures that appear scary and unnatural to many can feel novel and exciting to science-obsessed computer nerds: IVF can seem \"safer\" than conceiving via intercourse because it's monitored by scientists. \"We spend so much time micro-optimizing so many things in our lives, even micro-optimizing how much time we spend at the grocery store,\" Guthrie Ginzler, Amy's partner and a software product manager, told me. Why not optimize having a baby, from the exact timing of conception to the shape of the chromosomes? Trends spread among hyperconnected peers. I know both Lexi and Amy through my own former career as a software engineer and have met multiple people influenced by their plans.\n\nCase in point: A month after the double date, Lexi was stabbing needles into the fat around her navel, ripening her eggs for extraction.\n\nThree rounds of treatment in, Lexi showed me her IVF spreadsheet. It resembles a software project tracker, except instead of deliverables and deadlines, it documents the amount of eggs that are harvested at each retrieval, the number of fertilized eggs that have developed into healthy blastocysts, and the number of embryos that contain two X chromosomes. (Lexi and her husband want two kids, both girls.)\n\nThey are not stopping at IVF: They have signed with a surrogacy agency and are waiting to get matched with the woman who will carry and birth their elder child, buying them more time to rave, travel, and \"self-actualize\" without worrying about a pregnancy. Their companies will foot $75,000 of the roughly $150,000 surrogacy fee. No one involved in making this happen for them has challenged or even asked about Lexi and her husband's motivations. Lexi described her clinic's attitude as \"This is business as usual, and we get money from you.\"\n\nIt's impossible to pin down how many patients choose IVF purely for sex selection and how many are picking girls; as with most aspects of fertility care, this is something clinics are not required to report. The vast majority of clinics offer the service, with many listing it on their websites. Even when intended parents don't begin fertility treatment intending to sex select, they often discover this option along the way. In fact, several people I spoke to for this story told me that their clinical intake forms asked for the \"preferred gender\" of the child they hoped to have. For many American couples desperate to conceive, the ability to pick feels like a silver lining of a process that is otherwise arduous in terms of both money and emotional health, says Sharon Moayeri, the founder of OC Fertility in Newport Beach, California.\n\nMoayeri's clinic does not prominently advertise sex selection -- it's fourth in a menu of services on the website -- but she estimates that up to 15 percent of patients arrive without any fertility issues. I spoke to a doctor at the medical center at the University of California San Francisco who said their sense was that a low number of patients come in only for sex selection. They did, however, easily point out several examples of parents who, once they're already there, are more likely to request girls: single mothers by choice, same-sex couples, and families with a history of autism. Steinberg, whose Fertility Institutes markets this service aggressively, estimates that 85 percent of patients are there purely for \"gender selection.\"\n\nOld debates around sex selection focused on the wish for sons. Today in America, that preference is often reversed. One study found that white parents picked female embryos 70 percent of the time. (Parents of Indian and Chinese descent were more likely to pick boys.) Anecdotes back this up, with message boards filled with moms dreaming of a \"mini me.\" A 2010 study showed that American adoptive parents were 30 percent more likely to prefer girls than boys and were willing to pay $16,000 more in finalization costs to ensure a daughter. (Agencies have since stopped sharing those costs, after criticism of the differential pricing across gender and race.) Close looks at demographic data suggest that families with daughters tend to have fewer subsequent children than do families with sons, indicating a sense that a daughter is what makes a family complete.\n\nIn fact, according to most of the doctors I spoke with, the majority of parents selecting for daughters already have sons, a situation fertility clinics call \"family balancing.\" Denise, who requested that I use just her first name, works in tech and has four boys who like pink and glitter, will wear nail polish, and enjoy My Little Pony. But Denise still wants a daughter -- a child with whom she can feel an even greater sense of \"relatability.\" Her husband can understand some of her sons' experiences in ways she can't, she explains. She also hopes her husband will treasure the \"precious moments\" possible only between a father and his daughter.\n\nAll the moms I spoke to were looking to add a little estrogen to their brood because they feel they could never have the same connection with a son as they could with a daughter. But some were blunter about their preferences.\n\nGrace, a 31-year-old who works in human resources (I'm referring to her by her middle name), told me, \"When I think about having a child that's a boy, it's almost a repulsion, like, Oh my God, no.\"\n\nGrace and her FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) engineer fianc\u00e9 are freezing embryos to preserve their fertility -- and to ensure they avoid that \"Oh my God, no\" scenario. After she turned 30, her fianc\u00e9 wanted to make embryos right away. Grace wasn't particularly eager to kick off the kid-having process: \"I don't like kids. I don't want kids anytime soon. Especially one that's a boy.\" But she also thinks that her feelings around kids may change -- and she wants to be able to dodge the possibility of becoming a \"boy mom\" if they do. What's so bad about boys? \"Toxic masculinity,\" said many women I spoke to, even those who were, sadly, already boy moms. For many, going through all the trouble to ensure a girl feels like a social good. Amy's partner, Guthrie, believes that because oldest children tend to be more successful, if everyone did sex selection we could squash inequality by manipulating birth order. \"Maybe one of our best chances at trying to destroy the glass ceiling is to have women first,\" said Guthrie. Among the moms I spoke to who already have boys, many want to give their sons sisters to make them into better men. They believe that girls can do anything -- a conviction that often comes with the subtext that boys are incapable of doing their own laundry, calling their moms, expressing empathy, or even really being part of the family as they get older. \"I don't know a guy who has a strong relationship with his mother or his father,\" Grace told me.\n\nThe perception is that boys are trouble -- or at least are susceptible to a particular kind of trouble. There's been a heavily reported-on crisis of masculinity, with men lagging in almost every metric that matters to success-obsessed Silicon Valley. Men are less likely to finish high school, graduate college, and have children. One study found that 60 percent of young men are single, compared with 30 percent of young women, who are more likely to be in a queer relationship.\n\nTo many, the prospect of raising a girl just feels as if it will be easier. She's far less likely to commit a mass shooting or to idolize Andrew Tate. She's also, points out Moayeri, less likely to be diagnosed with autism. Although a man striving to make as much money as possible might feel capitalist and gross, a woman who does the same is a #girlboss -- a beloved trope among millennials making their way in an industry in which only 23 percent of technical roles are filled by women. A daughter, if you squint, can have all of the achievements with none of the baggage.\n\nCould that really be so bad, valuing strong women to the point where you want to make sure you raise one? Many American ethicists argue that sex selection can't be discriminatory if some parents -- even most -- opt for daughters. Further, if mothers are the ones choosing sex, that could be seen as an empowering new form of reproductive autonomy (an argument that becomes more complicated when men are picking too but women are bearing the brunt of IVF). For millennia, sex selection was performed via infanticide. This is not that.\n\nStill, \"the very act of sex selection is sexist,\" argues Arianne Shahvisi, a professor of philosophy at Brighton and Sussex Medical School in the U.K., where elective sex selection is illegal.\n\nYou can't actually foresee your child's gender -- let alone how they will choose to express it or the qualities they will possess as a human being. So sex selection requires making a decision based on stereotypes. In turn, this \"feeds damaging systems of social organization,\" Shahvisi told me, by reinforcing the idea that certain traits are biologically tied to sex -- a view that has, historically, limited women. Selecting for girls might perpetuate negative views of boys and men: If you believe you can create a daughter with whom to have a deep emotional bond, why even try to cultivate that with a son?\n\nIs it unfair to bring a child into the world, assuming she'll fulfill gendered obligations, however positive? The women I spoke to are open to many different gender expressions -- Lexi, Amy, and Grace would all be thrilled to raise a queer, athletic engineer -- but at the end of the day, they expect their daughters to be compassionate, to relate well with their moms, and, once they fly the nest, to FaceTime their parents. They don't expect the same things from sons.\n\n\"Boy children tend to be less caring towards their parents,\" Lexi explained. \"It doesn't really matter if it's socialized or biological. It's probably socialized, but I can't change all of society.\"\n\nIt's not just the U.K. Virtually all the industrialized world -- including Canada, Australia, and every European country besides Cyprus -- bans sex selection except in rare medical cases. Most nations prohibit the practice on the grounds that it promotes sexism and that the children born from it may be harmed by gendered expectations. Widespread preference for a certain sex can also skew the population -- as in India and China, where abortion and infanticide of girls have resulted in tens of millions more men than women. (Amy, who is Chinese American, views her plan to select for girls as a reversal and correction of her culture's historical preference for sons.) In countries where infertility care is covered by insurance or provided by the government, sex selection is also seen as a frivolous waste of taxpayer funds.\n\nIn 1994 the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the nonprofit that provides the industry's professional guidelines, condemned sex selection for nonmedical reasons. Yet with no enforcement power, the guidelines remained just that. Unlike in most peer nations, IVF in America is mostly privately paid and weakly regulated. Instead, market forces dominate. By 2018, despite the ASRM's recommendation that they not offer sex selection, 75 percent of clinics continued to provide the service. Since then, the ASRM's ethics committee has updated its position to a neutral stance.\n\nWhile public sentiment toward sex selection has grown increasingly negative abroad, in the U.S. the ability to select sex is framed as a matter of personal autonomy: just one of many expensive choices that make our country free.\n\nThis particular freedom is big business. The U.S. market for fertility is growing. Clinics are increasingly owned by venture capital; at least 30 percent of fertility services in America are provided by private equity-backed firms, whose priority is maximizing profits. Some thousands of patients a year -- though it's hard to know just how many -- travel to the United States in order to sex select, which could easily account for millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nConvincing parents that it's worth undergoing IVF to have a child of a specific sex is an effective way to increase clinics' customer base beyond the 15 percent of couples of reproductive age who experience infertility. As more tech companies provide IVF benefits, their employees are especially attractive bait. (Grace says she'd never be considering freezing embryos to sex select if her job didn't pay for it.)\n\nBut what can go wrong?\n\nLaura Kerwin, a Harvard-trained psychologist in California, sees many parents like Amy, Lexi, and Grace. In her practice of filthy-rich clients, sex selection is so common as to be unremarkable. She can relate to her patients. She followed all the old wives' tales -- including \"drugging\" her husband with supplements, timing intercourse, and eating acidic foods -- in an attempt to maximize the odds that her third child would be a daughter. She has a message for those patients: Be careful what you wish for.\n\n\"You have this picture in your mind of the family that you want,\" Kerwin said. \"But what do you do if the girl comes out and she doesn't want to be a girl or she isn't the ideal girl that you have in your mind?\" Not only will parents be disappointed, Kerwin cautions, but the children will rebel.\n\nShe has also seen seemingly open-minded parents who -- after investing time, money, and pain into selecting their child's sex -- are devastated after their kid comes out as trans.\n\n\"As a parent, your role is to accept the child you have. Not to mold them into someone that you want them to be: That's narcissism,\" she said. Kerwin did have a daughter -- but her daughter has totally defied her expectations. \"My boys were much sweeter,\" she told me.\n\n\"It's a moneymaking industry,\" she said. \"People need to realize that [clinics] have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to make money. They're trying to sell you on an option.\"\n\nSome of the sex selectors admit that this is all fraught. \"My main concern is that that puts pressure on the child to be a certain way,\" Lexi told me. She reassures herself by saying that she's not choosing specific personality traits or even gender: She and her husband are merely \"weighting the dice.\" One mother, who's doing IVF to give her daughter a sister -- a built-in best friend, she hopes -- told me that the pressure can be crushing. She admitted to feeling as if \"anything that goes wrong is my fault.\"\n\nGrace is aware that her disdain for boys may \"seem dumb or offensive\" to someone who is struggling to conceive, let alone the millions of infertile Americans who can't afford even the most basic fertility care. In fact, all of the prospective girl parents I spoke to expressed enormous empathy for those unable to have a child of either sex; almost everyone agrees that the way IVF is funded in the U.S. is unfair. But in the end, these daughter-desiring patients have the means -- so they're going to use them.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [],

Jeff Landry 'reviewing' IVF protection legislation, along with other bills", "body": "A lab tech uses equipment employed for in vitro fertilization in this undated photo. (Getty Images)\n\nRepublican Gov. Jeff Landry has not said whether he supports a bill aimed at preserving access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment in Louisiana. Landry spokeswoman Kate Kelly said this week he is reviewing the legislation alongside hundreds of other bills still waiting to be passed by the Legislature.\n\nIn March, Landry declined to answer a question from a reporter about whether he agreed with an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that temporarily shut down IVF clinics in that state and sparked national outrage. At the time, he said he was not familiar with the Alabama court's decision, though it had gained significant national attention.\n\nThe Louisiana Legislature looks poised to approve Louisiana's IVF protection legislation, which is a reaction to the Alabama decision. The Louisiana House of Representatives voted 84-16 in favor of the bill last week.\n\n\"IVF has been legal in this state. I am not changing that at all,\" Rep. Paula Davis, R-Baton Rouge, who sponsored the bill, said during the House debate.\n\nIVF is a process that allows people struggling with fertility to have biological children. Embryos are created in a lab outside the womb and then implanted into a person or a surrogate carrying a child on their behalf.\n\nFertility experts warned states with strict abortion bans, such as Louisiana, could leave IVF vulnerable to being outlawed. Embryos can fail or be destroyed during IVF, and some anti-abortion advocates equate embryo disposal to abortion.\n\nDavis said House Bill 833 would insulate doctors, clinics and other health care providers from lawsuits and criminal prosecution in the event that embryos are unintentionally lost. The Alabama Supreme Court almost wiped out IVF services in February when it ruled that frozen embryos were the equivalent of children under state law.\n\nDavis worked with Louisiana's leading anti-abortion organization, Louisiana Right to Life, on her bill to ease its passage. Louisiana already has some of the most stringent limitations on IVF in the country, and Davis agreed not to remove any of them.\n\nUnder current law, viable embryos stored in Louisiana are not allowed to be destroyed, even if their owners don't intend to use them to have more children. People who have embryos also can't sell them; they have to donate them to a married couple.\n\nWhile Louisiana Right to Life agreed to stay neutral on Davis' legislation, Louisiana Family Forum, a conservative Christian lobbying group, opposes the bill.\n\nDuring a short debate in the Louisiana House, state Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, asked why the legislation didn't block IVF clients from moving their embryos outside of the state, where they could be destroyed.\n\nDavis said attorneys believe prohibiting couples from transferring the embryos to another state would be unconstitutional. She didn't include the provision in her bill because of those concerns.\n\nCrews voted against the bill.\n\nThe Louisiana Senate will take up the legislation next. If passed, it will go to Landry's desk. The governor could stop the bill from becoming law by issuing a veto.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Embryo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Crews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raymond Crews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/louisiana_illuminator_articles_680/da52f54ce244582f7ecf2ee905e029de", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550002", "eventUri": "eng-9550002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

I was shocked to learn that patients in Louth are waiting seven months for IVF treatment at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, when the HSE officially aims to have IVF referrals seen within six weeks.\n\n\"It has been confirmed to me by the RCSI Hospital Group that there are currently 78 people in County Louth who are on the waiting list for IVF treatment in the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.\n\n\"The current average waiting time for those County Louth patients is a staggering. At seven months it is putting locals through an agonising wait in an already long, stressful and time-sensitive process.\"\n\nThe Louth Labour TD continued: \"It seems to me, the answer to these unacceptable delays is to work to establish a regional IVF treatment centre for the North-East at the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. If the service is to grow and to meet demand, this is what will need to happen.\n\n\"According to the National Women and Infants Health Programme, within the HSE, patients refer to one of the existing six regional IVF hubs should be seen within six weeks but the wait for Louth patients attending the Rotunda is now an average of seven months.\n\n\"I acknowledge there are a number of private providers of IVF services. The expense involved had put IVF out of the reach of too many. It is clear in the first year of operation that the six public regional hubs are insufficient to cope with the demand for these services.\n\n\"The Lourdes Hospital already has the expertise in obstetrics in place and would in my view be the ideal location to site a seventh regional hub, catering to patients seeking IVF treatment in the North-East.\"\n\nDeputy Nash concluded: \"Access to IVF treatment cannot be allowed to become some kind of post-code lottery and patients from County Louth seeking this life-changing treatment cannot be put at any disadvantage, purely based on their address.\n\n\"I will continue to press the Minister for Health and the HSE on this issue and push for the establishment of a new regional IVF services hub for the North-East at the Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.\"", "source": {"uri": "dundalkdemocrat.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dundalk Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "donard_mccabe@dundalkdemocrat.ie", "name": "Donard McCabe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ged_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ged Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotunda_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rotunda Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachta_D\u00e1la", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teachta D\u00e1la"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "In vitro fertilisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lourdes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lourdes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drogheda"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Drogheda"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Louth", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County Louth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Louth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Service_Executive", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health Service Executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Health_(Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Health (Ireland)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/resizer/1200/700/true/GN4_DAT_15132608.jpg--louth_td_calls_for_new_regional_ivf_hub_at_lourdes_hospital.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550002", "eventUri": "eng-9550002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

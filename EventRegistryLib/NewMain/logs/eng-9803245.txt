But a lot has changed in the last two days following continuous attacks on our leaders and party workers across the country. Now we are going to do whatever it takes to keep our people safe; we are not going to leave them alone.\" \"Awami League is the largest and oldest political party in Bangladesh, so we cannot just walk away from our people. She will definitely return to Bangladesh once democracy is restored,\" he told PTI over the phone.\n\nTerming Awami League an \"all-weather ally of India\", he said India must ensure the security of Awami League leaders in Bangladesh by building international pressure.\n\nJoy also urged the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus, to restore law and order, noting that \"the country is turning into a state of anarchy and becoming a second Afghanistan in the region.\" He said he also expects the interim government to create a level playing field whenever democracy is restored and fresh elections are held.\n\n\"You cannot exclude the Awami League and have a representative democracy in Bangladesh ever. Whatever his (Mohammed Yunus) personal views are, he has said that he wants a government of unity and wants to move forward and not let the mistakes of the past cloud over the future. I hope he stays true to his word,\"he asserted.\n\nProf Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday and was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony in Dhaka.\n\nSheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following violent protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs. She flew to the Hindon air base, near Delhi, in a Bangladesh military aircraft on Monday.\n\nJoy mentioned that once democracy is restored, either the Awami League or BNP will come to power, and the \"Mujib family and Sheikh Hasina will be around.\" \"She has been in touch with all our party leaders for the last two days. My mother was going to retire anytime soon, so we thought now that she is gone, they (rioters) would leave our party people alone, but that did not happen. Instead, they started attacking,\" he said.\n\nDeclining to comment directly on whether he and his sister Saima Wazed, who is currently the South East Asian regional director for the World Health Organization, would enter politics, Joy said he would do whatever it takes to protect Bangladesh from total anarchy.\n\n\"I can't give a definite reply to this question. But I will do whatever it takes to save Bangladesh and protect the Awami League. The Mujib family would not leave them in a lurch,\" said Joy, the former Information and Communication Technology Advisor to Hasina.\n\nBlaming Pakistan for fueling the unrest in Bangladesh, Joy said there is circumstantial evidence suggesting foreign interference and alleged involvement of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.\n\n\"I am quite certain given the circumstantial evidence; I suspect Pakistan ISI's involvement. The attacks and protests were very coordinated, meticulously planned, and intentional efforts to keep inflaming the situation through social media. No matter what the government did to control the situation, they kept trying to worsen it,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that the rioters attacked police with guns which could only be provided by terror outfits and foreign powers.\n\nOn reports of involvement of a US intelligence agency like the CIA, Joy said he had no evidence but added, \"maybe, they are\". He dismissed any Chinese involvement when asked about it.\n\nDismissing reports of Hasina seeking asylum in the UK or any other country as \"rumours\", Joy said the reports of her US Visa being revoked are also untrue.\n\n\"Nothing of this sort has been planned (seeking asylum). Sooner or later, there has to be a restoration of democracy in Bangladesh and hopefully, that will be between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Awami League. Then Sheikh Hasina will be back.\" \"At this point, she wants to go back to Bangladesh. It's a question of when rather than if,\" he said, hinting that the ousted Bangladesh PM will be staying at an undisclosed location in India for now.\n\nJoy, who spent much of his childhood studying in India, appealed to the Indian government to ensure the quick restoration of democracy for stability in the region.\n\n\"I want to thank the Indian government for protecting my mother. I owe my heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Modi. If India wants stability in its eastern backyard, then they have to pressure the international community and take the lead to ensure the quick restoration of democracy,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on the 'INDIA-out' campaign in Bangladesh, he said, \"the anti-India forces are already very active, and with Awami League out of power, the ISI is now free to supply as many weapons as it wants to the anti-India forces.\" Joy said India must act fast before anti-India forces gain more ground.\n\nRefuting claims that Hasina ran away to save her own life, he said the family insisted on stopping the bloodshed.\n\n\"She was not willing to leave the country. The Prime Minister's security was ready to protect her till the end. But that would have led to hundreds of deaths of protestors who were marching towards the PM's residence. We convinced her for the sake of Bangladesh, we cannot let her get killed,\" he said.\n\n\"Our government was not weak, but my mother did not want to harm the students. Even after her leaving the country, the bloodshed has not stopped. The people will now understand the difference with and without Sheikh Hasina,\" he said.\n\nThe death toll in the anti-government protests in Bangladesh climbed to 440 on Wednesday, with the recovery of 29 more bodies of Hasina's Awami League party members across the country through Tuesday, taking the overall death toll to 469 in nearly three weeks since the protests began in July.", "source":

Joy, who has been vocal about the political turmoil following his mother's resignation and departure from Bangladesh, pointed to what he described as circumstantial evidence of foreign interference.\n\nJoy asserted that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency was involved in the unrest. He told PTI, \"I am quite certain given the circumstantial evidence; I suspect Pakistan ISI's involvement. The attacks and protests were very coordinated, meticulously planned, and intentional efforts to keep inflaming the situation through social media.

He emphasized that the Awami League, which his family has long supported, will not abandon its people or leave the party in disarray.\n\nIn his appeal for international intervention, Joy thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for their protection.

Joy had earlier said he had no intention of joining politics.\n\nTalking to TOI over phone from his residence in Washington, DC on Thursday, Joy said, \"I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers.If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum.

We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh.\" Claiming his mother has no plan of seeking asylum in any country, he said, \"For the time being, she is in India.

So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD WHO,\" she wrote on X. In a later post, she wrote, \"To everyone who has shown concern: as much as I would love to see Ma, I don't want to compromise her whereabouts in any way.\"\n\nJoy stressed there was a need for \"introspection\". \"There definitely were mistakes.

We never realized the situation would escalate so fast even after accepting their demands,\" Joy said.\n\nHe also said an alliance of BNP and Jammat will not be able to save the minorities. \"If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure.

Speaking to news agency PTI, Joy claimed that circumstantial evidence suggests foreign interference, specifically pointing to ISI's involvement in the coordinated attacks and protests. According to Joy, the unrest was meticulously planned and exacerbated through social media, to destabilise the situation regardless of the government's efforts to maintain order.\n\nJoy alleged that the rioters used firearms against police forces, weapons that he believes could only be supplied by terror groups and foreign powers.\n\n\"I am quite certain given the circumstantial evidence; I suspect Pakistan ISI's involvement. The attacks and protests were very coordinated, meticulously planned, and intentional efforts to keep inflaming the situation through social media. No matter what the government did to control the situation, they kept trying to worsen it,\" Sajeeb told PTI.\n\nALSO READ: Mohammad Yunus, Bangladesh's Only Nobel Laureate, Sworn In As Interim Govt's Head As Army Eyes Return Of Normalcy\n\nAddressing concerns about his mother's return to Bangladesh, Joy stated that Sheikh Hasina, who is currently in exile, would come back once democracy is restored in the country. However, he mentioned that it has not been decided whether she would return as an active or retired politician. Joy said that the Sheikh Mujib family, which has deep roots in Bangladesh's political history, will not abandon the people or the Awami League, the oldest and largest political party in the country.\n\n\"Yes, it is true that I had said she wouldn't return to Bangladesh.

But a lot has changed in the last two days following continuous attacks on our leaders and party workers across the country. Now we are going to do whatever it takes to keep our people safe; we are not going to leave them alone.\" \"Awami League is the largest and oldest political party in Bangladesh, so we cannot just walk away from our people. She will definitely return to Bangladesh once democracy is restored,\" he told PTI over the phone.\n\nTerming Awami League an \"all-weather ally of India\", he said India must ensure the security of Awami League leaders in Bangladesh by building international pressure.\n\nJoy also urged the interim government, headed by Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus, to restore law and order, noting that \"the country is turning into a state of anarchy and becoming a second Afghanistan in the region.\" He said he also expects the interim government to create a level playing field whenever democracy is restored and fresh elections are held.\n\n\"You cannot exclude the Awami League and have a representative democracy in Bangladesh ever. Whatever his (Mohammed Yunus) personal views are, he has said that he wants a government of unity and wants to move forward and not let the mistakes of the past cloud over the future. I hope he stays true to his word,\"he asserted.\n\nProf Yunus took oath as the head of Bangladesh's interim government on Thursday and was administered the oath of office by President Mohammed Shahabuddin at a ceremony in Dhaka.\n\nSheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country following violent protests against her government over a controversial quota system in jobs. She flew to the Hindon air base, near Delhi, in a Bangladesh military aircraft on Monday.\n\nJoy mentioned that once democracy is restored, either the Awami League or BNP will come to power, and the \"Mujib family and Sheikh Hasina will be around.\" \"She has been in touch with all our party leaders for the last two days. My mother was going to retire anytime soon, so we thought now that she is gone, they (rioters) would leave our party people alone, but that did not happen. Instead, they started attacking,\" he said.\n\nDeclining to comment directly on whether he and his sister Saima Wazed, who is currently the South East Asian regional director for the World Health Organization, would enter politics, Joy said he would do whatever it takes to protect Bangladesh from total anarchy.\n\n\"I can't give a definite reply to this question. But I will do whatever it takes to save Bangladesh and protect the Awami League. The Mujib family would not leave them in a lurch,\" said Joy, the former Information and Communication Technology Advisor to Hasina.\n\nBlaming Pakistan for fueling the unrest in Bangladesh, Joy said there is circumstantial evidence suggesting foreign interference and alleged involvement of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency.\n\n\"I am quite certain given the circumstantial evidence; I suspect Pakistan ISI's involvement. The attacks and protests were very coordinated, meticulously planned, and intentional efforts to keep inflaming the situation through social media. No matter what the government did to control the situation, they kept trying to worsen it,\" he said.\n\nHe also pointed out that the rioters attacked police with guns which could only be provided by terror outfits and foreign powers.\n\nOn reports of involvement of a US intelligence agency like the CIA, Joy said he had no evidence but added, \"maybe, they are\". He dismissed any Chinese involvement when asked about it.\n\nDismissing reports of Hasina seeking asylum in the UK or any other country as \"rumours\", Joy said the reports of her US Visa being revoked are also untrue.\n\n\"Nothing of this sort has been planned (seeking asylum). Sooner or later, there has to be a restoration of democracy in Bangladesh and hopefully, that will be between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Awami League. Then Sheikh Hasina will be back.\" \"At this point, she wants to go back to Bangladesh. It's a question of when rather than if,\" he said, hinting that the ousted Bangladesh PM will be staying at an undisclosed location in India for now.\n\nJoy, who spent much of his childhood studying in India, appealed to the Indian government to ensure the quick restoration of democracy for stability in the region.\n\n\"I want to thank the Indian government for protecting my mother. I owe my heartfelt gratitude to Prime Minister Modi. If India wants stability in its eastern backyard, then they have to pressure the international community and take the lead to ensure the quick restoration of democracy,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on the 'INDIA-out' campaign in Bangladesh, he said, \"the anti-India forces are already very active, and with Awami League out of power, the ISI is now free to supply as many weapons as it wants to the anti-India forces.\" Joy said India must act fast before anti-India forces gain more ground.\n\nRefuting claims that Hasina ran away to save her own life, he said the family insisted on stopping the bloodshed.\n\n\"She was not willing to leave the country. The Prime Minister's security was ready to protect her till the end. But that would have led to hundreds of deaths of protestors who were marching towards the PM's residence. We convinced her for the sake of Bangladesh, we cannot let her get killed,\" he said.\n\n\"Our government was not weak, but my mother did not want to harm the students. Even after her leaving the country, the bloodshed has not stopped. The people will now understand the difference with and without Sheikh Hasina,\" he said.\n\nThe death toll in the anti-government protests in Bangladesh climbed to 440 on Wednesday, with the recovery of 29 more bodies of Hasina's Awami League party members across the country through Tuesday, taking the overall death toll to 469 in nearly three weeks since the protests began in July.\n\n(Except for

Indian media has reported that she plans to seek asylum in Britain, but the British Home Office has declined to comment.\n\nIndia's foreign minister said on Thursday he spoke to his British counterpart about Bangladesh, but did not share any details.\n\nTwo vessels report being attacked off Yemen, UKMTO says Netanyahu's office rails at 'leaks and false briefings' criticizing his handling of hostage talks Israel says top Hezbollah commander killed in airstrike in Beirut suburb", "source": {"uri": "en.apa.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "Azeri - Press Informasiya Agentliyi"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://en.apa.az/storage/news/2024/august/09/resize/66b5a34faef2d66b5a34faef2e172317985566b5a34faef2b66b5a34faef2c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803245", "eventUri": "eng-9803245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother's life at such short notice.\"\n\nSheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister and fled Bangladesh on August 5, when a student-led protest culminated in a mass uprising against her Awami League government.\n\nMore than 400 people were killed in the preceding three weeks, a majority of them in police firing and firing by Awami League activists.\n\nStating that the Awami League leaders were still allegedly under attack in Bangladesh, Joy said, \"I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers. If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term.

The security forces have also become active amid reports of looting at night.\n\nThere have also been attacks on members of the Hindu community, especially outside Dhaka.\n\nJoy's statements came after Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party's acting chairman, is returning to Dhaka following his exile from Bangladesh.\n\nSpeaking right after the new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, \"I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHe also claimed that his mother (Hasina) has no plans for seeking asylum in any country.\n\nJoy stressed there was a need for \"introspection\".\n\n\"There definitely were 'mistakes'. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realised the situation would escalate so fast,\" Joy said.\n\nHe also said an alliance of BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami will not be able to save the minorities. \"If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,\" Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon.\n\nThe Awami League government, during its 15 years in power, and Hasina herself was sharply critical of any political opponent or civil society member calling for foreign pressure in domestic policies.\n\nJoy's comments come after he had earlier in the week said that his family were \"done with politics\".", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tarique Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2022/10/19/sheikh-hasina-pid.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803245", "eventUri": "eng-9803245", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 498, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, some want Hasina back in the country, so much so that they protested for hours creating a huge blockade on the Dhaka-Khulna highway.\n\nThe protests were organised by the former prime minister's party Awami League, its affiliated organisations and activists who demanded the return of Sheikh Hasina.

A certain quarter conspired to oust her from the country by orchestrating a student movement.

Indian media has reported that she plans to seek asylum in Britain, but the British Home Office has declined to comment.\n\n\"Sooner or later, there has to be a restoration of democracy in Bangladesh and hopefully, that will be between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Awami League.

The protests that began in July, initially focused on a controversial quota system for government jobs, quickly transformed into a broader movement against Hasina's administration.\n\nWith the country teetering on the brink of chaos, the figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin moved swiftly to appoint Yunus as the chief adviser of the interim government. The position, equivalent to that of a prime minister, places Yunus at the forefront of efforts to restore peace and stability in a nation deeply divided by recent events.\n\nUpon taking office, Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his pioneering work in microcredit, emphasised the urgent need for calm and unity. \"Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it,\" Yunus declared in his first public address since returning from Paris, where he was attending the Olympics when he was chosen for the role.\n\nYunus's interim Cabinet, composed primarily of civil society members, including two student protest leaders, reflects a deliberate attempt to bridge the divide between the government and its critics.\n\nThis new government faces the monumental task of preparing for credible elections while managing the immediate security concerns that have arisen in the wake of Hasina's resignation.\n\nThe political upheaval in Bangladesh has garnered significant international attention, particularly from neighbouring India, which has historically maintained close ties with Hasina's government.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a statement, extended his best wishes to Yunus and expressed hope for a swift return to normalcy. Modi also highlighted concerns over the safety of minority communities in Bangladesh, specifically Hindus, who have reportedly been targeted during the recent violence.\n\nChina and the United States have also expressed their support for the new interim government. The U.S. State Department emphasised the importance of respecting democratic principles and the rule of law in the coming months, while China reaffirmed its commitment to deepening its strategic partnership with Bangladesh.\n\nThe situation in Bangladesh remains volatile, with reports of continuing violence and looting in the capital, Dhaka. The police force, significantly weakened by the loss of several officers during the protests, has largely withdrawn from active duty, leaving the military to manage security concerns. In response to the growing lawlessness, communities across Dhaka have taken up arms to protect their neighbourhoods, further complicating efforts to restore order.\n\nThe interim government's success will largely depend on its ability to stabilise the situation and gain the trust of a populace that has become increasingly disillusioned with political leaders. Yunus's reputation as a reformer and his commitment to social justice will be crucial in navigating the challenges ahead.\n\nHowever, the shadow of Sheikh Hasina's long tenure looms large, with her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, vowing that the Awami League will continue to play a central role in Bangladesh's political future.\n\nSajeeb Wazed Joy, the son of Sheikh Hasina and a key adviser to his mother, has affirmed that both his family and the Awami League party will continue to play an active role in Bangladesh's political life, despite what he described as recent assaults on the party.\n\nMany political analysts view Joy as the likely successor to his mother, reflecting the dynastic nature of Bangladesh's political culture, where family legacies hold significant sway.\n\nJoy emphasised the importance of the Awami League in shaping the future of the nation, stating, \"If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League. The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHis remarks underscore the party's determination to remain a central force in the country's politics, even as the interim government seeks to navigate the current crisis.", "source": {"uri": "eutoday.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "eutoday.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eutoday_correspondents@eutoday.net", "name": "EUToday Correspondents", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurehead", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Figurehead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://eutoday.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-09-at-09.56.42.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803245", "eventUri": "eng-9803245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

establishment of an interim government of Bangladesh and welcomes this.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Beijing had \"always upheld the principle of not interfering in other countries' internal affairs\" and \"respected the development path independently chosen by the Bangladeshi people.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He further said that it was up to Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus-led interim government to think if they can control the law and order situation in the country.\n\n\"Today Bangladesh looks like Syria or Afghanistan. There is no law and order. After this, it's up to Yunus' government, if they think they can control it. Maybe we will have democracy again.

But, I think there was some group that kept inciting the protesters,\" he said.\n\n\"The situation was escalated deliberately.

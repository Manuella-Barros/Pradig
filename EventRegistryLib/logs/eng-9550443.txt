There have been some mechanical things I've been trying to address and feel like are heading in the right direction, and the coaches feel like are headed in the right direction.\n\n\"I made my swing too flat. It's been a lot of work to try and create better attack angles and a better vertical bat angle.\"\n\nWith Carroll's support and a solo homer from Ketel Marte, Zac Gallen was able to snap a two-game losing streak with six shutout innings.\n\nWith Gallen pitching on Tuesday, it allowed Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo to start left-hander Jordan Montgomery (1-2, 5.63 ERA) on Wednesday.\n\nMontgomery took the loss in his last start, allowing six runs on six hits - including two homers - in three innings against the Los Angeles Dodgers last Wednesday. In four career starts against Cincinnati, Montgomery is 2-1 with a 3.27 ERA with 25 strikeouts and has surrendered just two homers.\n\nCincinnati will look to snap a six-game skid on Wednesday when it sends right-hander Graham Ashcraft (3-1, 3.63 ERA) to the mound.\n\nAshcraft has given the Reds quality starts in his last two outings, including last Wednesday in San Diego when he allowed two unearned runs on five hits over six innings. He took a no-decision as Cincinnati fell 6-2 to the Padres.\n\nReds injuries Christian Encarnacion-Strand out four-to-six weeks; Reds sign Mike Ford\n\nReds Diamondback TJ Friedl TJ Friedl returns, but the Reds' lineup is still looking to get back on track\n\nReds trades Wittenmyer & Williams: Why Cincinnati Reds need to answer Luis Arraez trade quickly\n\nIn his previous start against Texas, he allowed just one run on seven hits over 6 1/3 innings and recorded a no-decision in the Reds' 2-1 loss on April 26.\n\nAshcraft is 1-0 with a 1.42 ERA in two career starts against the Diamondbacks. Last Aug. 27 at Arizona, he allowed two runs on seven hits over 6 2/3 innings in a no-decision.\n\nThe Reds have not held a lead for 42 consecutive innings, dating to last Wednesday in San Diego, when Spencer Steer homered in the first inning. The Reds held that lead until the Padres scored twice in the fourth.\n\n\"For sure, and it's going to happen,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"You want to play with the lead for sure. We've come back in our share of games in the last couple of years. Anything like that could be helpful in taking some of the pressure off. But the pressure is always going to be there.\"\n\nCincinnati's offense has been nearly non-existent over the last two weeks, as the Reds have dropped nine of 11.

There's also an intangible side to a team getting its rhythm back at the plate.\n\n\"This game is what you make of it,\" Reds catcher Luke Maile said. \"Having fun and being a good teammate, that stuff is a choice. We're going to choose to be positive no matter what's going on here. If there's some fun along the way, then that's great.\"\n\nLast April, the Reds got swept in a four-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Reds only scored six runs during that series, and they returned home to Cincinnati with a 7-15 record. It was the low point of the season.\n\nBefore the Reds' next game, Maile gave a speech in a team meeting, stressing that everyone didn't need to feel so much pressure. The Reds went on to sweep the Texas Rangers, who won last year's World Series. Reds center fielder TJ Friedl later called that speech the turning point for the season.\n\nOne speech didn't fix the Reds' offense, but it provided a spark. It also went hand-in-hand with the work that the Reds were putting in behind the scenes.\n\nThis year, the scuffling Reds' offense is going through a similar process as the group tries to get back on track.\n\n\"I don't think there's ever any magic button,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"It's usually just a lot of hard work, consistency and staying with it. Making adjustments is always a part of the game. That's there. Just showing up every day and believing in who we are, you have that confidence to be willing to make adjustments as needed.\"\n\nThe path back to consistency in the Reds' lineup starts some obvious places. Third baseman Jeimer Candelario has to do more damage against fastballs when he gets those hittable pitches. Right fielder Will Benson has to cut down on his strikeouts.\n\nIndia said that he feels like he's having the worst stretch of his career at the plate, and he has to be more aggressive when he gets pitches to hit. Spencer Steer and Jake Fraley need to rediscover the timing that they had at the plate in early April.\n\nThe Reds' struggling hitters are searching for the right adjustments at the plate. The Reds don't have much depth on their bench or in Triple-A that could step into a bigger role and ignite the offense. The Reds' regulars know that it's up to them to turn the season around.\n\n\"There's support, hard work and direct conversations,\" Bell said. \"Everything that needs to be happening. Our players are handling this very well. They're young players. They're doing exactly what needs to be done to get going in the right direction. It may not happen overnight. You just have to stay with it. That's the test.\"\n\nThe Reds believe that there's a science to hitting as well as an art to hitting. Sometimes, the best thing that a hitter can do is break down launch angles, swing paths and exit velocities.\n\nBut the adjustment process doesn't always have to be intense.\n\n\"We're having fun and doing our thing,\" India said. \"We know we have to keep playing well. We have to stay on track. But we can't keep our heads down. We'll keep it loose.\"\n\nThe rally sausage worked for the Twins. But sparks come from different places for different teams.\n\n\"It depends on the kind of team you have,\" Maile said. \"Who your veterans are and how many rookies you have. What your manager's vibe is. There's no right way to do it. One great thing about baseball is that you can't really teach feel. When you have feel, you know what the right answer to that question is.\"\n\nSometimes, a team meeting helps get a slumping lineup on track. Sometimes, it's a player that comes back from the injured list. Friedl returned to the lineup on Tuesday, and he was the prototypical table setter out of the leadoff spot for the Reds in 2023.\n\nSometimes, a team makes a big lineup change to find a spark. Sometimes, a prop gives the entire team something to laugh about and helps the group stay loose.\n\n\"No sausages yet here,\" Maile said. \"We'd lean toward something goetta related, being from this area.\"\n\nThere's a lot that the Reds are still searching for. Wednesday's loss to the Diamondbacks was more of the same.\n\nThe Reds don't have a strong group of right-handed hitters on the team, and Diamondbacks left-handed starter Jordan Montgomery allowed two runs across seven efficient innings. In the bottom of the second inning, Maile, the designated hitter, stranded two runners on base with an inning-ending fly out. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Reds catcher Tyler Stephenson popped out with two outs and two runners in scoring position.Scoring chances were few and far between, just like they've been for the last two weeks.\n\nThe Reds had one more chance in the ninth inning, scoring a run and getting the game-tying run to third base with one out. But right fielder Benson struck out, and India flew out to right field to end the game.\n\n\"It's baseball,\" India said. \"I don't look at it like we're struggling. We're playing against good teams. We're having tough road trips. We're in a grind right now. We'll keep grinding.\"", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Farmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Farmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Maile", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Maile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bell_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Bell (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Friedl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TJ Friedl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/23/PCIN/73420265007-042224-reds-0143.jpg?auto=webp&crop=8002,4501,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550443", "eventUri": "eng-9550443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The 32-year-old slugger was hit by a pitch to start the fourth inning, then stole his first base of the season, but the Diamondbacks couldn't cash him in. He then added a valuable insurance run with a two-out, 390-foot (104.4) solo shot off of Lucas Sims that extended the Diamondbacks' lead to 4-2 -- and proved to be the difference in the ballgame. With his two-hit attack, Su\u00e1rez is now hitting .226/.295/.346 with three long balls and 20 RBI on the season.\n\nDe La Cruz strikes out twice in loss to D-Backs\n\nElly De La Cruz went 0-for-4 with a pair of strikeouts in Wednesday's loss to the Diamondbacks -- and still managed to steal a pair of bases. The 22-year-old phenom reached base on a fielder's choice in the fifth inning, then proceeded to steal second and third base before being stranded there. He has been an invaluable asset in fantasy leagues so far this season, slashing .254/.356/.516 with eight homers, 19 RBI and a league-leading 21 stolen bases (in 24 attempts).\n\nDiamondbacks vs. Reds MLB Betting Trends\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 6 of Arizona's last 8 games against Cincinnati\n\nOver/Under has gone UNDER in 4 of Cincinnati's last 5 games\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 9 of Arizona's last 12 games\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 5 of Cincinnati's last 6 games at home\n\nDiamondbacks vs. Reds MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake Arizona.

The Reds, now 16-21 on the season, are only a half-game out of last place in the National League Central.\n\nThursday represented progress for the Reds in one respect: it marked the first time in May, and the first time overall since the night the losing streak began on April 30, that they scored more than three runs. Even with that (relative) offensive eruption, the Reds have been outscored 17-43 during this spiral. They've scored one run or fewer in three of their eight consecutive losses.\n\nPredictably, the Reds' offense stacks up as one of the worst in baseball this season. They rank 27th in wRC+ -- a park-adjusted catch-all stat hosted at FanGraphs -- as well as 20th in home runs and 17th in runs scored. (The Reds, of course, are still playing half their games at a hitter's park.)

Second baseman Matt McLain underwent shoulder surgery in March, and third baseman Noelvi Marte was suspended for 80 games after testing positive for a banned substance. The Reds also lost infielder Christian Encarnacion-Strand to a broken wrist this week, though he had underperformed in 29 games to date.\n\nCincinnati's offensive futility has overshadowed a quality rotation. Every member of the Reds current starting five -- Hunter Greene, Nick Lodolo, Andrew Abbott, Frankie Montas, and Graham Ashcraft -- had an ERA+ of 110 or better through their first five-plus starts this season.

Find out more in my MLB picks ahead.\n\nMy best bet\n\nDiamondbacks moneyline (-110 at bet365)\n\nMy analysis\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds haven't been an awful team this year, at least not based on their raw numbers. Cincinnati is about average in both runs scored and runs allowed, averaging 4.40 per game in both categories. That's the profile of a mediocre team that should be hanging around .500 all year long.\n\nBut recently, the Cincinnati lineup has gone ice cold. Over their last five games, the Reds have scored a total of just six runs. They've also allowed an average of 5.6 runs during that period -- part of a six-game losing streak that has dropped them to fourth place in the NL Central.\n\nCincinnati might think it has a chance to break out tonight against Jordan Montgomery. The 31-year-old has struggled over his first three starts of the year, allowing 10 runs on 17 hits over just 16 innings of work.\n\nBut those numbers are likely skewed by a small sample size in which Montgomery has allowed an uncharacteristic three home runs. In recent seasons, Montgomery has consistently allowed less than one homer per nine innings. He's also struck out around eight batters per nine innings, a number that's down to 4.5 per nine this season.\n\nGiven how little Montgomery has pitched this year, I'm counting more on his career numbers than what we've seen so far in 2024. Meanwhile, the Arizona Diamondbacks offense is humming. After a recent downturn, the D-backs have put up 17 runs over their last two games -- more in line with their Top 5 mark in baseball.\n\nWhat's more impressive is they've been that good without the help of perhaps their biggest weapon, defending NL Rookie of the Year, Corbin Carroll. The 23-year-old is hitting just .211 with two homers on the season but has broken out this week, going 5-for-13 with a homer and seven RBI over his last three games. If Carroll is back to his 2023 form, this lineup will be tough for anyone to deal with.\n\nWhile Graham Ashcraft (3-1, 3.63 ERA) is off to a solid start in 2024, he's not the kind of frontline starter that can expect to slow down an explosive Diamondbacks lineup.\n\nThe Diamondbacks should win tonight's game, and while these offenses are both potent, the pitching matchup is too solid to justify an extremely high total. I'll take the Under at 9.5 runs.\n\nI'll also take young Arizona star Corbin Carroll to pick up at least one hit today. While Carroll has struggled so far this season, he has hit in three straight games, picking up five knocks during that time.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbin_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corbin Carroll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/28861a65-30d4-43d3-ad7e-edb5b36ced33.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550443", "eventUri": "eng-9550443", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 61, "textEnd": 66}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Most recently, Arizona found themselves in the midst of a three-game losing streak before they finally broke back into the win column with an 11-4 victory over the San Diego Padres. Arizona also earned a 6-3 win over Cincinnati in the first game of this mid-week series. Getting the start will be lefty Jordan Montgomery who is 1-2 with a 5.62 ERA on the young season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reds will attempt to defend their home diamond after getting swept by the Baltimore Orioles. In ugly fashion, the Reds have been defeated in six consecutive outings and are now three games under .500 at 16-19. Tasked with saving the day will end up being righty Graham Ashcraft who is 3-1 with a 3.62 ERA in six total starts.\n\nIt hasn't been the start the Arizona organization or its fans dreamed of, but the talent that exists on this roster is more than evident.\n\nAt first glance, the outcome of this game and the possibility that the Diamondbacks could cover the spread may end up falling on the shoulders of pitcher Jordan Montgomery. When first arriving to the scene several months ago, many believed that Montgomery was the perfect piece to an Arizona starting pitching staff that needed some depth. Even though the former New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals hurler is off to a rocky start as a member of the Diamondbacks, his early season struggles shouldn't be expected to last forever. After getting shellacked by the ultra-talented Los Angeles Dodgers for six earned runs, don't be alarmed if Montgomery is due for a solid outing.\n\nIn addition to the team having scored the fifth-most runs in baseball and looking extremely formidable with the bats, the Diamondbacks will also be looking to improve their record when slated as favorites at -117 or more. Currently, the Arizona Moneyline is at -122. With a 50% win rate when this occurs, the D-Backs will surely want to improve in this sense.\n\nWhy The Reds Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nIt has been a struggle to say the least if you are the Cincinnati Reds. Luckily, this isn't the NFL where only 17 games played. In fact, with more than five months remaining in the regular season, the Reds should have plenty of time to get the ball rolling before it is too late. Regardless, as the month of May has progressed, the worse Cincy has gotten, and the team will no doubt want to rid themselves of their losing ways as soon as possible.\n\nDespite a 2-8 record in their last ten, the Reds offense has hit a lull. Slashing only 4.3 runs per contest when at home, Cincinnati's scuffles at home are a head-scratcher, and it may be up to Graham Ashcraft to reverse this disturbing trend. The 26-year-old got off to a slow start to the season, but he has picked up the pace as of late. In his previous two starts, he has given up one single run spanning more than 13 innings pitched. Call me crazy, but if the Reds are going to make a return to their winning ways, then a masterful performance on the mound could be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nIf all else fails, perhaps star shortstop Elly De La Cruz can break out of his mini-slump at the plate. Woefully, De La Cruz is only raking .245 in his previous 15 games. Luckily, he does sport a .822 OPS which could be come into play in this one if the young superstar can barrel one up from inside the batter's box. For Cincy's case, an outburst from a scary hitter might get the job done to get back to the win column. If not, it may be the Reds who might be staring at the face of defeat yet again.\n\nFinal Diamondbacks-Reds Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Diamondbacks looked not to be messed with in the 6-3 win over the Reds, and a similar outing may be in the cards in this one.

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nCarroll hits three-run home run in win\n\nCorbin Carroll went 2-for-5 with a three-run home run and five RBI in a win over the Reds on Tuesday. This was a much-needed big game for Carroll, who is still slashing just .211/.300/.278 on the season with two home runs and 12 RBI. The home run was well-struck at 104.3 mph off the bat and traveling 390 feet. While that's great, it was the only ball on the day that Carroll hit over 87 mph. It doesn't make sense to trade Carroll away while his value is so low, but we'll need to see more consistent quality contact before we can be sure he's fully healthy or ready for a hot stretch. However, it is nice to see him back to hitting leadoff, which would be important for his fantasy value.\n\nStephenson hits solo home run in loss\n\nTyler Stephenson went 1-for-4 with a solo home run in a loss to the Diamondbacks on Tuesday. Stephenson took Paul Sewald deep 399 feet at 101.2 mph off the bat for his fourth home run of the season. He also had a 101.6 mph flyout and a 96.4 mph flyout on the day. Despite slashing just .213/.318/.413 on the season, Stephenson is posting an 18.5 percent barrel rate and a career-high 13 percent walk rate. He's being far more patient at the plate and is swinging and missing less than he ever has. It's possible he's being too patient, but the quality of contact has been strong and he could be due for a hot streak very soon.\n\nDiamondbacks are 4-1 SU in their last 5 games against Cincinnati\n\nReds are 1-5 SU in their last 6 games at home\n\nDiamondbacks are 14-6 SU in their last 20 games against an opponent in the National League Central Division\n\nDiamondbacks vs. Reds MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake the under.

On Tuesday, the second baseman hammered his second home run of the season.\n\nIn the audience at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati were India's wife Daniella, and their three-month-old daughter, Adalina. Proud of seeing India hit his second home run of the season, Daniella took to Instagram stories to issue the praise:\n\n\"Late for the game but right in time for daddy's homer.\"\n\nThe Reds were trailing the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-1 when Jonathan India hit a 406-foot home run in the bottom of the seventh inning. Despite the fact that the Reds went on to lose 6-2, Daniella was still proud of her husband's contribution, despite being late to the game.\n\nA native of Fort Lauderdale, India has been dating Daniella Garcia since 2019. Born to Venezuelan parents, Daniella attended Florida Atlantic University before transferring to Santa Fe College in Gainesville, Florida.\n\nThe winner of the 2021 Rookie of the Year Award, the first month of the 2024 season was not quite easy on India. Through the first month of the season, the 27-year-old hit just .213 with a single home run and eight RBIs.\n\nDespite some musings that India might be a valuable trade piece last season, the Cincinnati Reds eventually decided to keep the infielder around. This offseason, Jonathan India inked a two-year extension worth $8.8 million, which will keep him around until the end of the 2025 season.\n\n\"The Reds are on the board courtesy of a solo home run from Jonathan India!\" - Bally Sports Cincinnati\n\nDespite being touted as one of the league's most young and exciting teams, the Reds have struggled. Now 2-8 over their last 10 games, Cincinnati's 16-19 record on the season places them fourth in the NL Central, five games behind the leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nJonathan India's manager knows player's capabilities\n\nDespite the sluggish start to the season, Reds manager David Bell has been a devoted fan of India since he made his Reds debut. In spring training, Bell lauded the second baseman:\n\n\"He's still a young player, and he's done so much for us. He's had such a good start to his career. He's been an everyday player for us\"\n\nStill relatively early in his career, India is learning that slumps are not permanent.

They had the same 16-21 record at the 37-game mark a year ago before going on a four-month surge that put them in contention for a playoff spot.\n\nBut even that start didn't include an eight-game losing streak.\n\nOnly twice in franchise history have the Reds made the playoffs after a season in which they had an eight-game losing streak.\n\nOn the bright side, they went to the World Series both of those years, in 1990 and 1961.\n\nOn the other hand, heads up Friday. No Reds team has ever lost nine in a row and gone on to make the playoffs.\n\nDid somebody say heads up?\n\nFor the added life the lineup showed Thursday compared to recent weeks, they ran themselves out of multiple scoring chances.\n\nThat included Elly De La Cruz leading off the sixth with a walk, stealing second and then getting picked off as he broke for third as Logan Allen whirled to second.\n\nIt looked especially costly when Spencer Steer followed with a walk, followed by a Jake Fraley single. The Reds didn't score in the inning.\n\nAfter producing their first inning of more than a run this month -- rallying to tie in the seventh on a De La Cruz RBI single and two-run single by Steer -- the Reds had speedy pinch-runner Stuart Fairchild on first with one out in the eighth, trailing by a run.\n\nBut he lost track of Jeimer Candelario's fly to center as he slid into second on a steal attempt and was easily thrown out at first for the inning-ending double play.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Allen_(baseball,_born_1997)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logan Allen (baseball, born 1997)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Fairchild", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Fairchild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Fraley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Fraley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeimer_Candelario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeimer Candelario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_runner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch runner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/09/PCIN/73632309007-050924-reds-vs-diamondbacks-2.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6642,3736,x0,y346&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550443", "eventUri": "eng-9550443", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Cincinnati Reds outfield prospect impresses for High-A Dayton Dragons", "body": "The Cincinnati Reds are taking an aggressive approach toward a lost art in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds promoted right-handed pitching prospect Rhett Lowder to Double-A Chattanooga after the 2023 first-round draft pick made just five starts for the High-A Dayton Dragons.\n\nReds outfield prospect Jay Allen II might not be far behind Lowder on the way to Chattanooga. Allen hit just .154 with 40 strikeouts in 105 plate appearances for Dayton during an injury-plagued 2023 season, but he's hit .387 with six home runs and an OPS of 1.194 through his first 77 plate appearances of this season for the Dragons.\n\nAllen was a first-round pick of the Cincinnati Reds in the 2021 MLB draft.\n\nThe Reds selected Allen 30th overall, with a compensatory pick they received after losing free agent Trevor Bauer. Allen's signing bonus was $2,397,500.\n\nThe Reds selected infielder Matt McLain earlier in the first round (17th overall).\n\nChase Petty, selected 26th overall by the Minnesota Twins in that draft, was traded to the Reds in the Sonny Gray deal in 2022. Petty is pitching this season for Chattanooga.\n\nThe Reds drafted pitcher Andrew Abbott in the second round in 2021.\n\nAllen starred in baseball, football, and basketball at John Carroll Catholic High School in Fort Pierce, Florida.\n\nAllen, like Petty, had committed to play baseball for the Florida Gators. Allen batted .357 in 28 games during his senior year of high school.\n\nA star quarterback who threw 29 touchdown passes as a senior at John Carroll, he had offers to play football at Air Force, Coastal Carolina, East Tennessee State, Eastern Kentucky, FIU, Florida A&M, Florida Atlantic, Georgia Southern, Georgia State, Grambling State, Marshall and Youngstown State.\n\nAllen also scored more than 1,000 points in basketball.\n\n\"(Baseball) was the safest choice for my body,\" Allen told milb.com. \"I felt I could really be something if I applied my full-time effort into just baseball without the wear and tear of getting hurt in football.\"\n\nAllen ranks 25th among MLB Pipeline's top Reds prospects.\n\nFrom Allen's MLB Pipeline profile:\n\n\"Allen's plus speed makes him a legitimate basestealing threat and he can cover a ton of ground in center field. The goal is to try and keep the right-handed-hitting outfielder on the field for an entire season to see if he can start moving towards his very high ceiling.\"\n\nWith the Dragons in 2022, Jay broke the all-time Dayton franchise record for most stolen bases in a single game with five.\n\nAllen turns 22 in November.\n\n\"I'm big on thinking,\" Allen told The Enquirer's Charlie Goldsmith in 2022. \"This game is very hard, and that's really attractive. It's not (only) physical, it's mental. The way we run with this as hitters, that gives me a little more confidence and gets me excited to do this.\"", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"},

That happens throughout the season. You've still got to go out there and figure it out and keep the team in it. It's just one of those days.\"\n\nIt's been a lot of those days for the Reds, who lost all six games of this homestand.\n\n\"It's all my responsibility now,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"It's a player's game for sure, but that's my job and we're all working hard and it's a team effort. We came up short today.\"\n\nThe Reds have come up shorter than Eddie Gaedel recently. The numbers on the scoreboard haven't been pretty, but they aren't the only ugly numbers during the season and especially during the six-game winless stretch at home.\n\n0 wins: Most importantly, the Reds didn't collect a win in six games at home, where they are now 9-13. The team is now 16-21 overall, the same record it had after 37 games last season.\n\n.172 batting average: The Reds managed just 32 hits over those six defeats and 18 came in the last two games. The Reds managed just 11 hits in three games against the Orioles, despite missing the Orioles' top two pitchers, Corbin Burnes and Kyle Bradish. The Reds are batting .211 for the season.\n\n.225 average with runners in scoring position: That mark was actually better than the team's overall average, but still not good. The Reds are hitting .262/.338/.423 on the season with runners in scoring position, so the bigger problem has been getting runners on second and third.\n\n1 lead: The Reds led just once the entire homestand, taking a 1-0 load in the bottom of the second inning of Wednesday's loss to the Diamondbacks on a Stuart Fairchild RBI single. It was the team's first lead in 43 innings. Fairchild was thrown out at second trying to stretch his single into a double and the next two batters singled, which would've likely resulted in another run. Instead, the Diamondbacks answered in the top of the third with a Gabriel Moreno single and Pavin Smith double to tie the game. Graham Ashcroft would then walk in a run later in the inning. The Reds didn't lead Thursday but did tie it twice, each time falling behind the next inning.\n\n3 runs against opponents' starters: The Reds didn't score a run against any of the opponents' starters until the penultimate game of the homestand when they put up two runs against Arizona's Jordan Montgomery. The third came Thursday off of Arizona's Slade Cecconi on a Jeimer Candelario solo homer. Opponents' starters put up a 0.72 ERA over the six games.\n\n3.19 ERA from Reds starters: In a flip-flop from last season, the Reds have gotten good starting pitching and poor hitting. Reds starters have a 3.77 ERA on the season, the sixth-best mark in the National League. Last year the Reds finished with a 5.49 ERA, only better than Colorado in the NL.\n\n5 runs by former Reds: Tucker Barnhart, Eugenio Su\u00e1rez and Kevin Newman, now all members of the Diamondbacks, went 6-for-24 (.250) with five runs, two RBIs and a home run in the three-game series. Barnhart scored three of those runs.\n\n5 1/2 games behind in the National League Central: Not that anyone is looking for silver linings at this point, but it's important to remember the Reds play in the National League Central, far from the most grueling of divisions. After Thursday's loss, the Reds were 5 1/2 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago Cubs. Cincinnati entered its homestand 3 1/2 games behind Milwaukee and 2 1/2 games behind Chicago. The Brewers play the Cardinals on Thursday evening.\n\n6 hits for Jeimer Candelario: Hey, it wasn't all bad. Candelario, who has struggled in his first season with the Reds, saw his average go from .194 starting the series to .216. He had three hits Wednesday and another two Thursday, including his third homer of the season and his second at Great American Ball Park.\n\n10-game road trip: The Reds left for San Francisco following Thursday's game. They'll play three against the Giants before heading to Arizona for three games against the Diamondbacks and then to Los Angeles for four games against the Dodgers.\n\n11 runs scored in six games: That number matches how many runs the Orioles scored against the Reds on Sunday. Of the Reds' 11 runs at home, all but two came in the three-game games against Arizona. The Reds still average 4.35 runs per game, near the league average of 4.36 runs per game before Thursday's games.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_trent_rosecrans@theathletic.com", "name": "C.

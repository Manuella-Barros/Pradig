{"id": 231440516, "title": "US Declaration of Independence document bore arms of English king", "text": "It is a founding document of the United States and inspired the Declaration of Independence and the purge of English power from the American colonies. But, ironically, George Mason\u2019s seminal Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 was written on paper watermarked with the arms of the king of England, a British expert has discovered. As one of the most significant documents in American history, the Virginia declaration is held in a secure vault at the Library of Congress (LoC) in Washington, DC. Dr Ian Christie-Miller, a former visiting research fellow at London University and a specialist in paper analysis, has discovered a watermark that shows the Hanover crown and the emblem of King George III, under whose rule the American colonies were lost. He told the Observer: \u201cThe value of watermark research has been widely known but ignored for years. The evidence has been sitting there unnoticed until now.\u201d Christie-Miller made the discovery while researching his forthcoming philosophy book, Conscience \u2013 The Restoration. \u201cIt is ironic that paper bearing the arms of the king was used by George Mason for his first draft declaration, which was to lead to the overthrow of English power in the American colonies. Apparently he had few qualms of conscience in using that watermarked paper.\u201d The US war of independence led to Britain\u2019s 13 American colonies throwing off British rule to establish the sovereign United States of America. British attempts to impose unpopular taxes had contributed to growing tensions between the Crown and colonists, who resorted to armed rebellion. The king opposed their bid for independence, although he was not directly responsible for policies such as the Stamp Act of 1765, which was passed by the British parliament. Mason drafted his call for American independence from Britain in 1776. It was amended by Thomas Ludwell Lee, and the Virginia Convention and Thomas Jefferson drew heavily on it for the Declaration of Independence. Dr Peter Thompson, associate professor of American history at Oxford University, said: \u201cThe paper may have had to be compliant with the Stamp Act \u2013 which deepens the irony. \u201cI wonder, if Mason had had a choice and there had been some alternative supply of paper, whether he would still have chosen stamped paper, so as to make a point of complying with the law, even though he didn\u2019t agree with it.\u201d The LoC catalogue description notes: \u201cThis uniquely influential document was also used by James Madison in drawing up the Bill of Rights, 1789, and the Marquis de Lafayette in drafting the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, 1789.\u201d Mason wrote: \u201cAll men are born equally free and independant [sic], and have certain inherent natural rights \u2026 among which are the Enjoyment of Life and Liberty, with the Means of acquiring and possessing Property, and pursueing [sic] and obtaining Happiness and Safety.\u201d These beliefs did not extend to enslaved people, however, as Mason owned more than 100 enslaved people at the time, despite condemning slavery as \u201cdisgraceful to mankind\u201d. The LoC said: \u201cWe\u2019re always happy to help scholars with their research, but \u2026 we can\u2019t comment on their finished work.\u201d", "summary": "<p>UK expert discovers George III watermark on paper used as 1776 founding document, which is kept in secure vault</p><p>It is a founding document of the United States and inspired the Declaration of Independence and the purge of English power from the American colonies.</p><p>But, ironically, George Mason\u2019s seminal Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 was written on paper watermarked with the arms of the king of England, a&nbsp;British expert has discovered.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/08/us-declaration-of-independence-document-bore-arms-of-english-king\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/08/us-declaration-of-independence-document-bore-arms-of-english-king", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232aac2662ac5de7befaa59635e4fe1700c00fda/0_141_1178_707/master/1178.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVm", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:49", "author": "Dalya Alberge", "authors": ["Dalya Alberge"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.101}

Ferrari\u2019s Monegasque driver was finally able to convert pole position into race success on the familiar streets of the sunny Principality at the third of asking, having previously failed to do so in high-profile fashion in both 2021 and 2022. Leclerc led for the entirety of Sunday\u2019s race in Monte Carlo, getting an initial great start from McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri before then keeping his position at the front for the whole way following a restart that followed a lengthy delay caused by a massive first-lap crash involving Red Bull\u2019s Sergio Perez and the Haas duo of Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hulkenberg. All three cars were eliminated as the Red Bull sustained extremely heavy damage to leave debris strewn all over the track, with no further action taken by the race stewards following a long stoppage as crucial repairs were carried out to the safety barrier. A dramatic first lap also saw Esteban Ocon collide with Alpine team-mate Pierre Gasly during a risky move at Turn Eight, with Ocon subsequently offering an apology on social media as he incurred the wrath of team boss Bruno Famin. Ocon was also ruled out of the race with damage inflicted when his car was raised into the air and landed heavily back down on the track, meaning he could not serve a 10-second time penalty handed down by the stewards. Instead, his punishment for causing the incident was commuted to next month\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, where the Frenchman will face a five-place grid penalty instead.

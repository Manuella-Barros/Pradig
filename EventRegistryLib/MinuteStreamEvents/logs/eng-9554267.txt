According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Dupree \"has been talking\" with the Steelers along with one of his other former teams, the Atlanta Falcons. Schefter also notes Dupree just wrapped up a visit with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe 22nd overall pick of the 2015 NFL Draft, Dupree spent six years in Pittsburgh. Injuries slowed the start of his career but he broke out in 2019, registering 11.5 sacks. He was having a strong 2020 season before tearing his ACL late in the year, ending the year with eight sacks. A free agent the following offseason, he signed a long-term deal with the Tennessee Titans. But his productivity was muted, recording seven sacks over two seasons, and the team released him after 2022.\n\nDupree, now 31, signed with the Falcons for the 2023 season, starting 16 games and bouncing back with a respectable 6.5 sacks. If he returned to Pittsburgh, he would split defensive snaps with Nick Herbig, coming off his promising year. Last year, Herbig and Markus Golden split snaps. Golden's contract expires and he remains a free agent while the team claimed Jeremiah Moon off waivers early in the offseason.\n\nRelated Items:Adam Schefter, Bud Dupree, Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending Recommended for you Jerome Bettis: Russell Wilson Is 'Going To Be Special' For Steelers CBS Sports: Steelers' Trade For Justin Fields A Move That Will 'Pay Off The Least' From NFL Offseason Roman Wilson Receives Invite To NFLPA Rookie Premiere", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Dupree", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bud Dupree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bettis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Bettis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waivers_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waivers (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/StockBudDupree2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554267", "eventUri": "eng-9554267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

One of those players is former first-round pick Bud Dupree, who recently met with the Chargers and has also been talking with the Falcons and Steelers, according to ESPN.\n\nDupree, 31, spent the 2024 season with the Falcons, where he recorded his most productive campaign since 2020, his final season with the Steelers, who selected him with the 22nd overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft. Dupree had 6.5 sacks, 39 tackles and a pair of forced fumbles last season.\n\nBud Dupree ATL * OLB * #48 View Profile\n\nDupree would likely be a backup in either Pittsburgh or Los Angeles. The Steelers' outside linebacker spots are currently manned by perennial All-Pro T.J. Watt and Alex Highsmith. Eight-time Pro Bowler Khalil Mack and four-time Pro Bowler Joey Bosa are the Chargers' starting outside linebackers.\n\nDupree could possibly start in Atlanta, though. The Falcons' projected starting outside linebackers are Arnold Ebiketie and Lorenzo Carter, who combined to record nine sacks and three forced fumbles last season while playing with Dupree. Atlanta did spend a third-round pick on former Washington outside linebacker Bralen Trice, who had 18 sacks during his final two years with the Huskies.\n\nA former standout at Kentucky, Dupree's NFL career started slowly. He started in just nine games during his first two seasons before becoming a full-time starter in 2016. Dupree's breakout season took place in 2019, when he tallied a career-high 11.5 sacks while helping Pittsburgh boast the league's fifth-best scoring defense.\n\nDupree (who played six seasons in Pittsburgh after the Steelers franchise-tagged him after picking up his fifth-year option for the 2019 season) enjoyed a solid start to the 2020 season before he suffered a season-ending knee injury after 11 games. What followed was an underwhelming two-year stint with the Titans, who during the 2021 offseason signed him to a massive five-year deal.\n\nLast season, though, showed that Dupree may be back to where he was prior to injuring his knee, which might be why he is generating interest on the open market.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_deardo@cbssports.com", "name": "Bryan DeArdo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Dupree", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bud Dupree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Highsmith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Highsmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Carter_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Carter (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Mack", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalil Mack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

Dupree is a veteran player with strong stats who still offers value on the field. The Chargers, Steelers, and Falcons are seen as top contenders for Dupree.\n\nWith NFL training camps only a couple of months away, free agent Bud Dupree is trying to decide on his new team soon.\n\nPer ESPN's Adam Schefter, Dupree recently held a visit with the Los Angeles Chargers, but he has two more visits already lined up with two of his former teams, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Dupree reconciles with one of his old teams or if he finds a better fit with the up-and-coming Chargers.\n\nDupree has been in the league since 2015, when he was drafted in the first round by the Steelers. He has been a solid edge rusher and a strong veteran in the league for several years now.\n\nA move for Dupree may benefit the Chargers due to the youth on the team and the injury history of their top edge rusher, Joey Bosa. A veteran addition along the defensive front would also make sense in terms of new head coach Jim Harbaugh's stated desire to have other teams \"fear\" the Chargers in 2024.\n\nThe Falcons and Steelers would also benefit from Dupree's presence on the field, so this decision probably will come down to who values him more as a player.\n\nRelated Report: Two-Time Super Bowl Champ & Former Chiefs WR Visiting With Chargers Marquez Valdes-Scantling is set to visit with the Los Angeles Chargers this afternoon, and he could be the veteran presence L.A. needs right now. Bud Dupree's Career He still has a lot of game left in him\n\nOf Bud Dupree's nine seasons in the NFL, six have been spent with the Steelers, two with the Tennessee Titans, and last season with the Falcons. As he enters his 10th year, he is only 31 years old and still has a lot of gas left.\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Key Stat: In the 2019 season, Bud Dupree was one of just four players, along with his Steelers teammate T.J. Watt, to post 11+ sacks and 4+ forced fumbles.\n\nIn 2023, he played and started 16 of 17 games for the Falcons, had two forced fumbles, three passes defended, 6.5 sacks, and 39 combined tackles. He is still productive and would be a good signing for a team that needs a veteran's experience and presence on the field.\n\nBud Dupree's Career Statistics\n\nCategory\n\nDupree\n\nInterceptions\n\n1\n\nPasses Defended\n\n15\n\nForced Fumbles\n\n12\n\nFumble Recoveries\n\n4\n\nSacks\n\n53\n\nCombined Tackles\n\n305\n\nTackles for Loss\n\n70\n\nQuarterback Hits\n\n90\n\nNumber 48 has had his longest tenure with the Steelers from 2015 to 2020 and arguably his best year by far was 2019. He has been productive since then, but not as effective as was expected coming out of his breakout 2019 season, when Dupree recorded a career-high 11.5 sacks.\n\nDupree will still have an impact on the field wherever he goes, so he should be scooped up whether sooner rather than later whether that be by the Chargers, Steelers, or Falcons.\n\nBased on last year, the Steelers as well as the Chargers had pretty weak defenses who struggled, giving up over 340 yards on average to offenses each game. The Chargers tried to address their defense in the NFL Draft, selecting four defensive players in rounds three to five. The Steelers also drafted three defensive players, but a little later in the draft, comparatively.\n\nDefensive Average Yards Per Game\n\nTeam\n\n2023\n\nFalcons\n\n321.1\n\nSteelers\n\n342.1\n\nChargers\n\n362.9\n\nOn the other hand, the Falcons, who had Bud Dupree last season, had a pretty strong defense, giving up around 320 yards on average per game, which ranked 11th overall compared to the Steelers at 21 and the Chargers at 28.\n\nOf course, this difference is not completely due to Dupree, but it does show that the Steelers and Chargers might have a greater need for an edge rusher like Dupree.\n\nSource: Adam Schefter\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro-Football Reference unless otherwise stated.\n\nRelated NFL Power Rankings: Ranking All 32 Teams Following the NFL Draft An in-depth look at all 32 teams coming out of the 2024 NFL Draft.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Dupree", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bud Dupree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_rusher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edge rusher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

The team has recently met with former Pittsburgh Steelers standout defender Bud Dupree, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nDupree was originally selected by the Steelers at No. 22 overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of the University of Kentucky. He was with Pittsburgh from 2015-20, providing the Steelers with a hard-hitting defensive anchor for years.\n\nHowever, injuries took their toll and the Steelers decided to cut ties.

Dupree is the program's 13th coach all-time.\n\nDupree played 16 seasons in the WNBA as the sixth overall pick in the 2006 draft out of Temple. She played for Chicago, Phoenix, Indiana, Seattle and Atlanta in her career. Dupree then took part in the NBA's assistant coach program before working with San Antonio as a player development assistant.\n\n\"It is an honor to be entrusted with upholding the tradition and legacy of TSU while embracing the evolving landscape of sports,\" Dupree said in a statement.\n\nWith the Spurs, Dupree started as an assistant guest coach during the 2022 summer league. She was hired as player development coach two months later. She worked with the NBA's youngest roster to start this season, a group led by NBA rookie of the year Victor Wembanyama.\n\nAllen said Tennessee State is excited to have Dupree set the stage for unprecedented success.\n\n\"Her legendary playing career and success as an NBA assistant coach in player development bring unmatched expertise to our women's basketball program,\" Allen said.\n\nDupree still ranks third all-time in WNBA history with 2,842 made field goals, fifth with 494 games played and fifth in career points with 6,895. She won a WNBA title in 2014 with Phoenix Mercury.\n\nShe takes over a program that went 11-19 this past season.\n\n___\n\nAP women's college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candice_Dupree", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Candice Dupree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_State_University", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee State University"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WNBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WNBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletic director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84b5dbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3102x1745+0+162/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff4%2F9a%2F3580b587bc12e3ea7ca9b7d3cf60%2Fcdb5825211fb44bc951b7eea76d0d5d6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554267", "eventUri": "eng-9554267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452990449, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 13, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 13}}}

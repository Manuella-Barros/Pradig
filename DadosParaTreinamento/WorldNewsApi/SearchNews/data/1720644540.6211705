A prominent example of their solid friendship occurred in 2012 when Beyonc\u00e9 wrote Michelle Obama a touching letter expressing her appreciation and thanks. Beyonc\u00e9 complimented Michelle in the letter, calling her a \"truly strong African American woman\" and a role model. She emphasized the good impact Michelle has on young women globally as well as on her daughter Blue Ivy. \"Michelle, thank you for every single thing that you do for us. I am proud to have my daughter grow up in a world where she has people like you to look up to.\" The beautiful letter was handwritten and signed by the Renaissance superstar. As their relationship deepened over time, Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband Jay-Z hosted a fundraiser in 2012 in support of Michelle's husband President Barack Obama's reelection campaign. The event, which also raised a substantial amount of money, was because Queen Bey loved the Obamas, as she said at the event, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how proud we are to host tonight\u2019s event with President Obama....

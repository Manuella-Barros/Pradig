The Whites missed out on automatic promotion last weekend, but they have a second bite of the promotion cherry through the play-offs.\n\nTheir semi-final first leg will be played at Carrow Road on Sunday afternoon and Leeds will be keen to get the upper hand in the tie before welcoming the Canaries to Elland Road next Thursday. The play-off final will be played at Wembley Stadium, of course, and should Leeds progress they would face either Southampton or West Bromwich Albion in a winner takes all clash.\n\nLeeds will be focused firmly on this Sunday's clash, though, and as the build-up gets underway, the Yorkshire Evening Post rounds up some of the latest news.\n\nEx-Arsenal midfielder Adrian Clarke admits the manner in which Leeds United brought an end to their regular season is a concern going into the play-offs. The Whites lost their final two games of the campaign with a heavy loss at QPR being followed by a defeat at home to Southampton.\n\nAs such, they were pipped to a spot in the top two by Ipswich Town and Clarke thinks Leeds might struggle to bounce back this weekend in East Anglia. The pundit is still tipping Leeds to progress from the tie to the final, but he believes the Whites may have to get the job done next week on home soil.\n\n\"It's a worry really that they lost meekly at home to Southampton in the way they did,\" Clarke told the 'What The EFL?!' podcast. So I'd almost make Norwich favourites for the first leg but over the two I'd still just about side with Leeds United. Wouldn't surprise me if this is quite cagey.\"\n\nHe added: \"I wouldn't fancy Norwich to win the second leg,\"\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest Leeds United headlines, with the free Yorkshire Evening News - Leeds United newsletter. \"Their away record is pretty poor anyway. They didn't put up much of a fight at Birmingham on the last day and they've lost a lot of matches to some pretty average teams away from Carrow Road this season.\"\n\nNorwich City are encouraging their supporters to wear yellow on Sunday afternoon as they look to claim the upper hand in the play-off semi-final tie. Carrow Road will be packed to the rafters this weekend and with the weather forecast being kind at present, the club are urging fans to wear the club's colours and create 'a sea of yellow in the stands'.\n\nTo build the atmosphere, the Canaries will also have live music playing outside the ground, while home fans will have discounted food and drink available. With the team bus arriving at the ground at around 10.30am, with fans expected to gather and give David Wagner and his squad a supportive welcome.\n\nNorwich fan and TV personality Jake Humphrey has echoed that message on social media. He wrote: \"I'd love the fans to recreate what Ipswich did for the team bus arrival ahead of the derby at Portman Road. Really make the players feel it.

While West Brom signed off the regular season with a comfortable victory over Preston in front of their home supporters.\n\nHaving been in contention for an automatic promotion spot for much of the campaign, the disappointment of missing out cannot linger for Farke's side. In recent years, it is very rare to see the side who finish third get themselves into the Premier League through the play-offs.\n\nLeeds have shown throughout the term they have the ability to buck not only that trend, but their own play-off history. The Whites enter their sixth campaign in the knockout phase, having previously failed in their last five attempts at this stage, the latest of which coming at the hands of Derby County in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "leeds-live.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "leedslive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_king@leeds-live.co.uk", "name": "Oliver King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Farke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Farke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elland_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elland Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norwich City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens Park Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coventry City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_City_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hull City A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middlesbrough F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blackburn Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preston North End F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_County_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derby County F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bromwich Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Martin_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Martin (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/article29113543.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2150827689.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552989", "eventUri": "eng-9552989", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Daniel Farke's side have won already this season in East Anglia, and have not lost away to the Canaries since April 2018.\n\nLeeds are expected to welcome both Patrick Bamford and Daniel James back into the fold for the fixture this weekend. But can United further bolster their squad for the tie with players out on loan from LS11?\n\nThe short answer is no. The Yorkshire club currently have 10 players plying their trade away from the football club across Europe and in the Football League.\n\nREAD MORE: 49ers future Leeds United transfer plan mapped out amid Will Ferrell's new investment\n\nREAD MORE: Leeds United's ghosts of the past could haunt Daniel Farke if own warning is ignored\n\nJack Harrison, Maximillian Wober, Brendan Aaaronson, Rasmus Kristensen, Marc Roca and Diego Llorente, are just a few of the names whose seasons are yet to conclude this term. Sam Greenwood, Luke Ayling, Cody Drameh and Ian Poveda's Championship stints at Middlesbrough, Birmingham City and Sheffield Wednesday respectively, finished following the final day last weekend and will now return to Elland Road.\n\nHowever, those four players will be unable to compete in the final part of Leeds' season. A change in the loan regulations back in the 2017/18 season ended the loaning of players up to specific dates and introduced a new system whereby loans were extended up to the start of the next player registration window.\n\nThe EFL's player registration regulations state: \"A Player whose Standard Loan expires (or terminates) at the end of the Season of the Transferee Club but prior to the completion of the League Matches of his Transferor Club (where it is a Member Club) will not be eligible to play in any remaining League Matches for the Transferor Club in that Season. Examples where this may apply are (a) differential season ends for different divisions or (b) a player finishing a loan and his 'parent club' has qualified for the play-off competitions.\"\n\nSo even though Ayling, Greenwood, Drameh and Poveda's seasons are finished, they will only be able to watch the action unfold from the stands. But, it is a different situation for defender, Joe Rodon.\n\nThe Welsh international arrived from Tottenham Hotspur on season-long loan at the start of the campaign. Given that Leeds' term is yet to conclude, the 26-year-old is still eligible to feature for the Whites ahead of their trip to Norwich, hoping to add to the 18 clean sheets he kept during the league

It doesn't matter. Leeds have lost in the playoffs before, but it was a completely different group. I wasn't in charge, so it doesn't matter. Obviously we're here to change it. That's the reason why I'm here.\"\n\nA more pertinent concern to Farke is the way his Leeds team fell off a cliff after doing so well in 2024. They were unbeaten this year in the Championship until April 6 and had come like the winner in the Grand National, storming to the front, before their form vanished over the last six games.\n\nMarcelo Bielsa failed in the playoffs with Leeds\n\nThey lost four games, winning just once, and suddenly all the momentum generated by Farke disappeared. Worryingly, they lost their last two matches at the once-impregnable Elland Road to Blackburn and Southampton.\n\nThose remain the only two home defeats Leeds have suffered this season and Elland Road's forbidding aura has gone. Yes, Farke did his best to talk up their third place and 90 points, but this is not the sort of form to take into the playoffs. They are all about momentum and basically Leeds have none.\n\nInjuries have not helped and they have lost Dan James and Patrick Bamford at critical times.\n\nLeeds have beaten Norwich home and away this season and they head to Carrow Road on Sunday, having not lost in East Anglia since April 2018. But are Leeds the same team who defeated David Wagner's side or are they still damaged?\n\nThey have proved this season they can win big-pressure games and they beat the top two Leicester and Ipswich home and away. That's one crumb of comfort as for Farke and Leeds - and they're going to need it.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Whites missed out on automatic promotion over the course of the 46-game regular season and they must now emerge victorious in the dreaded play-offs if they are to play Premier League football next season.\n\nThey'll take on Norwich City in the first leg of their semi-final on Sunday, with a return leg at Elland Road due to be played next week, in the hope of reaching the play-off final at Wembley Stadium. If they get there, Leeds will be pitched against the winner of the other semi-final between Southampton and West Bromwich Albion in a winner takes all clash for the right to play in the top flight.\n\nThe Premier League is wealthiest league in the world and just playing in it can be extremely lucrative, with steep increases in revenue coming from all angles. As such, Leeds are determined to bounce back to the top flight at the first time of asking after last year's relegation and bring in the cash needed to re-establish themselves among English football's elite.\n\nUnited's owners 49ers Enterprises are highly ambitious and they will have plans for both the club and Elland Road that depend on being promoted. But, how much money may actually be riding on the play-off final, which will be played at Wembley Stadium on May 26.\n\nWell, in 2020, a Deloitte report suggested that the winner of the play-off final will stand to pick up between \u00a3135 million and \u00a3265m, depending on whether or not the team can survive and avoid relegation in its first season in the top flight.\n\nThat season, the figures published on the Premier League's official channels showed a broadcast revenue total of more than \u00a32.5 billion was distributed among the club's competing in the division. Of that, all 20 clubs received an equal share payment of \u00a331.4m, an international TV payment of \u00a347.5m and a central commercial sum of \u00a35.9m.\n\nGet a personalised Leeds United news round-up, as well as breaking news, when you sign up for our free Leeds United newsletter email.\n\nThat works out at around \u00a384.8m before merit payments and facility fees are taken into account. Merit payments, based on the final table, last season ranged from \u00a33.1m to \u00a362.3m, with each Premier League place being worth \u00a33.1m. That's not to mention the facility fees on top, which are thought to be just over \u00a31m a game.\n\nParachute payments paid to those who fall out of the top flight, something Leeds have been benefitting from this season, are also added to the total, with 55 per cent of the equal share of broadcast revenue paid in the first year after relegation. That drops to 45 per cent in year two and 20 per cent in year three, should the relegated club have been in the top flight for more than one season.\n\nOf course, the figures differ year on year and with a new Premier League TV deal to come into effect from the 2025-26 season said to be worth \u00a36.7bn over four years, being in the top flight looks set to become even more lucrative.", "source": {"uri": "yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yorkshire Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_jackson@yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk", "name": "Will Jackson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leeds"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elland_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elland Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Bromwich Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_EFL_Championship_play-off_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 EFL Championship play-off final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norwich City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/jpim-static/image/2024/05/06/11/34/GettyImages-1493941950.jpg.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552989", "eventUri": "eng-9552989", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1483, "textEnd": 1489}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

will be available for free.\n\nDuring his season-long loan with Birmingham City, he was unable to stop the Midlands team's relegation to League One.\n\nLeeds are expected to experience a busy summer

City and Ipswich Town in the race for automatic promotion to the Premier League, Leeds will have to contest the play-offs.\n\nWest Brom and Southampton take part in the other semifinal which means the Whites have a lot of work to do to make it to the Premier League again.\n\nAfter leaving Fulham in 2020, Drameh joined Leeds United and has since appeared in ten first-team games for the Yorkshire club.\n\nWhen Cardiff City made an offer in 2021, he was given the go-ahead to go out on loan for the first time.\n\nHe played 22 games for the Bluebirds to advance his career before returning to his parent club.\n\nAfter joining Luton Town in January 2022, the former England youth international assisted Rob Edwards' team as they were promoted to the Premier League.\n\nThen came the Birmingham City adventure for the player but his time at St. Andrews ended up being a failure as the club was relegated to the third tier of English football.\n\nDrameh still has a long way to go as he is young

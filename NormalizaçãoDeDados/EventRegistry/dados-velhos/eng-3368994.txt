Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsDiluting whiskey with water may enhance its flavorWater pushes alcohol and taste molecules up to the top of your glass\n\n(CNN)If anyone has suggested adding a little water to your whiskey, you may want to give it a try. Rather than watering it down, the addition may act as a flavor enhancement, and we now know the science behind it, thanks to a new study.\n\nThe combination is a bit counterintuitive, which is part of the reason researchers wanted to look at the molecular chemistry behind what's happening in your whiskey glass.On the surface, whiskey seems simple: It's mostly barley malt and water that goes through a specific process. But from a chemistry standpoint, whiskey includes a complex variety of molecules that contribute to its unique taste. One of those is the compound guaiacol, which lends itself to the smokiness associated with some whiskeys. Guaiacol is the molecule that two researchers from the Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry in Sweden focused on for their study, published Thursday in the journal Nature. The researchers looked at both bottled and cask-strength whiskey. Bottled whiskey has been diluted to about 40% alcohol by volume, down from 70% after distilling. Cask whiskey is stronger, at about 55% to 65% alcohol by volume, even if some alcohol evaporates as it matures in barrels for at least three years. Read MoreWhat they discovered is that guaiacol is most present at the surface of diluted whiskey, which is why whiskey with added water tastes better: The taste molecules are at the top of your glass.\"From a molecular perspective, water and alcohol don't completely mix,\" co-author Ran Friedman wrote in an email. \"Instead, we have clusters of water molecules and clusters of alcohol molecules. When whisky is diluted, the alcohol is driven to the surface, and many of the taste molecules follow it because they like to be in a slightly less aqueous environment. The taste that we experience is therefore enhanced -- but there's a limit. If we dilute the whisky too much the concentration of the taste compounds is reduced and the drink will be meager.\"In higher-alcohol whiskey, the flavor is different because the taste molecules aren't reacting to the presence of water.\"The most interesting finding was that at high alcohol by volume concentrations -- 59% and up, cask-strength whisky -- the taste compound was surrounded by ethanol molecules in the solution,\" Friedman wrote.Friedman and colleague Bjorn Karlsson didn't discover this through taste, although both like whiskey, but by using computer simulations of the molecules. \"They enable us to follow on chemical processes as if we're watching a molecular movie. We usually work on problems that have something to do with biology or human health, but at some point got interested in understanding why dilution affects the taste of whisky,\" Friedman said. The researchers believe their findings can be applied to other aged spirits, like brandy, rum and tequila, because they have similar solutions, taste compounds and alcohol by volume. Though they didn't drink any whiskey during the study, the two researchers enjoy traditional Swedish snaps (what we might call schnapps), ice-cold and undiluted.\"We believe that the principles we describe are true for a long list of taste compounds,\" Friedman said. \"In that case, one can find an optimal alcohol content for a spirit to taste best for many drinkers. The conclusions may also apply for the food industry, as some extracts that are used in the industry are stored in diluted alcohol solutions.\" Whiskey expert: 'Feel the Kentucky hug'When it comes to whiskey and how best to enjoy it, it can be a very personal choice. As a mixologist at the Bar at Husk Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, Rod Weaver likes to offer a pour of bourbon or rye whiskey in two ways: neat and over ice. \"This approach allows the drinker to compare the two; one room temp, and the other throughout the natural dilution as the ice melts over time,\" Weaver wrote in an email. \"There will be considerable change as it 'opens up.' This can also happen with oxidation.\"But as a whiskey lover, he recommends becoming acquainted with the type of whiskey \"just the way the maker intended\" before changing it in any way, whether it's \"a 10-year plus, non-chill filtered, barrel-proof 'Haz-Mat' (over 140 proof) face-melting monster, or a 6-month-young local and grainy infant\" whiskey.He believes that Scots were most likely the first to dilute their whiskey in the glass, while blenders and distillers of whiskey decide how much to dilute their products individually.\"But the best way to taste bourbon is hot, straight out the bottle,\" Weaver said. \"Chew it around your mouth, swallow, and feel the Kentucky hug.\"LeNell Smothers, owner of LeNell's Ltd. in Brooklyn, tells people to drink whiskey however they like it best. She isn't one to say there's a \"proper\" way to drink. She also sells her own brand of whiskey called Red Hook Rye, and includes a formula for how to add water to reduce proof in the packaging of her barrels. The formula comes from Chuck Cowdery's book \"Bourbon, Straight.\"\"Divide the proof you have by the proof you want and subtract one,\" Smothers wrote in an email. \"Multiply that number by the amount of whiskey you want to dilute and the result will be the amount of water to add. For example, to reduce 2 ounces of 135 proof whiskey to 100 proof, divide 135 by 100 and subtract one. Multiply that number by 2 ounces. You add 0.7 ounces water to 2 ounces Red Hook Rye to make it 100 proof.\"The only time I do highly recommend adding water is when drinking a cask-strength whiskey, a whiskey that has been bottled straight from the barrel to the bottle without addition of water,\" Smothers said. \"Those high proofs are fine for a sip to taste the power of the spirit; however, if you drink barrel-proof whiskeys, the strength could damage the lining of your esophagus, besides the fact you may end up with a nasty hangover.\"", "id": "9697037", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why whiskey tastes better with a little water", "image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170816140209-whiskey-file-super-tease.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "198", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196346", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Red Hook"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "218332", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hook,_Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Red Hook"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "242093", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Food"}, "id": "303078", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Biology"}, "id": "303493", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glass"}, "id": "303772", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook Messenger"}, "id": "308970", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Redox"}, "id": "310565", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barrel"}, "id": "310652", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt"}, "id": "316533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rye"}, "id": "317098", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye"}, {"label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}, "id": "319869", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rum"}, "id": "320365", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bourbon whiskey"}, "id": "322662", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 274, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 275, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1504, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic"}], "time": "13:26:00"}

Bottled whiskey has been diluted to about 40% alcohol by volume, down from 70% after distilling. Cask whiskey is stronger, at about 55% to 65% alcohol by volume, even if some alcohol evaporates as it matures in barrels for at least three years.\n\nWhat they discovered is that guaiacol is most present at the surface of diluted whiskey, which is why whiskey with added water tastes better: The taste molecules are at the top of your glass.\n\n\"From a molecular perspective, water and alcohol don't completely mix,\" co-author Ran Friedman wrote in an email. \"Instead, we have clusters of water molecules and clusters of alcohol molecules. When whisky is diluted, the alcohol is driven to the surface, and many of the taste molecules follow it because they like to be in a slightly less aqueous environment. The taste that we experience is therefore enhanced -- but there's a limit. If we dilute the whisky too much the concentration of the taste compounds is reduced and the drink will be meager.\"\n\nIn higher-alcohol whiskey, the flavor is different because the taste molecules aren't reacting to the presence of water.\n\n\"The most interesting finding was that at high alcohol by volume concentrations -- 59% and up, cask-strength whisky -- the taste compound was surrounded by ethanol molecules in the solution,\" Friedman wrote.\n\nFriedman and colleague Bjorn Karlsson didn't discover this through taste, although both like whiskey, but by using computer simulations of the molecules.\n\n\"They enable us to follow on chemical processes as if we're watching a molecular movie. We usually work on problems that have something to do with biology or human health, but at some point got interested in understanding why dilution affects the taste of whisky,\" Friedman said.\n\nThe researchers believe their findings can be applied to other aged spirits, like brandy, rum and tequila, because they have similar solutions, taste compounds and alcohol by volume.\n\nThough they didn't drink any whiskey during the study, the two researchers enjoy traditional Swedish snaps (what we might call schnapps), ice-cold and undiluted.\n\n\"We believe that the principles we describe are true for a long list of taste compounds,\" Friedman said. \"In that case, one can find an optimal alcohol content for a spirit to taste best for many drinkers. The conclusions may also apply for the food industry, as some extracts that are used in the industry are stored in diluted alcohol solutions.\"\n\nWhiskey expert: 'Feel the Kentucky hug'\n\nWhen it comes to whiskey and how best to enjoy it, it can be a very personal choice.\n\nAs a mixologist at the Bar at Husk Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, Rod Weaver likes to offer a pour of bourbon or rye whiskey in two ways: neat and over ice.\n\n\"This approach allows the drinker to compare the two; one room temp, and the other throughout the natural dilution as the ice melts over time,\" Weaver wrote in an email. \"There will be considerable change as it 'opens up.' This can also happen with oxidation.\"\n\nBut as a whiskey lover, he recommends becoming acquainted with the type of whiskey \"just the way the maker intended\" before changing it in any way, whether it's \"a 10-year plus, non-chill filtered, barrel-proof 'Haz-Mat' (over 140 proof) face-melting monster, or a 6-month-young local and grainy infant\" whiskey.\n\nHe believes that Scots were most likely the first to dilute their whiskey in the glass, while blenders and distillers of whiskey decide how much to dilute their products individually.\n\n\"But the best way to taste bourbon is hot, straight out the bottle,\" Weaver said. \"Chew it around your mouth, swallow, and feel the Kentucky hug.\"\n\nLeNell Smothers, owner of LeNell's Ltd. in Brooklyn, tells people to drink whiskey however they like it best. She isn't one to say there's a \"proper\" way to drink.\n\nShe also sells her own brand of whiskey called Red Hook Rye, and includes a formula for how to add water to reduce proof in the packaging of her barrels. The formula comes from Chuck Cowdery's book \"Bourbon, Straight.\"\n\n\"Divide the proof you have by the proof you want and subtract one,\" Smothers wrote in an email. \"Multiply that number by the amount of whiskey you want to dilute and the result will be the amount of water to add. For example, to reduce 2 ounces of 135 proof whiskey to 100 proof, divide 135 by 100 and subtract one. Multiply that number by 2 ounces. You add 0.7 ounces water to 2 ounces Red Hook Rye to make it 100 proof.\n\n\"The only time I do highly recommend adding water is when drinking a cask-strength whiskey, a whiskey that has been bottled straight from the barrel to the bottle without addition of water,\" Smothers said. \"Those high proofs are fine for a sip to taste the power of the spirit; however, if you drink barrel-proof whiskeys, the strength could damage the lining of your esophagus, besides the fact you may end up with a nasty hangover.\"", "id": "9696957", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why whiskey tastes better with a little water", "image": "http://gantdaily.com/images/gant-og-logo.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "198", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196346", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "label": {"eng": "Charleston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216991", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Red Hook"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "218332", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hook,_Brooklyn", "label": {"eng": "Red Hook"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "242093", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Email"}, "id": "302685", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Food"}, "id": "303078", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Biology"}, "id": "303493", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glass"}, "id": "303772", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Redox"}, "id": "310565", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barrel"}, "id": "310652", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt"}, "id": "316533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rye"}, "id": "317098", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye"}, {"label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}, "id": "319869", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rum"}, "id": "320365", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bourbon whiskey"}, "id": "322662", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distilled beverage"}, "id": "324694", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 274, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 275, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1504, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic"}], "time": "13:26:00"}

And guaiacol molecules tend to bind to alcohol molecules, says Bjorn Karlsson, a computational chemist from Linnaeus University who co-wrote the paper. Both kinds of molecules are partially repelled by water.\n\nThe researchers found that in their simulations at lower alcohol concentrations, the taste-creating molecules and the alcohol molecules would cluster on the surface of the glass near the air.\n\nBut at higher alcohol concentrations, the molecules associated with taste will spread out through the glass. \"When you increase concentration of ethanol, ethanol will sort of be totally at the interface [between the liquid and the air], fill up the total space at the interface and then start to also be found in the bulk\" of the glass, Karlsson says. \"And then a lot of the taste compounds will then be transferred from the interface into the bulk.\"\n\nThe researchers think the position of these taste molecules in the glass has a big impact on the smell and taste of the Scotch whisky.\n\nIf the molecules are right on the surface, as they are in lower concentrations, \"the first thing that you will experience on the tongue is what's on the interface.\" The compounds are also more likely to actually come off the surface as a gas, increasing the drink's aroma.\n\nKarlsson says this helps to explain why whiskey is diluted before bottling.

A couple of chemists in Sweden set out to figure out why adding a little water would improve the drink's taste.\n\nThey say the taste improvement happens because alcohol molecules and those that determine whiskey's taste tend to stick together. Their findings were published today in Scientific Reports.\n\nFirst, the scientists developed computer model simulations that strip whiskey down to its most basic elements: water and ethanol, or alcohol.\n\nThey then simulated how the molecules interacted at different concentrations with guaiacol, a molecule common in single-malt Scotch whiskies that gives them a smoky taste.\n\nWater and alcohol don't uniformly mix together. And guaiacol molecules tend to bind to alcohol molecules, says Bjorn Karlsson, a computational chemist from Linnaeus University who co-wrote the paper. Both kinds of molecules are partially repelled by water.\n\nThe researchers found that in their simulations at lower alcohol concentrations, the taste-creating molecules and the alcohol molecules would cluster on the surface of the glass near the air.\n\nBut at higher alcohol concentrations, the molecules associated with taste will spread out through the glass. \"When you increase concentration of ethanol, ethanol will sort of be totally at the interface [between the liquid and the air], fill up the total space at the interface and then start to also be found in the bulk\" of the glass, Karlsson says. \"And then a lot of the taste compounds will then be transferred from the interface into the bulk.\"\n\nThe researchers think the position of these taste molecules in the glass has a big impact on the smell and taste of the Scotch whisky.\n\nIf the molecules are right on the surface, as they are in lower concentrations, \"the first thing that you will experience on the tongue is what's on the interface.\" The compounds are also more likely to actually come off the surface as a gas, increasing the drink's aroma.\n\nKarlsson says this helps to explain why whiskey is diluted before bottling. Straight out of the cask, it might be up to 65 percent alcohol by volume, though it is typically then diluted to about 40 percent before bottling.\n\nAdding a few drops of water would therefore continue to increase the concentration of guaiacol molecules at the surface, potentially improving the taste.\n\nHow much water should you add? People \"want to know what the recipe is, how much water you should actually get to get the best taste out of it,\" Karlsson says.\n\nAnd that's not something he claims to have. Even though their research points to a reason why taste might be improved through dilution, they provide no guidelines for how much water to add. People's whiskey preferences are personal, and it's \"very hard to say something in general,\" he says.\n\nAnd whiskey is \"among the most complicated products there is in terms of chemical composition,\" the chemist adds. \"So we have selected one component as a model for one group out of many groups found in whiskey.\"\n\nThat component -- the one that produces a smoky flavor in single malt Scotch -- has chemical similarities with other molecules used to flavor whiskies, like vanillin. Karlsson says \"it's a fairly high probability that they would behave the same.\"\n\nBut probably don't use a heavy hand watering down your whiskey in order to improve its taste. Even though whiskey preferences are personal, Karlsson does suggest that there could be a chemical reason to avoid putting too much water into your whiskey.\n\n\"We have receptors on our tongue, in our nose, that are sensitive and depend upon the concentration of the specific components you want to detect with your nose and tongue,\" he says. \"So if it's too diluted there's a risk that you actually don't detect it with your nose or your tongue.\"\n\nGood luck figuring out the balance that tastes best to you!", "id": "9698364", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Chemists Say You Should Add A Little Water To Your Whiskey.

Inspired by the smooth, smoky flavor, they vow to investigate a question whiskey enthusiasts answered decades ago: Does adding water to whiskey really make it taste better?\n\nThat's the almost true story behind a paper published this week in the journal Scientific Reports. Bjorn Karlsson and Ran Friedman of the Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry are not whiskey drinkers, but Friedman did visit Scotland, and he raised an eyebrow at the locals' dedication to watering down even the fanciest Scotch.\n\nLike a good scientist, he wanted to test the assumption, so he teamed up with Karlsson and used computer simulations to model the molecular composition of whiskey.\n\nThere are two competing theories for why adding water to whiskey might improve the flavor, Karlsson said. The first suggests that adding water traps compounds that are unpleasant.\n\nWhiskey contains fatty acid esters that have two very different ends. The head is electrostatically attracted to water and the tail is not. Fatty acid esters in water can form compounds called micelles. In micelles, all the tails come together in the middle while the heads form a sphere on the outside, like a bouquet of lollipops with their sticks all tied together on the inside. Adding water to whiskey could, theoretically, cause more micelles to form, trapping compounds that don't taste or smell good.\n\nA competing theory suggests that adding water releases molecules that improve the flavor. Water and ethanol don't make for a perfectly uniform mixture. Aromatic compounds could become trapped in ethanol clusters and never reach the surface. Our tongues are only capable of identifying the flavors, sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (savory), so aroma is really important for detecting all the other flavors that connoisseurs appreciate in whiskey.\n\nKarlsson and Friedman did calculations and found that fatty acid esters exist in such low concentrations that the first theory is unlikely, so they decided to focus on the second. In reality, \"whiskey is a complicated mixture of hundreds or even thousands of compounds,\" Karlsson said. They focused on just three: water, ethanol, and an aromatic compound called guaiacol.\n\nGuaiacol is what gives whiskey that smoky, spicy, peaty flavor. Chemically, guaiacol is similar to a lot of other whiskey aroma compounds like vanillin (with the scent of vanilla) and limonene (citrus). These and other flavor compounds are not attracted to water and are more likely to become trapped in ethanol clusters.\n\nIn the researchers' simulations, they found that the concentration of ethanol had a large effect on guaiacol. At concentrations above 59 percent ethanol (the alcohol content to which whiskey is distilled) the guaiacol was mixed throughout. Whiskey is diluted before bottling to about 40 percent ethanol. In the simulation, at 40 percent, ethanol accumulated near the surface, bringing the guaiacol with it. At about 27 percent the ethanol began to aerosolize, presumably freeing the guaiacol even further.\n\nIf their state of the art simulations were a SIMS video game, you would play the role of a stressed out bartender and spend hours adjusting the water and alcohol levels back and forth. Not enough water, and the guaiacol won't bubble up into the nostrils of your whiskey-swilling patrons. Too much, and your angry customers spit out the flavorless, watered down spirits.\n\n\"Adding water changes the equilibrium,\" said Daniel Lacks who was not involved with the study, but conducts similar modeling experiments at Case Western University. The new model shows that diluting the whiskey \"causes molecules to rise to the surface.\"\n\nBut Paul Hughes, a food scientist and distilling expert at Oregon State, was not convinced that the propensity of ethanol to rise to the surface when whiskey is diluted tells the whole story. In the simulation, only three types of molecules were included, and their activity was modeled in a very tiny volume of spirits. \"My sense is that the box they've used isn't tall enough,\" Hughes said.\n\nThe ratio of surface area to volume in the simulation is not at all similar to what you get with a bottle or a glass, he said. He predicts that disruption of the ethanol clusters within the bulk of the whiskey may also be important.\n\nWhether by disrupting ethanol clusters or encouraging the molecules to rise to the surface, it's clear that adding water to whiskey has the molecular potential to release important flavor compounds like guaiacol. So why isn't whiskey simply bottled at lower alcohol concentrations?\n\nIf diluting whiskey really does mean that aromatic molecules evaporate from the surface, \"by bottling at higher concentrations, you get less deterioration of taste,\" Lacks said. Whiskey, by definition, has to be 40 percent alcohol, said Hughes. Diluting it would also increase packaging and distribution costs and take away the choice from the consumer.\n\nAt the end of the day, individuals should drink their whisky however they prefer it, said Hughes, but \"if someone says they don't like whiskey,\" he added, \"they just haven't tried the right one yet.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nA trip to Whiskey Acres, farm-turned-distillery in DeKalb\n\nBarley's Angels, Women Who Whiskey, Bourbon Women breaking stigma of a 'woman's palate'\n\nWhen creating a new whiskey, Angel's path a good one to follow", "id": "9750873", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The best way to drink whiskey, according to science", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5995d6b4/turbine/ct-best-way-to-drink-whiskey-20170817", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemical compound"}, "id": "305541", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Odor"}, "id": "308175", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olfaction"}, "id": "311250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vanilla"}, "id": "311933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "id": "320610", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fatty acid"}, "id": "323842", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aroma compound"}, "id": "330941", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}, "id": "335287", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umami"}, "id": "335386", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami"}, {"label": {"eng": "Biomaterial"}, "id": "338539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ester"}, "id": "338702", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 708, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo"}], "time": "18:12:00"}

Diluting it would also increase packaging and distribution costs and take away the choice from the consumer.\n\nAt the end of the day, individuals should drink their whisky however they prefer it, said Hughes, but \"if someone says they don't like whiskey,\" he added, \"they just haven't tried the right one yet.\"", "id": "9772691", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "How about a splash of science in your whiskey?", "image": "http://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/afp_rn17z1.jpg?w=640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemical compound"}, "id": "305541", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Odor"}, "id": "308175", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olfaction"}, "id": "311250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vanilla"}, "id": "311933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "id": "320610", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fatty acid"}, "id": "323842", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aroma compound"}, "id": "330941", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umami"}, "id": "335386", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami"}, {"label": {"eng": "Biomaterial"}, "id": "338539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomaterial"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ester"}, "id": "338702", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aromaticity"}, "id": "361850", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 708, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo"}], "time": "12:56:00"}

A couple of chemists in Sweden set out to figure out why adding a little water would improve the drink's taste.\n\nThey say the taste improvement happens because alcohol molecules and those that determine whiskey's taste tend to stick together. Their findings were published Thursday in Scientific Reports.\n\nFirst, the scientists developed computer model simulations that strip whiskey down to its most basic elements: water and ethanol, or alcohol.\n\nThey then simulated how the molecules interacted at different concentrations with guaiacol, a molecule common in single-malt Scotch whiskeys that gives them a smoky taste.\n\nWater and alcohol don't uniformly mix together. And guaiacol molecules tend to bind to alcohol molecules, says Bjorn Karlsson, a computational chemist from Linnaeus University who co-wrote the paper. Both kinds of molecules are partially repelled by water.\n\nThe researchers found in their simulations at lower alcohol concentrations that the taste-creating molecules and the alcohol molecules would cluster on the surface of the glass near the air.\n\nBut at higher alcohol concentrations, the molecules associated with taste will spread out through the glass. \"When you increase concentration of ethanol, ethanol will sort of be totally at the interface [between the liquid and the air], fill up the total space at the interface and then start to also be found in the bulk\" of the glass, Karlsson says. \"And then a lot of the taste compounds will then be transferred from the interface into the bulk.\"\n\nThe researchers think the position of these taste molecules in the glass has a big impact on the smell and taste of the Scotch whisky.\n\nIf the molecules are right on the surface, as they are in lower concentrations, \"the first thing that you will experience on the tongue is what's on the interface.\" The compounds are also more likely to actually come off the surface as a gas, increasing the drink's aroma.\n\nKarlsson says this helps to explain why whiskey is diluted before bottling. Straight out of the cask, it might be up to 65 percent alcohol by volume, though it is typically then diluted to about 40 percent before bottling.\n\nAdding a few drops of water would therefore continue to increase the concentration of guaiacol molecules at the surface, potentially improving the taste.\n\nHow much water should you add? People \"want to know what the recipe is, how much water you should actually get to get the best taste out of it,\" Karlsson says.\n\nAnd that is not something he claims to have. Even though their research points to a reason why taste might be improved through dilution, the scientists provide no guidelines for how much water to add. Whiskey preferences are personal, and it's \"very hard to say something in general,\" he says.\n\nAnd whiskey is \"among the most complicated products there is in terms of chemical composition,\" the chemist adds. \"So we have selected one component as a model for one group out of many groups found in whiskey.\"\n\nThat component -- the one that produces a smoky flavor in single malt Scotch -- has chemical similarities to other molecules used to flavor various whiskies, like vanillin. Karlsson says, \"It's a fairly high probability that they would behave the same.\"\n\nWhiskey enthusiasts sometimes say that adding water breaks the surface tension of the drink, allowing more of its aroma to escape. Karlsson says he thinks the team's research supports that theory, because by adding water, \"there will more ethanol molecules at the interface relative [to those] found in the bulk. In turn, that will then lead to a lowering of the surface tension.\"\n\nAnd with more of the taste compound at the surface, it's more likely that it will evaporate, he says, which could enhance the aromas.\n\nBut it is probably wise to not use a heavy hand watering down your whiskey in order to improve its taste. Karlsson does suggest that there could be a chemical reason to avoid putting too much water into your whiskey.\n\n\"We have receptors on our tongue, in our nose, that are sensitive and depend upon the concentration of the specific components you want to detect with your nose and tongue,\" he says. \"So if it's too diluted there's a risk that you actually don't detect it with your nose or your tongue.\"\n\nGood luck figuring out the balance that tastes best to you!", "id": "9756802", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Chemists Say You Should Add A Little Water To Your Whiskey.

Researchers at Linnaeus University in Sweden have found that adding water to whisky alters the drink's molecules to make it taste better.\n\nWhisky is a chemically complicated beverage. After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled. However, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 percent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly.\n\nResearchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky.\"The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,\" said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University.\n\n\"One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,\" Karlsson said.\n\nResearchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions.They found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid.\n\n\"This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,\" said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University.\"Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface.\n\n\"An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,\" Friedman said.\n\nThese findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass.\n\n\"How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual.

Rather than watering it down, the addition may act as a flavor enhancement, and we now know the science behind it, thanks to a new study.\n\nThe combination is a bit counterintuitive, which is part of the reason researchers wanted to look at the molecular chemistry behind what's happening in your whiskey glass.\n\nOn the surface, whiskey seems simple: It's mostly barley malt and water that goes through a specific process. But from a chemistry standpoint, whiskey includes a complex variety of molecules that contribute to its unique taste. One of those is the compound guaiacol, which lends itself to the smokiness associated with some whiskeys.\n\nGuaiacol is the molecule that two researchers from the Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry in Sweden focused on for their study, published Thursday in the journal Nature.\n\nThe researchers looked at both bottled and cask-strength whiskey. Bottled whiskey has been diluted to about 40% alcohol by volume, down from 70% after distilling. Cask whiskey is stronger, at about 55% to 65% alcohol by volume, even if some alcohol evaporates as it matures in barrels for at least three years.\n\nWhat they discovered is that guaiacol is most present at the surface of diluted whiskey, which is why whiskey with added water tastes better: The taste molecules are at the top of your glass.\n\n\"From a molecular perspective, water and alcohol don't completely mix,\" co-author Ran Friedman wrote in an email. \"Instead, we have clusters of water molecules and clusters of alcohol molecules. When whisky is diluted, the alcohol is driven to the surface, and many of the taste molecules follow it because they like to be in a slightly less aqueous environment. The taste that we experience is therefore enhanced -- but there's a limit. If we dilute the whisky too much the concentration of the taste compounds is reduced and the drink will be meager.\"\n\nIn higher-alcohol whiskey, the flavor is different because the taste molecules aren't reacting to the presence of water.\n\n\"The most interesting finding was that at high alcohol by volume concentrations -- 59% and up, cask-strength whisky -- the taste compound was surrounded by ethanol molecules in the solution,\" Friedman wrote.\n\nFriedman and colleague Bjorn Karlsson didn't discover this through taste, although both like whiskey, but by using computer simulations of the molecules.\n\n\"They enable us to follow on chemical processes as if we're watching a molecular movie. We usually work on problems that have something to do with biology or human health, but at some point got interested in understanding why dilution affects the taste of whisky,\" Friedman said.\n\nThe researchers believe their findings can be applied to other aged spirits, like brandy, rum and tequila, because they have similar solutions, taste compounds and alcohol by volume.\n\nThough they didn't drink any whiskey during the study, the two researchers enjoy traditional Swedish snaps (what we might call schnapps), ice-cold and undiluted.\n\n\"We believe that the principles we describe are true for a long list of taste compounds,\" Friedman said. \"In that case, one can find an optimal alcohol content for a spirit to taste best for many drinkers. The conclusions may also apply for the food industry, as some extracts that are used in the industry are stored in diluted alcohol solutions.\"\n\nWhen it comes to whiskey and how best to enjoy it, it can be a very personal choice.\n\nAs a mixologist at the Bar at Husk Restaurant in Charleston, South Carolina, Rod Weaver likes to offer a pour of bourbon or rye whiskey in two ways: neat and over ice.\n\n\"This approach allows the drinker to compare the two; one room temp, and the other throughout the natural dilution as the ice melts over time,\" Weaver wrote in an email. \"There will be considerable change as it 'opens up.' This can also happen with oxidation.\"\n\nBut as a whiskey lover, he recommends becoming acquainted with the type of whiskey \"just the way the maker intended\" before changing it in any way, whether it's \"a 10-year plus, non-chill filtered, barrel-proof 'Haz-Mat' (over 140 proof) face-melting monster, or a 6-month-young local and grainy infant\" whiskey.\n\nHe believes that Scots were most likely the first to dilute their whiskey in the glass, while blenders and distillers of whiskey decide how much to dilute their products individually.\n\n\"But the best way to taste bourbon is hot, straight out the bottle,\" Weaver said. \"Chew it around your mouth, swallow, and feel the Kentucky hug.\"\n\nLeNell Smothers, owner of LeNell's Ltd. in Brooklyn, tells people to drink whiskey however they like it best. She isn't one to say there's a \"proper\" way to drink.\n\nShe also sells her own brand of whiskey called Red Hook Rye, and includes a formula for how to add water to reduce proof in the packaging of her barrels. The formula comes from Chuck Cowdery's book \"Bourbon, Straight.\"\n\n\"Divide the proof you have by the proof you want and subtract one,\" Smothers wrote in an email. \"Multiply that number by the amount of whiskey you want to dilute and the result will be the amount of water to add. For example, to reduce 2 ounces of 135 proof whiskey to 100 proof, divide 135 by 100 and subtract one. Multiply that number by 2 ounces. You add 0.7 ounces water to 2 ounces Red Hook Rye to make it 100 proof.\n\n\"The only time I do highly recommend adding water is when drinking a cask-strength whiskey, a whiskey that has been bottled straight from the barrel to the bottle without addition of water,\" Smothers said. \"Those high proofs are fine for a sip to taste the power of the spirit; however, if you drink barrel-proof whiskeys, the strength could damage the lining of your esophagus, besides the fact you may end up with a nasty hangover.\"", "id": "9785207", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Why whiskey tastes

It's counterintuitive, though, since water usually dilutes the taste of food and drink. But researchers from Sweden now say they can explain why it works in liquor.\n\nBefore aging, distilled malt Scotch whisky, for example, is about 70 percent alcohol by volume. Some of the alcohol evaporates, and as the whisky ages in wooden barrels, it drops down to about 55 to 65 percent alcohol. When it's ready to be bottled, distillers add water, typically diluting the whisky to about 40 percent alcohol by volume.\n\n\"People claim that's when you get a dramatic change in the taste and smell of whiskey,\" said Bj\u00f6rn Karlsson, a chemist at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The South's Best Bourbon\n\nIf that's not enough, some whiskey drinkers add another splash of water into their glass before sipping. According to connoisseurs, adding water opens up the drink, giving it fuller, more complex flavors.\n\nWhiskey is indeed a complex liquid. While water and alcohol, namely ethanol, are the primary components, there are hundreds -- if not thousands -- of other chemical compounds that give whiskey its range of tastes and aromas. And the factors that affect those flavors -- such as dilution -- are complicated.\n\nWhiskeys often contain molecules called fatty acid esters, and the addition of water causes those molecules to clump together into spheres called micelles. Scientists have hypothesized that the round chemical structures change the flavor because they trap certain flavor compounds, preventing them from evaporating and reaching the smell receptors in your nose or touching the taste receptors on your tongue. By masking these compounds, extra water changes the flavor of the whiskey.\n\nBut Karlsson wasn't convinced. Many kinds of whiskeys don't have enough fatty acid esters to form micelles, he said.\n\nCurious for a better explanation, he and Ran Friedman, another chemist at Linnaeus University, used a computer to model the behavior of whiskey at the molecular level. They simulated what happens when you mix 5,000 molecules of water and ethanol at different proportions. To represent a flavor compound, they also threw in a single molecule called guaiacol, which is associated with whiskey's characteristic smoky flavor.\n\nBecause guaiacol and ethanol share similar properties, they associate with each other. Both molecules have one part that's attracted to water and another part that's repelled by it. So to avoid contact with water, ethanol gathers at the surface -- and so does guaiacol. At the surface, the guaiacol is more likely to touch your tongue or evaporate into your nose.\n\nDiluting whiskey, then, may simply make flavor compounds like guaiacol more readily available to be sniffed, sipped and savored.\n\nThis explanation, published today in the journal Scientific Reports, seems more likely than the micelle hypothesis, Karlsson said. And for whiskey drinkers, the takeaway is clear: \"It seems like a good idea to add water to your whiskey,\" he said. \"It will improve its taste and smell.\"\n\nBut because whiskey is so chemically complex, it's likely that this is one of multiple reasons why dilution enhances flavor, said Eric Simanek, a chemist at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth and co-author of Shots of Knowledge: The Science of Whiskey.\n\nAnd while the researchers simulated a wide range of dilution levels, it doesn't explain the effect of adding a tiny amount of water, as some whiskey aficionados do. \"What the paper doesn't address is this phenomenon when you add just a single drop -- the slightest dilutions and the impact that has on flavor and perception,\" Simanek said.\n\nStill, he noted, the new work adds invaluable insight to understanding whiskey. \"It's a new way to look at the whole problem,\" he said. \"I find it delightful.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared on Inside Science.", "id":

A team of Swedish chemists set out to find out why and how dilution enhances the taste of whiskey.\n\nWriting in a study published in Scientific Reports, researchers said they performed computer simulations of how water and ethanol mixes with a molecule called guaiacol, which helps give Scotch its distinctive, smoky taste and smell.\n\nThey found that ethanol molecules and guaiacol molecules tend to stick together, and are both \"hydrophobic\" -- which means that don't mix uniformly with water.\n\nThe researchers' simulations aimed to determine at what ethanol levels had the most impact on guaiacol, or rather, the taste and smell of whiskey.\n\nWhen the whiskey with an ethanol concentration of 59%, the taste and smell was mixed throughout.\n\nIn a glass of whiskey, which typically exhibits alcohol concentrations of 45% or 27% if diluted, guaiacol will thus be found near the liquid surface, where it greatly contributes to both smell and taste of the spirit.\n\n\"This indicates that the taste of guaiacol in the whiskey would be enhanced upon dilution prior to bottling,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nIt should be noted that the report does not mention if ice would provide the same effect as water, although, as we all known, the key ingredient in ice is, well, water.\n\nIn the end, the researchers believe that their simulations found that the higher the ethanol concentration at the time of bottling, the better the whiskey will be when it is poured and diluted.\n\n\"Dilution of cask-strength whiskey improves its taste by increasing the propensity of taste compounds at the liquid-air interface,\" the report notes.\n\nBut don't expect your next bottle of whiskey to come diluted.

It's then aged in barrels, where some of the alcohol evaporates. Then, before bottling, it's diluted further with water.\n\nWhisky connoisseurs have known it for centuries, but now scientists have an explanation for why adding a little bit more water to whisky once it's out of the bottle enhances the taste.\n\nAt first sight it might seem puzzling. Water itself doesn't really have a taste, so why would adding a tiny bit of it change the taste of the whisky so much?\n\nA study in the journal Scientific Reports finds that it's all down to the solubility of certain aromatic molecules in the whisky.\n\nMuch of the drink's characteristic taste is down to a particular type of molecule that can bind to both fatty and watery molecules. In contrast, most small molecules are much more soluble in either water or fatty liquids, but not both.\n\nOne such dual-character molecule in whisky is guaiacol. At lower ethanol concentrations guaiacol is most likely to be found at the surface of the liquid, contributing to the smell and taste of the drink. At higher concentrations, guaiacol interacts more tightly with ethanol and so it becomes buried down in the drink and contributes less to the taste.\n\nThe researchers used computer simulations to test the behaviour of guaiacol in different concentrations of water-ethanol mixes. Below about 45% guaiacol was free to contribute strongly to taste. Above about 59%, it would have a negligible contribution to taste as it was mostly bound to ethanol.\n\nThis research may have more relevance to whiskies from some regions than others, as their particular chemical characteristics and tastes vary from place to place.\n\n\"Many whiskies, especially those that are made on the Scottish island of Isley, have a typical smoky taste that develops when malted barley is smoked on peat fire. Chemically, the smoky flavour is attributed to phenols, and in particular guaiacol, which is much more common in Scottish whiskies than in American or Irish ones,\" the study authors, led by Bj\u00f6rn Karlsson of Linn\u00e6us University, Sweden, write in the paper.", "id": "9691903", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The delicious mystery of why water and whisky work so well together finally solved by science", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1492235/alcohol-brain.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "84296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smoking (cooking)"}, "id": "305369", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid"}, "id": "305550", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt"}, "id": "316533", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peat"}, "id": "333899", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}, "id": "335287", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oak (wine)"}, "id": "337764", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(wine)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aromaticity"}, "id": "361850", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Solubility"}, "id": "380494", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guaiacol"}, "id": "1024643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaiacol"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}], "time": "13:02:00"}

(In the United States, bourbon whiskeycontains at least 51 percent corn.) It is often aged in wooden casks, and grains may be smoked over peat prior to fermentation to impart a smoky flavor].\n\nMany historical figures have waxed poetic over whiskey. For instance, playwright George Bernard Shaw opined that \"whisky is liquid sunshine,\" while author Mark Twain thought \"too much of anything is bad, but too much good whiskey is barely enough.\" [11 Interesting Facts About Hangovers]\n\nBefore whiskey is bottled, water is often added to it to dilute it to about 40 percent alcohol by volume, in the belief that doing so significantly changes its flavor, Karlsson said. Whiskey enthusiasts also often add a few drops of water to whiskey before drinking it to enhance its taste. But how dilution might achieve this effect was not clear until now.\n\nTo help solve this mystery, Karlsson and his colleague Ran Friedman, also at Linnaeus University, carried out computer simulations of water and alcohol. The simulations also included organic compounds associated with the flavor of whiskey. Many of these molecules are so-called amphipathic molecules, which have both water-repelling and water-attracting regions.\n\nThe researchers focused on a small amphipathic compound known as guaiacol. This molecule is linked with the smoky taste that develops when malted barley is smoked on peat fires, and is far more common in Scottish whiskies than in American or Irish ones, the researchers said.\n\nWhen the computer models diluted whiskey to just 45 percent alcohol, guaiacol was more likely to be present at the surface of the whiskey than in the bulk of the liquid. This would help the guaiacol better contribute to both the smell and taste of the spirit at this interface between the fluid and the air, the researchers report online Aug. 17 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nIn contrast, at concentrations of alcohol above 59 percent, guaiacol was driven away from the surface of the whiskey. The researchers said they expect similar results with other flavor molecules found in whiskey, such as vanillin, found in vanilla extract, and limonene, found in lemon and orange oils.\n\nThis work could help optimize the alcohol concentrations of other spirits, such as gin, rum and brandy, Karlsson said.

(Photo by Deb Lindsey for The Washington Post)\n\nTwo physical chemists walk into a bar. They order whiskeys, and a jolly Scotsman one stool over insists they add a splash of water to optimize the flavor of the spirits. Inspired by the smooth, smoky flavor, they vow to investigate a question whiskey enthusiasts answered decades ago: Does adding water to whiskey really make it taste better?\n\nThat's the almost true story behind a paper published this week in the journal Scientific Reports. Bjorn Karlsson and Ran Friedman of The Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry are not whiskey drinkers, but Friedman did visit Scotland, and he raised an eyebrow at the local's dedication to watering down even the fanciest Scotch.\n\nLike a good scientist, he wanted to test the assumption, so he teamed up with Karlsson and used computer simulations to model the molecular composition of whiskey.\n\nThere are two competing theories for why adding water to whiskey might improve the flavor, Karlsson said. The first suggests that adding water traps compounds that are unpleasant.\n\nWhiskey contains fatty acid esters that have two very different ends. The head is electrostatically attracted to water, and tail is not. Fatty acid esters in water can form compounds called micelles. In micelles, all the tails come together in the middle while the heads form a sphere on the outside, like a bouquet of lolly pops with their sticks all tied together on the inside. Adding water to whiskey could, theoretically, cause more micelles to form, trapping compounds that don't taste or smell good.\n\nA competing theory suggests that adding water releases molecules that improve the flavor. Water and ethanol don't make for a perfectly uniform mixture. Aromatic compounds could become trapped in ethanol clusters and never reach the surface. Our tongues are only capable of identifying the flavors, sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami (savory), so aroma is really important for detecting all the other flavors that connoisseurs appreciate in whiskey.\n\nKarlsson and Friedman did calculations and found that fatty acid esters exist in such low concentrations that the first theory is unlikely, so they decided to focus on the second. In reality, \"whiskey is a complicated mixture of hundreds or even thousands of compounds,\" said Karlsson. They focused on just three: water, ethanol, and an aromatic compound called guaiacol.\n\nGuaiacol is what gives whiskey that smoky, spicy, peaty flavor. Chemically, guaiacol is similar to a lot of other whiskey aroma compounds like vanillin (with the scent of vanilla) and limonene (citrus). These and other flavor compounds are not attracted to water and are more likely to become trapped in ethanol clusters.\n\nIn the researchers' simulations, they found that the concentration of ethanol had a large effect on guaiacol. At concentrations above 59 percent ethanol (the alcohol content to which whiskey is distilled) the guaiacol was mixed throughout. Whiskey is diluted before bottling to about 40 percent ethanol. In the simulation, at 40 percent, ethanol accumulated near the surface, bringing the guaiacol with it. At about 27 percent the ethanol began to aerosolize, presumably freeing the guaiacol even further.\n\nIf their state of the art simulations were a SIMS video game, you would play the role of a stressed out bartender and spend hours adjusting the water and alcohol levels back and forth. Not enough water, and the guaiacol won't bubble up into the nostrils of your whiskey-swilling patrons. Too much, and your angry customers spit out the flavorless, watered down spirits.\n\n\"Adding water changes the equilibrium,\" said Daniel Lacks who was not involved with the study, but conducts similar modeling experiments at Case Western University. The new model shows that diluting the whiskey \"causes molecules to rise to the surface.\"\n\nBut Paul Hughes, a food scientist and distilling expert at Oregon State, was not convinced that the propensity of ethanol to rise to the surface when whiskey is diluted tells the whole story. In the simulation, only three types of molecules were included, and their activity was modeled in a very tiny volume of spirits. \"My sense is that the box they've used isn't tall enough,\" said Hughes.\n\nThe ratio of surface area to volume in the simulation is not at all similar to what you get with a bottle or a glass, he said. He predicts that disruption of the ethanol clusters within the bulk of the whiskey may also be important.\n\nWhether by disrupting ethanol clusters or encouraging the molecules to rise to the surface, it's clear that adding water to whiskey has the molecular potential to release important flavor compounds like guaiacol. So why isn't whiskey simply bottled at lower alcohol concentrations?\n\nIf diluting whiskey really does mean that aromatic molecules evaporate from the surface, \"by bottling at higher concentrations, you get less deterioration of taste,\" said Lacks. Whiskey, by definition, has to be 40 percent alcohol, said Hughes. Diluting it would also increase packaging and distribution costs and take away the choice from the consumer.\n\nAt the end of the day, individuals should drink their whisky however they prefer it, said Hughes, but \"if someone says they don't like whiskey,\" he added, \"they just haven't tried the right one yet.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThis concentrated hop powder is making brewers go crazy\n\nNutrition science isn't broken, it's just wicked hard\n\nOne surprising way money can buy happiness, according to scientists", "id": "9692673", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The best way to drink whiskey, according to science", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/06/Food/Images/FirstBite0712_011.JPG?t=20170517", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "84296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Food"}, "id": "303078", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}, "id": "304270", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemical compound"}, "id": "305541", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ice"}, "id": "305987", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Odor"}, "id": "308175", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olfaction"}, "id": "311250", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vanilla"}, "id": "311933", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Case Western Reserve University"}, "id": "320610", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Western_Reserve_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fatty acid"}, "id": "323842", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aroma compound"}, "id": "330941", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroma_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}, "id": "335287", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Umami"}, "id": "335386", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 708, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo"}], "time": "13:06:00"}

definitive proof that scotch always tastes better with water.\n\nUsing computer simulation, they found that partially diluting whisky improves the drinking experience because it drives flavour compounds to the surface.\n\nPublished in the journal Scientific Reports, the study showed that alcohol tends to push the key chemical guaiacol, which causes whisky's smokey taste, to the bottom of a glass or bottle.\n\nThere is a fine balance between diluting the whisky to taste and diluting the whisky to wasteProfessor Bjorn Karlsson, Linnaeus University\n\nReducing the alcohol content reverses this process, improving the drink's flavour.\n\nWhisky's distinctive taste comes about by a combination of the distillation of fermented grains, ageing and then dilution.\n\nDistilled malt whiskies typically contain around 70 per cent alcohol by volume before it is aged in barrels for at least three years.\n\nSome alcohol evaporates during the maturation resulting in an alcohol content of 55 to 65 per cent for cask-strength whisky.\n\nBefore bottling, the whisky is diluted to around 40 per cent by the addition of water, a process called \"cutting\", which further changes the taste.\n\nHowever, the team at Linnaeus University say a further dash of water is still needed after the spirit is poured to achieve the best flavour.\n\nThey carried out computer simulations of mixtures of water and pure alcohol, or ethanol, in the presence of guaiacol.\n\nAt concentrations of alcohol up to 45 per cent,guaicol was more likely to be present at the surface of the liquid, rather than in the bulk.\n\n\"Overall, there is a fine balance between diluting the whisky to taste and diluting the whisky to waste,\" said Professor Bjorn Karlsson, who carried out the research.\n\n\"This balance will depend on the concentration and types of taste compounds that are characteristic for each whisky.\n\n\"Similar considerations can be used to optimise the alcohol concentration of other spirits including gin, rum and brandy.\"\n\nMany whiskies, especially those that are made on the Scottish island of Islay, have a typical smoky taste that develops when malted barley is smoked on peat fire.\n\nChemically, the smoky flavour is attributed to phenols, and in particular guaiacol, which is much more common in Scottish whiskies than in American or Irish ones.\n\nOn the whole Scottish whiskies have higher levels of guaiacol than Irish or American equivalents.\n\nThe chemical was originally discovered by the Italian chemist Ascanio Sobrero, who is much better known for discovering nitroglycerine.\n\nProfessor Karlsson said guaiacol contributes to both the taste and aroma of whisky.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Scotch Whisky Association, an industry trade organisation, said taste was only \"one aspect\" of flavour.\n\n\"So it is easier to perceive the aroma compounds in the 'headspace' above the whisky when water is added as they become less soluble and are driven out of the liquid.\n\n\"The other factor is that reducing alcohol strength or increasing water concentration reduces the alcohol sensation on the nose and tongue, which would otherwise mask the more subtle aroma compounds.\"\n\nAccording to a historic Scottish proverb: \"There are two things a Highlander likes naked, and one of them is malt whisky.\"\n\nProfessor

Researchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky. \"The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,\" said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University. \"One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,\" Karlsson said. Researchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions.\n\nThey found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid. \"This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,\" said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University. \"Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface. \"An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,\" Friedman said. These findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass. \"How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual. Some people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,\" Karlsson added.", "id": "9881219", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Why whisky tastes better with water revealed", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/1495292540_whisky.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "198", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Solution"}, "id": "303226", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smoke"}, "id": "305054", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid"}, "id": "305550", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peat"}, "id": "333899", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oak (wine)"}, "id": "337764", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(wine)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hydrophile"}, "id": "364029", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hydrophobe"}, "id": "397470", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mashing"}, "id": "405995", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt whisky"}, "id": "443409", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt_whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amphiphile"}, "id": "479916", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Linnaeus University"}, "id": "851486", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus_University"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1504, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic"}], "time": "11:25:00"}

A couple of chemists in Sweden set out to figure out why adding a little water would improve the drink's taste.\n\nThey say the taste improvement happens because alcohol molecules and those that determine whiskey's taste tend to stick together. Their findings were published today in Scientific Reports.\n\nFirst, the scientists developed computer model simulations that strip whiskey down to its most basic elements: water and ethanol, or alcohol.\n\nThey then simulated how the molecules interacted at different concentrations with guaiacol, a molecule common in single-malt Scotch whiskies that gives them a smoky taste.\n\nWater and alcohol don't uniformly mix together. And guaiacol molecules tend to bind to alcohol molecules, says Bjorn Karlsson, a computational chemist from Linnaeus University who co-wrote the paper. Both kinds of molecules are partially repelled by water.\n\nThe researchers found that in their simulations at lower alcohol concentrations, the taste-creating molecules and the alcohol molecules would cluster on the surface of the glass near the air.\n\nBut at higher alcohol concentrations, the molecules associated with taste will spread out through the glass. \"When you increase concentration of ethanol, ethanol will sort of be totally at the interface [between the liquid and the air], fill up the total space at the interface and then start to also be found in the bulk\" of the glass, Karlsson says. \"And then a lot of the taste compounds will then be transferred from the interface into the bulk.\"\n\nThe researchers think the position of these taste molecules in the glass has a big impact on the smell and taste of the Scotch whisky.\n\nIf the molecules are right on the surface, as they are in lower concentrations, \"the first thing that you will experience on the tongue is what's on the interface.\" The compounds are also more likely to actually come off the surface as a gas, increasing the drink's aroma.\n\nKarlsson says this helps to explain why whiskey is diluted before bottling. Straight out of the cask, it might be up to 65 percent alcohol by volume, though it is typically then diluted to about 40 percent before bottling.\n\nAdding a few drops of water would therefore continue to increase the concentration of guaiacol molecules at the surface, potentially improving the taste.\n\nHow much water should you add? People \"want to know what the recipe is, how much water you should actually get to get the best taste out of it,\" Karlsson says.\n\nAnd that's not something he claims to have. Even though their research points to a reason why taste might be improved through dilution, they provide no guidelines for how much water to add. People's whiskey preferences are personal, and it's \"very hard to say something in general,\" he says.\n\nAnd whiskey is \"among the most complicated products there is in terms of chemical composition,\" the chemist adds. \"So we have selected one component as a model for one group out of many groups found in whiskey.\"\n\nThat component -- the one that produces a smoky flavor in single malt Scotch -- has chemical similarities with other molecules used to flavor whiskies, like vanillin. Karlsson says \"it's a fairly high probability that they would behave the same.\"\n\nBut probably don't use a heavy hand watering down your whiskey in order to improve its taste. Even though whiskey preferences are personal, Karlsson does suggest that there could be a chemical reason to avoid putting too much water into your whiskey.\n\n\"We have receptors on our tongue, in our nose, that are sensitive and depend upon the concentration of the specific components you want to detect with your nose and tongue,\" he says. \"So if it's too diluted there's a risk that you actually don't detect it with your nose or your tongue.\"\n\nGood luck figuring out the balance that tastes best to you!", "id": "9696552", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Chemists Say You Should Add A Little Water To Your Whiskey.

After malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturing, for at least three years in oak barrels, it is bottled.\n\nHowever, first whisky is usually diluted to around 40 per cent of alcohol by volume by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly.\n\nResearchers solved a piece of the puzzle that will help us better understand the chemical qualities of whisky.\n\n\"The taste of whisky is primarily linked to so-called amphipathic molecules, which are made up of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts,\" said Bjorn Karlsson, chemistry researcher at Linnaeus University.\n\n\"One such molecule is guaiacol, a substance that develops when the grain is dried over peat smoke when making malt whisky, providing the smoky flavour to the whisky,\" Karlsson said.\n\nResearchers carried out computer simulations of water/ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol to study its interactions.\n\nThey found that guaiacol was preferentially associated with ethanol molecules and that in mixtures with concentrations of ethanol up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be present at the liquid-air interface than in the bulk of the liquid.\n\n\"This suggests that, in a glass of whisky, guaiacol will therefore be found near the surface of the liquid, where it contributes to both the smell and taste of the spirit,\" said Ran Friedman, researcher in chemistry at Linnaeus University.\n\n\"Interestingly, a continued dilution down to 27 per cent resulted in an increase of guaiacol at the liquid-air interface.\n\n\"An increased percentage, over 59 per cent, had the opposite effect, that is to say, the ethanol interacted more strongly with the guaiacol, driving the molecule into the solution away from the surface,\" Friedman said.\n\nThese findings suggest that the taste and aroma of guaiacol, and similar compounds in whisky, are enhanced when the spirit is diluted prior to bottling and this taste may be more pronounced on further dilution in the glass.\n\n\"How we experience taste and aroma is highly individual.\n\nSome people choose to add ice cubes to their whisky, to cool it down and give it a milder taste. Thus, there is no general answer to how much water you should add to your whisky to get the best taste experience,\" Karlsson added.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9876661", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Why whisky tastes better with water revealed", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "198", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Solution"}, "id": "303226", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smoke"}, "id": "305054", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid"}, "id": "305550", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peat"}, "id": "333899", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oak (wine)"}, "id": "337764", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(wine)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hydrophile"}, "id": "364029", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hydrophobe"}, "id": "397470", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mashing"}, "id": "405995", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt whisky"}, "id": "443409", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt_whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amphiphile"}, "id": "479916", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Linnaeus University"}, "id": "851486", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus_University"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 894, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1504, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Inorganic"}], "time": "10:57:00"}

Dilution of cask strength whisky drives taste contributing compounds such as guaiacol away from the bulk of the liquid to its surface thus improving the perception of guaiacol\n\nWHAT DID THEY FIND?\n\nResearchers carried out computer simulations of how water and ethanol mixes in the presence of guaiacol over a period of 50 nano seconds.\n\nThe authors found that in concentrations of up to 45 per cent guaiacol was more likely to be at the surface of the glass rather than in the bulk of the liquid.\n\nWhen it is at the surface it is more able to give off desirable smoky aromas.\n\nAt concentrations more than 59 per cent the authors found ethanol interacts more strongly with guaiacol which means the molecule is driven down into the solution and away from the surface.\n\nThis would mean the smoky taste was less prominent -

Pub lore says that it makes the flavour pop, and experiments confirmed it and told us why. Now, chemists have duplicated that result without resorting to complicated apparatus, and their findings could tell us how certain types of drugs move through the body.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Karlsson and Ran Friedman at Linnaeus University in Sweden used a computer simulation to model how the ethanol molecules in whisky interact with water. To capture the molecular motion precisely, they simulated the mixing using tiny time steps, equivalent to half a trillion frames per second.\n\nThen, they added a single molecule called guaiacol, which provides some of scotch's distinctive smoky and bitter flavour.\n\nThey found that when liquor is at or above 40 percent alcohol by volume, guaiacol molecules tend to stay in the body of the liquid, away from the surface. But when the researchers diluted the simulated whisky to about 25 percent alcohol, the guaiacol floated to the top and wafted its smoky scent and taste front and center.\n\n\"We found a result that supports the claims for diluting whisky,\" says Karlsson. The researchers now hope to figure out how drugs containing a similar mix of molecules behave inside the body. Some cough medicine, for instance, contains guaiacol, water and glycerol, another alcohol molecule.\n\nTo the casual sipper, 25 percent may seem watery. \"There's quite a lot of snobbery about this,\" says Paul Hughes at Oregon State University, who researches alcoholic beverages.\n\nBut the professionals who mix single-malt whiskies to make blended ones taste samples diluted to about 20 per cent.\n\nPrevious experiments showed that flavour compounds like guaiacol tend to stick to ethanol. Before dilution, when the alcohol concentration is high, ethanol molecules tend to hover in clusters in the middle of the liquid, which keeps the guaiacol molecules from rising to the surface.\n\nAs water dilutes the whisky, the ethanol spreads more uniformly, allowing more of the guaiacol to reach the surface. \"It all comes back to the strange behaviour of alcohol in water,\" says Hughes.\n\nThe fact that this vastly simplified simulation backed up earlier experiments indicates that even in liquids as complex as whisky, it may be enough just to understand how the alcohol mixes with the water.\n\nHowever, Hughes points out that the mixing behaviour changes depending on the shape of the container. The simulation used a box-shaped vessel, and it's hard to say whether guaiacol would behave the same way in a flask, a mug or an antique crystal decanter.\n\nOf course, how you take your whisky is a matter of taste, whatever science may have to say. \"Sometimes I add water, and sometimes I don't.

According to CNN News, adding water is the best way to drink whiskey even though those who try the mix can find themselves the object of derision.\n\nSome dedicated whiskey drinkers at your local bar may insist that the grain-based alcohol should be taken neat, but many serious whiskey aficionados have for long been in favor of the on-the-rocks version. In Ireland, it's also common in the cold, damp, winter months to warm up with a hot whiskey. The popular hot drink is made with whiskey, hot water, lemon, sugar, and cloves, and for the Irish, it might be considered the best way to drink whiskey when it's cold out.\n\nA new study published in nature.com's scientific reports section shone a light on what exactly makes the difference when whiskey and water go together. The authors of the study took a close look at the contents of those specially-designed whiskey glasses and examined the molecular chemistry of the golden liquor.\n\nA molecule called guaiacol is the invisible ingredient in every rich sip that changes the taste experience when it reacts to water. Guaiacol gives the smokiness that's so closely associated with the taste of whiskey, and it has one part that likes water, and one that dislikes water. Under different concentrations of H2O, the potency of the molecule changes, and that affects the depth of taste.\n\nThe ratio of water to alcohol in your glass of whiskey is essential to achieving exactly the right taste. More water pushes the smoky guaiacol to the top of the glass, and that means the enhanced flavor is right where your taste buds and sense of smell will find it. According to The Verge, the best way to drink whiskey happens when the magic number is 40-45 percent alcohol, which is achieved with bottled whiskey by adding a small amount of water.\n\nWhiskey in the cask has a much higher alcohol concentration and can be dangerous to drink neat. If you toss back too much cask-strength whiskey, which is at least 59 percent alcohol content, you can end up damaging your esophagus as the whiskey burns its way down.\n\nFor those wondering whether whisky and whiskey are the same thing, the travel blog, travelandleisure.com, explained that the difference is far more than a disagreement over one letter. Whisky is distilled in Scotland, Canada, and Japan, while whiskey is produced in Ireland and the United States.\n\nBoth words have their origin in the Scottish and Irish Gaelic language. Uisge-beatha is the Scottish Gaelic name for the amber alcohol, while Uisce beatha is the Irish version. In both languages, the literal translation is \"water of life.\"\n\nIf whiskey (or whisky) is the water of life, than clearly the best way to drink it is with added water, but not everyone agrees. There's even an old Scottish air called, \"She's Sweetest When She's Naked,\" that refers not to a beautiful woman, but to whisky. Whisky or whiskey with no water or ice added is known as \"neat\" or \"naked.\"\n\n[Featured Image by by Charles McQuillan/Getty Images]", "id": "9776379", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The Best Way To Drink Whiskey Really Is Hot Whiskey And Whiskey On The Rocks", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Irish-whiskey.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "37", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "113", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "84296", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": null, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "112932", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sugar"}, "id": "303411", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}, "id": "304269", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Blog"}, "id": "305393", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Esophagus"}, "id": "307600", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esophagus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barrel"}, "id": "310652", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distilled beverage"}, "id": "324694", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amber"}, "id": "327131", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Scottish Gaelic"}, "id": "328480", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Irish language"}, "id": "343754", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste bud"}, "id": "384384", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_bud"}, {"label": {"eng": "Soviet submarine S-363"}, "id": "475199", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_submarine_S-363"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 525, "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Beverages", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Beverages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 708, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Water Polo", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Water_Polo"}], "time": "21:01:00"}

In particular, the nature of the interaction between the solvent and taste-carrying molecules, such as guaiacol, is not known. To address this gap, we used MD simulations to study the distribution of guaiacol in water-alcohol mixtures of different concentrations. Our simulations revealed that guaiacol is present at the air-liquid interface at ethanol concentrations that correspond to the alcohol content of bottled or diluted whiskies. Because the drink is consumed at the interface first, our findings help to understand why adding water to whisky helps to enhance its taste. A molecular understanding of the nature of taste compounds in water-alcohol mixtures allows for optimizing the taste of alcoholic spirits.

The taste of whisky is primarily associated with amphipathic molecules, such as guaiacol, but why and how dilution enhances the taste is not well understood. We carried out computer simulations of water-ethanol mixtures in the presence of guaiacol, providing atomistic details on the structure of the liquid mixture. We found that guaiacol is preferentially associated with ethanol, and, therefore, primarily found at the liquid-air interface in mixtures that contain up to 45 vol-% of ethanol. At ethanol concentrations of 59 vol-% or higher, guaiacol is increasingly surrounded by ethanol molecules and is driven to the bulk. This indicates that the taste of guaiacol in the whisky would be enhanced upon dilution prior to bottling. Our findings may apply to other flavour-giving amphipathic molecules and could contribute to optimising the production of spirits for desired tastes. Furthermore, it sheds light on the molecular structure of water-alcohol mixtures that contain small solutes, and reveals that interactions with the water may be negligible already at 89 vol-% of ethanol.\n\nWhisky is a spirit that is produced in an extended process consisting of distillation of fermented grains, ageing and dilution. It is through this process that the distinctive taste of whisky develops. Distilled malt whiskies typically contain around 70% alcohol by volume (vol-%) before it is aged in barrels for at least three years. Some alcohol evaporates during the maturation resulting in an alcohol content of 55-65 vol-% of cask-strength whisky. Before bottling, the whisky is diluted to around 40 vol-% by the addition of water, which changes the taste significantly. Whisky enthusiasts often also add a few drops of water to the spirit before drinking in order to further enhance the taste. Apart from water and alcohols, whiskies contain different organic compounds that contribute to their taste. Many whiskies, especially those that are made on the Scottish island of Isley, have a typical smoky taste that develops when malted barley is smoked on peat fire. Chemically, the smoky flavour is attributed to phenols, and in particular guaiacol, which is much more common in Scottish whiskies than in American or Irish ones. Guaiacol is a small and mostly hydrophobic molecule that is able to interact with polar solvents via hydrogen-bonding and polar-aromatic interactions. Higher concentrations of guaiacol have been found in Scottish whiskies than in American and Irish ones. The concentration of guaiacol was found by GC/MS to be 3.7-4.1\u2009mg\u2009L, or about 3.2\u00b710\u2009M in two undisclosed Scottish whiskies. It is likely that the concentration of guaiacol in Isley whiskies is even higher. Yet, how diluting whisky with water affects its taste is not clear.\n\nSpectroscopic studies have previously revealed that alcohol and water undergo incomplete mixing. Concentration-dependent variations in the liquid structure were evident from ultrasonic measurements and X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies of water-alcohol mixtures. Further investigations suggested that the behaviour of such mixtures could be divided into three regions of low, middle and high molar fraction of alcohol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that water and short-chain alcohols in liquid mixtures separate into clusters. The dynamics of these clusters was first studied by MD and non-equilibrium simulations, revealing that such clusters do not move by collective diffusion. Recently, vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical analysis showed that aggregation of short chain alcohols in mixtures that contain up to 4\u2009M alcohol in water are, by and large, a random process. Simulations of surface interfaces of water-ethanol mixtures have also been performed in the past and shed light on the structure and dynamics of the alcohol-air interface and on the mixing of alcohol and water in the presence of an additional surface. Simulations and potential of mean force calculations of droplets of water-alcohol mixtures showed a clear preference of the alcohols to the air-water interface, which was shown to be primarily an enthalpic effect. Furthermore, decomposition of the solvation energy of ions and non-polar solutes at the solvent-air interface was performed by applying linear response theory. Interestingly, alkyl-halides were also shown to be adsorbed at the air-water interface, where they were partially solvated by water.\n\nDespite the growing knowledge of the nature of water-alcohol mixtures on a molecular level, much less is known on the interaction of water, alcohol and small solutes. In particular, the nature of the interaction between the solvent and taste-carrying molecules, such as guaiacol, is not known. To address this gap, we used MD simulations to study the distribution of guaiacol in water-alcohol mixtures of different concentrations. Our simulations revealed that guaiacol is present at the air-liquid interface at ethanol concentrations that correspond to the alcohol content of bottled or diluted whiskies. Because the drink is consumed at the interface first, our findings help to understand why adding water to whisky helps to enhance its taste. A molecular understanding of the nature of taste compounds in water-alcohol mixtures allows for optimizing the taste of alcoholic spirits. Moreover, such an understanding can contribute to the development of stock solution drug formulations. Indeed, guaiacol is one of the active compounds in a pharmaceutically active anti-cough oral solution, Pulmo Bailley\u00ae, in a mixture with water and a short polyol alcohol (glycerol).", "id": "9737364", "details": {"liCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Dilution of whisky - the molecular perspective", "image": "https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-017-06423-5/MediaObjects/41598_2017_6423_Fig1_HTML.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Solution"}, "id": "303226", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smoking (cooking)"}, "id": "305369", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid"}, "id": "305550", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Properties of water"}, "id": "309678", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Solvent"}, "id": "309684", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvent"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Organic compound"}, "id": "319149", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barley"}, "id": "330296", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hydrophobe"}, "id": "397470", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phenols"}, "id": "439954", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenols"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecular dynamics"}, "id": "464026", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Amphiphile"}, "id": "479916", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiphile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hydrogen bond"}, "id": "495874", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 274, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 275, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse"}], "time": "16:51:00"}

At the end of the day, though, you might argue that De gustibus non est disputandum, and leave the snobs with a hanging upper lip.\n\nBut if science is truly the best tool we have for objective inquiry, then adding at least a couple drops of water to your glass of amber liquor really ought to improve the experience. According to a pair of biochemists in Sweden water molecules interact with flavor molecules found in whiskey, an interplay that ultimately enriches the taste of the drink.\n\nSpecifically, water molecules interact with flavor molecules called phenols. Smokey blends such as those famously sourced from the Scottish island of Islay are particularly rich in a specific phenol called guaiacol.\n\nWhen water is present, guaiacol hops along and rises with the H2O to the air-liquid interface. It's at this interface, basically the drink's surface, that the whiskey is consumer first and thus it makes sense that adding at least a bit of water to whiskey helps enhance its taste.\n\nThe findings suggest that the alcohol content has a big word to say. When ethanol concentration in the whiskey was less than 45%, guaiacol was found near the surface of the liquid. The molecules were driven further down into the solution the concentration exceeded 59% though. Previously, spectroscopic studies have previously revealed that alcohol and water undergo incomplete mixing which might explain this behaviour.\n\nDistillers add water to their whiskey anyway, we have to say. The spirit is essentially made by distilling fermented grains like barley or rye. Distilled malt whiskeys typically contain around 70% alcohol by volume (vol-%) before it is aged in barrels for at least three years. This maturation lowers the alcohol content but the concentration is still strong hovering at 55-65 vol-%. Distillers then add water before bottling until a stable 40% alcohol is reached, which not only alters the intoxication potency but also the taste.\n\n\"Our findings ...could contribute to optimising the production of spirits for desired tastes,\" Bjorn Karlsson and Ran Friedman of Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden reported in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nAt this point, it should be noted that their findings are based on computer simulations of the complex chemical interplay of H2O and flavor molecules.

While some might have a John Wayne instinct to drink it neat, the real aficionados know that adding a few drops of water to the drink can improve and expand its flavour profile. Now, in the great whiskey war of whether or not one should add water, some chemists have chosen a side: they say yes, you should add water to your whiskey.\n\nAccording to a new study published today in Scientific Reports, diluting whiskey can indeed improve the drink's taste. While many people have anecdotally sworn by this trick, researchers from Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry in Sweden have now revealed the science behind it.\n\nIn their research, chemists Bj\u00f6rn Karlsson and Ran Friedman carefully examined a molecule in whiskey called guaiacol, which gives whiskey its unmistakable smokey flavour and scent. After running computer simulations of various water and ethanol mixtures, the researchers found that ethanol content greatly affected how guaiacol behaved.\n\nAt concentrations of ethanol above 59 per cent, guaiacol was mixed throughout the drink and away from the surface. which is about the content the authors found that ethanol interacts more strongly with guaiacol, which means the molecule is driven into the solution away from the surface. But at ethanol concentrations of 45 per cent, ethanol clustered at the surface of the drink, along with guaiacol.

When it comes to whiskey, a touch of dilution improves the solution. Diluting your whiskey with water makes it more flavorful, especially if it's Scotch.\n\nThe reason is guaiacol, an aromatic oil that gives the liquor its signature smoky flavor. Guaiacol is present in guaiacum, a kind of slow-growing shrub with pretty purple flowers, and, as relates to whiskey, the compound is also present in something called wood creosote.\n\nTo make whiskey, distillers create a mash, or fermented alcohol solution from a mixture of grains, yeast and water. If you've ever wondered what, besides spelling, separates American whiskey from Irish whiskey and Scottish whisky, the answer is (at least in part) the ingredients. Broadly speaking, American whiskey (also called bourbon) is usually made from corn; Irish whiskey from a blend of malted and regular barley; Scottish whiskey (Scotch) from only malted barley. After the mash is made with its respective grain, whiskey makers pour it in distillers, or special containers that boil off the methanol -- alcohol that famously makes humans go blind. That leaves behind ethanol, the alcohol that we think of as, well, alcohol, along with the flavors of the original mash. The remaining liquid is put to age in charred oak barrels, which is where scotch gains it's guaiacol. Charring wood creates wood creosote, so as the liquid interacts with the barrel's walls, guaiacol migrates into the liquor.\n\nScotch tends to have more guaiacol than other whiskies because it's made from malted barley, or barley that's been soaked in water to make it germinate and then heated to stop that germination. In the case of whisky from the Scottish island of Isley, the barley is smoked on peat fire. Both steps add a bit more guaiacol to the mix.\n\nUnless you're drinking your whiskey through a bendy straw, you're sipping from what's known as the liquid-air interface -- the top. But when whiskey is more than 50 percent alcohol, as is the case with some of the finer varieties, guaiacol tends to hang out deep in the glass. Adding a bit of water moves guaiacol closer to the surface, where you can better smell and taste it, creating a more satisfactory flavor.\n\nIt would be great if researchers from Linn\u00e6us University in Sweden had come to this conclusion by simply drinking lots of whiskey, but instead they ran computational models to study the distribution of guaiacol in water-alcohol mixtures of different concentrations. They found that alcohol doesn't actually love mixing with water. At lower alcohol levels, it moves close to the top of the glass. But as alcohol concentration increases, the alcohol molecules clump together to form bigger, denser clusters. Those clusters tend to move to the bottom of your drink, away from your taste buds. As it's the alcohol that contains the guaiacol, this southern migration takes the flavor along with it. Of course, some might argue that the test is in the tasting.", "id": "9764769", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Chemists confirm that whiskey really does taste better with a splash of water", "image": "http://www.popsci.com/sites/popsci.com/files/styles/medium_1x_/public/images/2017/08/toc_whiskey-1024x748.png?itok=1kxeRE5Y", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maize"}, "id": "303409", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smoking (cooking)"}, "id": "305369", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wood"}, "id": "307585", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt"}, "id": "316533", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shrub"}, "id": "317388", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bourbon whiskey"}, "id": "322662", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distilled beverage"}, "id": "324694", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oak"}, "id": "329445", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barley"}, "id": "330296", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carl Linnaeus"}, "id": "332715", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"}, {"label": {"eng": "Peat"}, "id": "333899", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Yeast"}, "id": "338156", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeast"}, {"label": {"eng": "Methanol"}, "id": "353862", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 274, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 275, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse"}], "time": "18:30:00"}

While many people have anecdotally sworn by this trick, researchers from Linnaeus University Center for Biomaterials Chemistry in Sweden have now revealed the science behind it.\n\nIn their research, chemists Bj\u00f6rn Karlsson and Ran Friedman carefully examined a molecule in whiskey called guaiacol, which gives whiskey its unmistakable smokey flavor and scent. After running computer simulations of various water and ethanol mixtures, the researchers found that ethanol content greatly affected how guaiacol behaved.\n\nAt concentrations of ethanol above 59 percent, guaiacol was mixed throughout the drink and away from the surface. which is about the content the authors found that ethanol interacts more strongly with guaiacol, which means the molecule is driven into the solution away from the surface. But at ethanol concentrations of 45 percent, ethanol clustered at the surface of the drink, along with guaiacol. This would hypothetically allow the drinker to better take in the nightmarish aroma and flavor of the beverage.\n\nHonestly, you should drink whiskey however you want.

Whisky enthusiasts have long disagreed about how the amber nectar is best enjoyed, but now a scientific paper has backed the idea that diluting whisky can enhance its flavour.\n\nThe work suggests that adding water boosts the concentration of flavour compounds at the surface of the drink, helping to unleash the rich mix of aromas.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Karlsson, a chemist at Linn\u00e6us University in Sweden and the paper's co-author, said: \"What came out from our study is that adding water to whisky should make it taste better.\"\n\nKarlsson and his co-author, Ran Friedman, had come across the idea that adding water to whisky improved the taste and aroma. \"Neither of us are big whisky drinkers,\" he said. \"But we were interested in the chemistry.\"\n\nTo investigate why adding water could intensify flavour, rather than the reverse, they developed a simple computational model to look at the interactions of water, ethanol - whisky's two basic ingredients - and a flavour compound called guaiacol that comes from the charred oak casks used to mature Scotch and has a characteristically sweet, smoky flavour.\n\nDespite including just three chemicals, Karlsson said the interplay is fairly complex. One end of the ethanol molecule is attracted to water, while the other end is repelled. This means that at very low concentrations, ethanol accumulates at the surface, where molecules can roughly align themselves in their preferred direction, with the water-repelling side facing upwards towards the air.\n\nAbove a certain concentration, the ethanol cannot all fit at the surface and so it escapes down into the bulk of the liquid, but still clusters into pockets. The guaiacol is more strongly attracted to the ethanol than the water meaning that the alcohol concentration determines how much of it is found near the top of the glass.\n\nIn the distillery, cask strength whisky, which can be more than 60% alcohol by volume, is typically diluted to 40-45%.\n\nThe new paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, showed that diluting a whisky from 45% to 27% boosted the density of guaiacol at the surface by more than one third. Other flavour compounds are known to have similar behaviours, Karlsson said, meaning that the findings could explain the benefits of adding water.\n\nKarlsson said that bottling a whisky at a higher concentration than is optimal in terms of taste also made sense because this would help prevent flavour compounds escaping into the bottle's headspace, where they would waft away on opening.\n\nMatthew Pauley, an assistant professor at the International Centre for Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, said he would like to see the findings put to a taste test to see whether the model could predict the exact sweet spot for dilution. Pauley said that to \"take apart\" a whisky's taste, he favoured the industry standard of diluting to 20%. \"It's all very well doing it on a computational model,\" he said. \"I'm not pooh-poohing the results, but I'd like to do the test.\"\n\nPauley said that scientific research on whiskies was welcome as it helped strip away \"pretentious\" myths about the drink. \"It's about breaking down the barriers and saying 'we do this because of X, Y or Z',\" he said.\n\nDavid Williamson, of the Scotch Whisky Association, said that adding water also helps prevent an overwhelming taste of alcohol masking more delicate, complex flavours. \"The other factor is ... reducing the alcohol sensation on the nose and tongue,\" he said.\n\nKarlsson said he and colleagues had not yet put the findings to a taste test, but added that, having turned 40 recently, he now had an ample selection of Japanese and Scotch whiskies to work with. \"After this attention we've got, it seems like I'm more or less forced to drink it,\" he said.", "id": "9699669", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Whisky (and water) galore: scientists conclude dilution enhances flavour", "image":

They are right - and researchers have discovered why.\n\nTrue whiskey lovers have known it all along: A few drops of water in the drink and the flavor will come out much better. However, until now nobody knew why this was. Two biochemists solved the mystery: Bj\u00f6rn Karlsson and Ran Friedman from the Linnaeus University Centre for Biomaterials Chemistry in the Swedish city of Kalmar discovered that water makes a specific aromatic substance reach its full potential at the surface of the liquid. They published their findings on August 17th 2017 in the journal \"Scientific Reports.\"\n\nThe production of whiskey involves several steps: Similar to the brewing of beer, it starts with a mash made of malt. It ferments in a kettle when yeast is added. It is then distilled up to twice. The distillate holds about 70 percent of alcohol in the end.\n\nIn the next step, the distillers fill it into wooden kegs, where it sits while the alcohol level gradually drops down to about 55 to 65 percent. In the end, the distillers dilute the whiskey with water to bring the alcohol concentration to about 40 percent for bottling.\n\nThe smokey taste comes from the wood\n\nThe taste of the whiskey depends on a variety of factors: The malt, the mash, the timing and temperature of fermentation. But probably one of the most important aspects is the quality of the wooden barrels. They are responsible for adding a key flavor to the liquid: A phenol molecule called guaiacol.\n\nThis aromatic substance develops in the wood, where bacteria or temperature lead to the reduction of lignin - the material which makes wood sturdy. Also in smoked foods guaiacol is responsible for the flavor - or in fine wines with a specific taste of cork.\n\nNeither too little nor too much\n\nThe scientists simulated at the computer how guaiacol, water and alcohol interact at different alcohol concentrations. They found out, that up to an alcohol concentration of 45 percent, the guaiacol moves primarily to the upper level of the glass, close to where the liquid meets the air. There it displays it's fullest flavor and taste.\n\nToo much alcohol in the drink can spoil the flavor: Above 59 percent, the guaiacol will sink in the glass. This is why it is advised to add some water to fine whiskeys.\n\nBut be careful and don't overdo it: There is a fine balance between enhancing the taste and ruining it.", "id": "9699156", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Aromatic substances: Whiskey tastes better when diluted with water | Science | DW | 17.08.2017", "image": "http://www.dw.com/image/40135446_304.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 657, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 673}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Kalmar"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "95760", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar", "label": {"eng": "Kalmar"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}, "id": "302525", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wine"}, "id": "302906", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Temperature"}, "id": "303229", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}, "id": "303484", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Beer"}, "id": "303938", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Smoking (cooking)"}, "id": "305369", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Liquid"}, "id": "305550", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wood"}, "id": "307585", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brewing"}, "id": "309496", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Redox"}, "id": "310565", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malt"}, "id": "316533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Phenol"}, "id": "320389", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}, "id": "329000", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 274, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 275, "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse"}], "time": "13:13:00"}

It resembles other compounds such as vanillin (a compound that tastes like vanilla).\n\nThe study published in the journal Scientific Reports was conducted to simulate what happens to guaiacol in different concentrations of water.\n\nSince water and ethanol don't mix that well drinks contain clusters of ethanol, which trap aromatic compounds such as guaiacol, hampering what the drink should ideally taste like.\n\nWhisky is distilled at concentrations of alcohol above 59 percent. But whiskeys like Jack Daniels come bottled at a dilution of 40 to 45 percent where the ethanol and guaiacol accumulate at the surface.\n\nSince the taste, smell and flavour of your drink go hand-in-hand and the fact that the right amount of water is what is needed to enhance the flavour, it makes you wonder why whiskey isn't manufactured at lower concentrations?", "id": "9890695", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "The Best Way To Drink Whiskey Is To Dilute It With Water According To Science!", "image": "http://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2017/Aug/fb_text_1503054542_800x420.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "198", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Water"}, "id": "303000", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"}, {"label": {"eng": "Drink"}, "id": "304500", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink"}, {"label": {"eng": "Taste"}, "id": "306420", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}, "id": "307432", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Distillation"}, "id": "307605", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distillation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Molecule"}, "id": "308839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule"}, {"label": {"eng": "Whisky"}, "id": "309361", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky"}, {"label": {"eng": "Olfaction"}, "id": "311250", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfaction"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vanilla"}, "id": "311933", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla"}, {"label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}, "id": "315028", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol"}, {"label": {"eng": "Flavor"}, "id": "325216", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aromaticity"}, "id": "361850", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromaticity"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vanillin"}, "id": "381385", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanillin"}, {"label": {"eng": "Linnaeus University"}, "id": "851486", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linnaeus_University"}, {"label": {"eng": "Guaiacol"}, "id": "1024643", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaiacol"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 120, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Drink"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 525, "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Beverages", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Beverages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 895, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Environmental Chemistry", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Environmental_Chemistry"}], "time": "12:20:00"}

Some people swear by drinks on the rocks, others won't touch anything that's not neat.\n\nBut one group of scientists have now published a paper that lends some reasoning to adding at least a few drops of water to your whiskey. According to their paper, diluting the whiskey and lowering the alcohol content enhances the smell and taste, which -- assuming you're sipping and not taking shots -- is good news.\n\nThe research, published in Scientific Reports, focused on the interaction of one molecule, guaiacol, which is responsible for whiskey's smokey taste. The research found that due to the interaction between water, ethanol, and guaiacol, diluting your whiskey with water pushes more of the guaiacol molecules to the surface. That means they'll hit your tongue and nose first, enhancing the taste and smell.\n\nHow much water should you add? Whiskey preferences are personal, paper co-author Bjorn Karlsson told NPR.

Distilled malt whiskies typically contain around 70 percent alcohol before being aged in oak barrels for at least three years.\n\nMaturation reduces the alcohol content by 5 to 15 percent, But that is still far too high for optimal drinking pleasure, so the whisky's alcohol content is further diluted to around 40 percent before bottling by adding water.\n\nAt least one famous connoisseur, Winston Churchill, has suggested that the scientists may have gotten things backwards in their findings.\n\n\"When I was a young subaltern in the South African War, the water was not fit to drink,\" Britain's

Some people swear by drinks on the rocks, others won't touch anything that's not neat.\n\nBut one group of scientists have now published a paper that lends some reasoning to adding at least a few drops of water to your whiskey. According to their paper, diluting the whiskey and lowering the alcohol content enhances the smell and taste, which -- assuming you're sipping and not taking shots -- is good news.\n\nThe research, published in Scientific Reports, focused on the interaction of one molecule, guaiacol, which is responsible for whiskey's smokey taste. The research found that due to the interaction between water, ethanol and guaiacol, diluting your whiskey with water pushes more of the guaiacol molecules to the surface. That means they'll hit your tongue and nose first, enhancing the taste and smell.\n\nHow much water should you add? Whiskey preferences are personal, paper co-author Bjorn Karlsson told NPR. It's \"very hard to say something in general.\" Conventional wisdom would say somewhere between a few drops and one ice cube is a good place to start, but you'll have to fine-tune your own personal preferences.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306420", "label": {"eng": "Taste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307432", "label": {"eng": "Alcohol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308839", "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "308986", "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309361", "label": {"eng": "Whisky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309698", "label": {"eng": "Concentration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315028", "label": {"eng": "Ethanol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Reports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315166", "label": {"eng": "Scientific Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_by_volume", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329000", "label": {"eng": "Alcohol by volume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "331004", "label": {"eng": "Thermostat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-news_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "345033", "label": {"eng": "All-news radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartending_terminology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "396658", "label": {"eng": "Bartending terminology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_Labs", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "426200", "label": {"eng": "Nest Labs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaiacol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1024643", "label": {"eng": "Guaiacol"}}]}], "totalResults": 78, "pages": 78}}}

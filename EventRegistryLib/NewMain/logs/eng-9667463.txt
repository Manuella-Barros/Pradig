It's clean and ready to rock the solstice.", "body": "LONDON -- Stonehenge monuments that have stood for thousands of years appear unscathed after climate protesters were arrested for spraying orange paint on them, an official said Thursday.\n\nWorkers cleaned the stones and the roughly 4,500-year-old monument was visibly undamaged, said Nick Merriman, the chief executive of English Heritage.\n\n\"It's difficult to understand and we're deeply saddened,\" Merriman told BBC Radio 4. \"It's vandalism to one of the world's most celebrated ancient monuments.\"\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Site site reopened and was expected to host thousands of revelers celebrating the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, early Friday.\n\nStonehenge was built on a windswept plain in southern England in stages starting 5,000 years ago. Its origin and purpose remain somewhat of a mystery though the stone circle aligns with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset, drawing crowds of spiritualists, druids and sun worshippers.\n\nA 73-year-old man and 21-year-old woman were released on bail Thursday after being arrested a day earlier on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity.\n\nThe climate change activism group Just Stop Oil took responsibility for the act Wednesday and released video showing a man it identified as Rajan Naidu blast a fog of orange from a fire extinguisher at one of the vertical stones.\n\nPeople gathered at the site could be heard yelling \"stop\" and one person intervened, running up to Naidu and grabbing his arm. As the person struggled to pull him away from the monument, another man joined the tussle and and wrestled the paint can free.\n\nThe second protester, identified as Niamh Lynch, 21, managed to spray three stones before she was stopped.\n\nJust Stop Oil said the paint was made of cornstarch and would dissolve in the rain.\n\nMerriman said experts cleaned the orange powder from the stones because they were concerned about how it might react to water.\n\nThe publicity stunt was among a long line of disruptive acts by Just Stop Oil to draw attention to the climate crisis. The protests have halted sporting events, sullied famous works of art and caused traffic jams. The acts have led to convictions, jail terms and widespread criticism.\n\nCrime-courts Climate protesters arrested after defacing beloved Stonehenge monument with orange paint BRIAN MELLEY Associated Press\n\nThe Stonehenge demonstration was swiftly condemned by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who called it a \"disgraceful act of vandalism.\" His main opponent in the election next month, Labour leader Keir Starmer, called the group \"pathetic\" and said the damage was \"outrageous.\"\n\nThe group struck again Friday when it took credit for spray painting private jets at an airport outside London.

Its origin and purpose remain somewhat of a mystery though the stone circle aligns with the summer solstice sunrise and winter solstice sunset, drawing crowds of spiritualists, druids and sun worshippers.\n\nA 73-year-old man and 21-year-old woman were released on bail Thursday after being arrested a day earlier on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity.\n\nThe climate change activism group Just Stop Oil took responsibility for the act Wednesday and released video showing a man it identified as Rajan Naidu blast a fog of orange from a fire extinguisher at one of the vertical stones.\n\nPeople gathered at the site could be heard yelling \"stop\" and one person intervened, running up to Naidu and grabbing his arm. As the person struggled to pull him away from the monument, another man joined the tussle and and wrestled the paint can free.\n\nThe second protester, identified as Niamh Lynch, 21, managed to spray three stones before she was stopped.\n\nJust Stop Oil said the paint was made of cornstarch and would dissolve in the rain.\n\nMerriman said experts cleaned the orange powder from the stones because they were concerned about how it might react to water.\n\nThe publicity stunt was among a long line of disruptive acts by Just Stop Oil to draw attention to the climate crisis. The protests have halted sporting events, sullied famous works of art and caused traffic jams. The acts have led to convictions, jail terms and widespread criticism.\n\nThe Stonehenge demonstration was swiftly condemned by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who called it a \"disgraceful act of vandalism.\" His main opponent in the election next month, Labour leader Keir Starmer, called the group \"pathetic\" and said the damage was \"outrageous.\"\n\nThe group struck again Friday when it took credit for spray painting private jets at an airport outside London.

As people yelled at them to stop, they unleashed canisters of orange substances as several of the ancient stones were covered in the bright colour.\n\nThe two protesters were unveiled as Rajan Naidu, 73, and Niamh Lynch, 21. Naidu is believed to be a Quaker from Birmingham while the younger campaigner is a youth representative at the British Trust for Ornithology and an officer from the Oxford University's Nature Conservation Society. Wiltshire Police have today revealed the arrested pair were released on bail. They said in a statement: \"This is to allow us additional time to work with specialists and progress our inquiries.\n\n\"A man in his 70s and a woman in her 20s were arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, damaging an ancient monument and deterring a person from engaging in a lawful activity. It follows reports that an orange substance had been sprayed on some of the stones by two suspects. We also continue to work closely with English Heritage.\"\n\nEnglish Heritage chief executive Dr Nick Merriman said this morning there does not appear to be \"visible damage\" to Stonehenge. Dr Merriman told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"It's difficult to understand and we're deeply saddened about this vandalism, but we've been really touched by the messages of sympathy and support we've had.\n\n\"Our experts have already managed to clean the orange powder from the stones because we were really worried about what would happen if they got in contact with water. So far, there seems to be no visible damage. The site is open to the public again and for the solstice tomorrow.\n\n\"It's vandalism to one of the world's most celebrated ancient monuments. We wish people would channel their protests away from cultural heritage sites, museums and galleries because we feel that doesn't actually help their cause, and causes huge upset and disruption to the operation of these important sites.\"\n\nIn an earlier statement, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson explained: \"The UK's government in waiting has committed to enacting Just Stop Oil's original demand of 'no new oil and gas'. However, we all know this is not enough. Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything. That's why Just Stop Oil is demanding that our next government sign up to a legally binding treaty to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.\n\n\"Failure to commit to defending our communities will mean Just Stop Oil supporters, along with citizens from Austria, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland will join in resistance this summer, if their own Governments do not take meaningful action. Stone circles can be found in every part of Europe showing how we've always cooperated across vast distances - we're building on that legacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

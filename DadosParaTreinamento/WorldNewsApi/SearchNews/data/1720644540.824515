The poll by Redfield and Wilton, conducted for The Independent, surveyed 2,000 adults on Wednesday and Thursday and showed 19 per cent of people think Mr Farage should take over from Mr Sunak, with 22 per cent of 2019 Conservative voters surveyed agreeing. The poll offered six other names \u2013 Penny Mordaunt (15 per cent), James Cleverly (6 per cent), Kemi Badenoch (5 per cent), Suella Braverman (4 per cent), Priti Patel (2 per cent) and Robert Jenrick (1 per cent). The largest proportion (48 per cent) of those surveyed said they did not know who should replace Mr Sunak as leader of the Conservatives. To add to the worrying polls for the Tories, 37 per cent of people surveyed said the Reform UK party should replace the Conservatives as the major opposition to Labour, with 30 per cent disagreeing. The poll also found that 45 per cent of all voters believe Labour will win the next two elections with just 19 per cent disagreeing. But the poll said 49 per cent of those surveyed believe the main reason for a Labour victory in the UK general election would be because of \u201cTory failures\u201d. The poll found 18 per cent of people said Labour policies would lead the party to victory, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership got 14 per cent of the vote. The result comes after Ms Mordaunt branded the prime minister\u2019s decision to leave the D-Day 80th anniversary events early as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d during a BBC debate on Friday. Ms Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, said it was right that Mr Sunak apologised not only to veterans but to the public, although she added the issue should not become \u201ca political football\u201d. During the seven-way debate, the Commons Leader said: \u201cWhat happened was completely wrong, and the Prime Minister has rightly apologised for that, apologised to veterans but also to all of us, because he was representing all of us.\u201d", "summary": "The poll by Redfield and Wilton, which was conducted for The Independent, surveyed 2,000 adults.", "url": "https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/poll-suggests-nigel-farage-top-pick-to-succeed-rishi-sunak-as-tory-leader-1635363.html", "image": "https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDZcXFwvMDgxMjQ2MDdcXFwvMi43NjQxMjMwMS1lMTcxNzg0NzQ2MTYyNi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NzAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6Mz", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:31:25", "author": "BreakingNews.ie,Press Association", "authors": ["BreakingNews.ie", "Press Association"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.012}

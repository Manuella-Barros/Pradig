Sir Michael Stoute's trainee was well-backed for the feature contest on day two, after an impressive comeback at Chester. But the big meeting will come too soon for the Niarchos family-owned colt, following a health setback. Racing manager Alan Cooper said: \u201cHe has an infection and it would be a race against time to have him spot on for Ascot.\" On the Roodee last month, Passenger took the Group Two Huxley Stakes in comfortable fashion. Run at a distance of around 1m 2f, he was due to step back up to racing's top flight at the big meeting on June 19. With Richard Kingscote riding, the classy performer was last seen in a Group One race last summer, when finishing the Derby in 12th place behind Auguste Rodin. Aidan O'Brien's seven-time winner is now clear favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes, which the trainer won in 2021 with Love. Coral go 7-4 (from 3-1), with his Tattersalls Gold Cup conqueror White Birch next in at 11-4. \"Auguste Rodin has been well-backed for the Prince Of Wales's in recent days, while the likes of Horizon Dore and Alflaila have also attracted support, while Passenger had been friendless at the head of the betting,\" said spokesperson David Stevens. Cooper said Stoute will try and get Passenger back on track for the Coral Eclipse on July 6, won by his sire Ulysses in 2017. \"Hopefully he will be ready for the Eclipse, but that will be up to Sir Michael,\" he added. \u201cWe\u2019ll get the horse right first and then we will make a plan when everybody is happy.\u201d", "summary": "The Sir Michael Stoute-trained horse was the general 2-1 market leader for the Prince of Wales's Stakes on June 19.

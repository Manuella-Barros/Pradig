A new port is being built in the Gaza Strip ahead of a U.S. military-led operation to surge needed food and other aid into the besieged enclave as Israel's [...]\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- The building of a new port in the Gaza Strip ahead of a U.S. military-led operation to bring more desperately needed food and other aid into the besieged enclave as Israel's war on Hamas grinds on is well underway, according to satellite images analyzed Thursday by The Associated Press.\n\nThe construction appears to have been moving quickly over the last two weeks, judging from the images, and some officials say the port could become ready as early as a week from now.\n\nThe port sits just southwest of Gaza City, which once was the territory's most-populous area before the Israeli ground offensive rolled through, pushing over 1 million people south toward the town of Rafah on the Egyptian border. Its construction comes as Israel faces widespread international criticism over the slow trickle of aid into the area, where the United Nations says at least a quarter of the population sits on the brink of starvation.\n\nHowever, the site has already been targeted by a militant mortar attack, according to the Israeli military. An official from the Hamas militant group that has run Gaza since 2007 has warned that any foreign military presence at the pier would be target for attack -- potentially complicating the aid efforts even further.\n\nThe satellite pictures, taken by Planet Labs PBC, show that heavy construction at the site started over two weeks ago. The area sits just north of a road bisecting Gaza that the Israeli military built during the fighting.\n\nA U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes deliberations, said the port \"is directly at the end of the new road the IDF has put in place.\" The official used an acronym for the Israeli military.\n\nHeavy trucks and machinery could be seen in an image taken a week ago by Planet Labs, with the cleared area appearing even larger in an image taken Wednesday. A dirt berm separates the area from nearby buildings. Other details correspond to an on-the-ground image of the aid pier seen by the AP.\n\nThe port will likely have three zones -- one controlled by the Israelis where aid from the pier is dropped off, another where the aid will be transferred, and a third where Palestinian drivers contracted by the U.N. will wait to pick up the aid before bringing it to distribution points, the U.N. official said.\n\nStill, the official said several sticking points remain around how the Israelis would handle the port's security. The military is reportedly seeking to install remote-controlled gun positions, which the U.N. opposes.\n\nIsraeli officials have told the AP that Israel will play a part in security of the pier and moving some of the aid from the pier ashore, though the extent of the planned Israeli involvement remains unclear. Multiple Israeli government agencies did not respond to requests to comment about the port.\n\nA top Cyprus government official, who spoke to the AP on the customary condition of anonymity, said the pier \"will be ready by (end of) next week and we will begin (aid shipments) again.\" The official didn't specify when exactly shipments will begin.\n\nNavy officials confirmed to the AP what vessel tracking sites show: the USNS Benavidez, the American cargo ship that is carrying a lot of the larger equipment to build the pier, is now off the Gaza coast. Other army ships are either there or moving toward that area.\n\nConcerns still loom large -- the pier was attacked Wednesday, the U.N. official said, as four high-ranking U.N. officials were visiting the site. The military said the mortar fire from Gaza militants forced the officials to take shelter, but no one was killed or harmed.\n\nNo militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the assault.\n\nHowever, high-ranking Hamas political official Khalil al-Hayya has said the group would consider Israeli forces -- or forces from any other country -- stationed by the pier to guard it as \"an occupying force and aggression.\"\n\nThe port could be a game-changer as ramping up aid into Gaza through land crossings has proven challenging, with long backups of trucks awaiting Israeli inspections. Past efforts to get land in by sea faltered after an attack on a World Central Kitchen convoy carrying aid from a port to a warehouse in central Gaza left seven aid workers dead.\n\nCountries have even tried airdropping aid from the sky -- a tactic which aid groups say is a last-ditch resort because it can't deliver aid in large quantities and also has led to deaths.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press

Its construction comes as Israel faces widespread international criticism over the slow trickle of aid into the area, where the United Nations says at least a quarter of the population sits on the brink of starvation.\n\nHowever, the site has already been targeted by a militant mortar attack, according to the Israeli military. An official from the Hamas militant group that has run Gaza since 2007 has warned that any foreign military presence at the pier would be target for attack -- potentially complicating the aid efforts even further.\n\nThe satellite pictures, taken by Planet Labs PBC, show that heavy construction at the site started over two weeks ago. The area sits just north of a road bisecting Gaza that the Israeli military built during the fighting.\n\nA U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes deliberations, said the port \"is directly at the end of the new road the IDF has put in place.\" The official used an acronym for the Israeli military.\n\nHeavy trucks and machinery could be seen in an image taken a week ago by Planet Labs, with the cleared area appearing even larger in an image taken Wednesday. A dirt berm separates the area from nearby buildings. Other details correspond to an on-the-ground image of the aid pier seen by the AP.\n\nThe port will likely have three zones -- one controlled by the Israelis where aid from the pier is dropped off, another where the aid will be transferred, and a third where Palestinian drivers contracted by the U.N. will wait to pick up the aid before bringing it to distribution points, the U.N. official said.\n\nStill, the official said several sticking points remain around how the Israelis would handle the port's security. The military is reportedly seeking to install remote-controlled gun positions, which the U.N. opposes.\n\nIsraeli officials have told the AP that Israel will play a part in security of the pier and moving some of the aid from the pier ashore, though the extent of the planned Israeli involvement remains unclear. Multiple Israeli government agencies did not respond to requests to comment about the port.\n\nA top Cyprus government official, who spoke to the AP on the customary condition of anonymity, said the pier \"will be ready by (end of) next week and we will begin (aid shipments) again.\" The official didn't specify when exactly shipments will begin.\n\nNavy officials confirmed to the AP what vessel tracking sites show: the USNS Benavidez, the American cargo ship that is carrying a lot of the larger equipment to build the pier, is now off the Gaza coast. Other army ships are either there or moving toward that area.\n\nConcerns still loom large -- the pier was attacked Wednesday, the U.N. official said, as four high-ranking U.N. officials were visiting the site. The military said the mortar fire from Gaza militants forced the officials to take shelter, but no one was killed or harmed.\n\nNo militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the assault.\n\nHowever, high-ranking Hamas political official Khalil al-Hayya has said the group would consider Israeli forces -- or forces from any other country -- stationed by the pier to guard it as \"an occupying force and aggression.\"\n\nThe port could be a game-changer as ramping up aid into Gaza through land crossings has proven challenging, with long backups of trucks awaiting Israeli inspections. Past efforts to get land in by sea faltered after an attack on a World Central Kitchen convoy carrying aid from a port to a warehouse in central Gaza left seven aid workers dead.\n\nCountries have even tried airdropping aid from the sky -- a tactic which aid groups say is a last-ditch resort because it can't deliver aid in large quantities and also has led to deaths.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press

A ground invasion of the city, which Israel says is the final holdout of Hamas militants in Gaza, risks further disrupting the delivery of desperately needed food, drinking water and other essentials. The vast majority of humanitarian aid currently enters through two border crossings in southern Gaza.\n\nSome U.S. officials have said the pier, which will float several miles off Gaza's shore, will help get more aid into northern Gaza, where some residents are already living in famine-like conditions, according to estimates released last month by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an international initiative tasked with assessing the risk of famine around the world. Such deliveries will become even more crucial once Israel's expected Rafah offensive pushes more Gazans to flee once again, this time toward the north.\n\nThe Pentagon estimates that it will take U.S. troops 10 to 14 days to assemble the pier, but officials said it could take longer given the unusual challenges of building the pier as well as a floating causeway closer to the shore, without American military personnel ever setting foot in Gaza.\n\nHumanitarian aid will be loaded onto ships on the island of Cyprus and travel toward Gaza. Once the ships dock on the floating pier, the aid will be loaded onto smaller support vessels to take it to the causeway, from where aid groups will transport it into Gaza on nonmilitary trucks. The Israeli military will be responsible for securing the area around the pier.\n\nGaza's 2.2 million residents are experiencing some of the worst levels of hunger in the world. Food and other deliveries shrank to a fraction of their normal levels after Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks and Israel's subsequent military offensive. Health officials in Gaza say more than two dozen children have already died from malnutrition and dehydration. The U.N. and others warn that many more will follow if more humanitarian aid isn't allowed to enter the enclave.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza have said in interviews that they have eaten animal feed and plants, and drank dirty water that they boiled to survive.\n\nThe escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza has piled pressure on the Biden administration over its support for Israel, the U.S.'s foremost ally in the Middle East. Students have staged protests in support of Palestinians on the campuses of U.S. universities, and President Biden risks losing important swing states during the November election over concerns about his administration's Middle East policy among Democratic voters.\n\nBiden announced the U.S. plan to build a temporary pier during his March 7 State of the Union address. The proposed pier was a last-minute addition to the speech, defense officials said, and the Pentagon has been scrambling since to determine how to make the pier operational.\n\nThe U.S. and its Arab and European allies began ramping up humanitarian airdrops in March, but the efforts barely made a dent in Gaza's hunger crisis. Even the biggest airdrops rarely match the 16.5 tons of aid that just one typical truck carries into Gaza from Egypt at less than one-tenth of the cost. Witnesses have reported airdrops falling on Palestinians and killing them.\n\nMore than 34,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed since Oct. 7, according to Palestinian health authorities, whose numbers don't distinguish between combatants and civilians. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nAround 190 trucks on average a day have entered Gaza from two southern crossings so far this month, according to a U.N. tracker. The figures don't include several dozen trucks Israel that says have entered Gaza through a newly opened northern crossing.\n\nBefore the war, some 500 trucks entered Gaza every day.\n\nThe continued fighting, logistical challenges and movement restrictions imposed by Israel have impeded deliveries to people outside of Rafah of the limited humanitarian aid that enters Gaza. Several deadly incidents have also led to some humanitarian agencies to at times pause deliveries.\n\nU.S. defense officials say around 200 trucks' worth of aid a day could enter Gaza via the pier. There is already humanitarian aid in Cyprus that is set to be delivered through the pier, a former U.S. official said. The U.S. ships transporting the pier have also arrived in the region after weeks of travel, the Pentagon said.\n\nWrite to Nancy A.

According to several aid officials, the current plan is to anchor it not off northern Gaza, where the threat of famine is most severe, but at a point halfway up the strip where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have a stronghold.\n\nThat would mean that food aid brought in via the dock would still have to pass through an IDF checkpoint at the Netzarim corridor, a military road that bisects the strip, and which has been a choke-point stopping humanitarian deliveries reaching the north.\n\nSome UN and other humanitarian officials fear that the aid will be diverted south to camps set up for the more than 1 million people now sheltering in Rafah. The IDF wants them to move out so that it can conduct an offensive against Hamas units in Gaza's southernmost city.\n\nSuch an offensive would inevitably mean the temporary closure of Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings in southern Gaza, so the US-made floating dock would serve as a substitute, while at the same time diverting pressure on Israel to open northern crossing points to substantial aid traffic.\n\n\"One of the key arguments for having a dock was to put it further north so that suppliers could come in more directly to the north,\" a UN official said, adding that what was actually being proposed looked more like a \"smokescreen to enable the Israelis to invade Rafah\".\n\nWhen Biden announced the scheme as one of the highlights of his State of the Union speech on 7 March, he presented it as a decisive step in delivering food aid. \"This temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day,\" he said.\n\nA senior US official presented it at the time as a way of delivering food without having to use the IDF-run land crossings. \"We're not waiting on the Israelis,\" the official said.\n\nSince then, it has become clear that the IDF's monopoly over security in Gaza allowed the Israeli authorities to influence where the dock should be placed.\n\nThe IDF's bombing of an aid convoy in Gaza run by World Central Kitchen on 1 April, killing seven aid workers, had made security concerns a key obstacle to any form of independent distribution effort.\n\nThe US plan will involve a floating dock, anchored to the sea floor, where big ships will unload, and a floating 500-metre pier connected to the shore. Smaller vessels would transport cargo from the dock to the pier, where it would be loaded on to trucks for distribution. The ambition is for 200 trucks a day, carrying 2 million meals, to enter Gaza by this sea route.\n\nThe question of who should deliver food around Gaza had been argued over for some weeks before Friday, when the US humanitarian and development agency USAid announced an agreement with the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThe agreement was controversial within the UN as its agencies had previously agreed that all aid operations in Gaza should involve the Unrwa, the relief agency for Palestinian refugees across the region, which Israel is trying to sideline.\n\nIt was clear from the announcements on Friday that not everything had been worked out.\n\n\"Operational conversations continue with WFP to ensure safe and sustainable delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza in an independent, neutral, and impartial manner,\" a USAid spokesperson said. \"This is a complex operation that requires coordination between many partners, and our conversations are ongoing.\"\n\nThe WFP announcement was even more tentative. \"The UN has agreed to work with the US and other partners on the maritime corridor as an additional route for relief to Gaza, on the condition that humanitarian principles can be ensured and that land access is also expanded,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThe UN agencies are nervous about becoming too identified with an IDF mechanism for delivering aid.\n\n\"The perception that would be created of humanitarians operating alongside the IDF in any way, shape, or form, would be ruinous for the reputation of humanitarians in Gaza. We would be seen to be collaborating,\" a UN official said. \"It would of course have knock-on consequences in terms of our safety and acceptance inside of Gaza.\"\n\nStephen Morrison, senior vice-president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the UN was highly resistant to the idea, but that they were \"getting pushed and pulled\".\n\n\"What is unclear is: does this lead to the further degradation and marginalisation of Unrwa?\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a parallel scheme is being promoted by a private firm called Fogbow, made up of former US special forces, marines, CIA officers, a former diplomat, a former fund manager and a veteran UN aid official. Fogbow's plan, which it calls Blue Beach, involves three barges capable of carrying 175 trucks each, sailing direct from Cyprus to the Gaza coast.\n\nThe Fogbow barges would come ashore close to the US pier and the Israeli security perimeter but on the north side of the Netzarim corridor. The company is looking to partner with Palestinian businesses, including the Palestinian entrepreneur Bashar al Masri, to help warehouse food and distribute deliveries.\n\nFogbow was formed in 2022 with the idea of providing privately run humanitarian relief in difficult or hostile environments. The idea was shelved in 2023 but revived after the Gaza war broke out in October and the humanitarian situation in the strip became disastrous.\n\nWhile Gaza would be Fogbow's first venture, it believes its team has deep experience of logistics in extreme circumstances.\n\n\"These are folks who are rugged American types who feel that they can deal with the Israelis, to the Israeli inspectors, they can deal with the Palestinians, they can talk to the Cypriots, they can organise shipping and they can tie in with the US,\" Morrison said.\n\nFogbow has set up a fundraising arm in Geneva, called Maritime Humanitarian Aid Foundation and run by another former US diplomat, Cameron Hume. The team has been touring world capitals looking for backing and believes it has pledges of support from the Gulf monarchies and Europe.\n\nSeveral of the Fogbow team were stationed in Israel during their government service and are now seeking to leverage their relationships within the IDF to set up a privately run sea corridor. They could also take over the running of the US floating dock and pier when the US forces leave.\n\nThe existence of a privatised sea route would provide Israel with an alternative to dealing with Unrwa or the Palestinian Authority, neither of which the Israelis want to empower in Gaza.\n\nHowever, humanitarian aid officials are concerned that the Fogbow venture, if it took off, could crowd out UN agencies and NGOs in the competition for scarce resources, such as trucks and drivers to distribute food around Gaza, and the time and attention of Israeli security screeners who are setting up a station in the Cypriot port of Larnaca to police the sea corridor.\n\nIf and when the maritime route opens and ships begin arriving at the US-made floating dock, it will be a spectacular, challenging but an extremely expensive and slow way of delivering aid.\n\n\"While private sector efforts to support aid agencies are appreciated, it's crucial to ensure that humanitarian principles are upheld throughout these endeavours,\" said Ziad Issa, the head of humanitarian policy at ActionAid UK.\n\nIssa added: \"A significant challenge remains with this plan: who will be responsible for delivering this aid on the ground? The time required for this new route to become operational is unlikely to address the urgent needs of those currently facing starvation and in dire need of food, water, and medical supplies.\"\n\nHumanitarian officials say there is a far easier method of delivering aid through land crossings in northern Gaza that could be opened at any time. Israel's siege of Gaza has so far prevented trucks from entering in anything like the numbers needed.\n\n\"There is an easier, faster, more efficient, cheaper and quicker way to reach people in the north,\" said Juliette Touma, Unrwa's communications director. \"It's very easy and very straightforward. All it takes is political will.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_dock",

Its construction comes as Israel faces widespread international criticism over the slow trickle of aid into the area, where the United Nations says at least a quarter of the population sits on the brink of starvation.\n\nHowever, the site has already been targeted by a militant mortar attack, according to the Israeli military. An official from the Hamas militant group that has run Gaza since 2007 has warned that any foreign military presence at the pier would be target for attack -- potentially complicating the aid efforts even further.\n\nAlso Read | Karachi Shocker: District Judge's Son Shot Dead by Friend for Eating Half of His Girlfriend's Burger in Pakistan, Accused Arrested.\n\nThe satellite pictures, taken by Planet Labs PBC, show that heavy construction at the site started over two weeks ago. The area sits just north of a road bisecting Gaza that the Israeli military built during the fighting.\n\nA UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes deliberations, said the port \"is directly at the end of the new road the IDF has put in place\". The official used an acronym for the Israeli military.\n\nHeavy trucks and machinery could be seen in an image taken a week ago by Planet Labs, with the cleared area appearing even larger in an image taken Wednesday. A dirt berm separates the area from nearby buildings. Other details correspond to an on-the-ground image of the aid pier seen by the AP.\n\nThe port will likely have three zones -- one controlled by the Israelis where aid from the pier is dropped off, another where the aid will be transferred, and a third where Palestinian drivers contracted by the UN will wait to pick up the aid before bringing it to distribution points, the UN official said.\n\nStill, the official said several sticking points remain around how the Israelis would handle the port's security. The military is reportedly seeking to install remote-controlled gun positions, which the UN opposes.\n\nIsraeli officials have told the AP that Israel will play a part in security of the pier and moving some of the aid from the pier ashore, though the extent of the planned Israeli involvement remains unclear. Multiple Israeli government agencies did not respond to requests to comment about the port.\n\nA top Cyprus government official, who spoke to the AP on the customary condition of anonymity, said the pier \"will be ready by (end of) next week and we will begin (aid shipments) again\". The official didn't specify when exactly shipments will begin.\n\nNavy officials confirmed to the AP what vessel tracking sites show: the USNS Benavidez, the American cargo ship that is carrying a lot of the larger equipment to build the pier, is now off the Gaza coast. Other army ships are either there or moving toward that area.\n\nConcerns still loom large -- the pier was attacked Wednesday, the UN official said, as four high-ranking UN officials were visiting the site. The military said the mortar fire from Gaza militants forced the officials to take shelter, but no one was killed or harmed.\n\nNo militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the assault.\n\nHowever, high-ranking Hamas political official Khalil al-Hayya has said the group would consider Israeli forces -- or forces from any other country -- stationed by the pier to guard it as \"an occupying force and aggression\".\n\nThe port could be a game-changer as ramping up aid into Gaza through land crossings has proven challenging, with long backups of trucks awaiting Israeli inspections. Past efforts to get land in by sea faltered after an attack on a World Central Kitchen convoy carrying aid from a port to a warehouse in central Gaza left seven aid workers dead.\n\nCountries have even tried airdropping aid from the sky -- a tactic which aid groups say is a last-ditch resort because it can't deliver aid in large quantities and also has led to deaths.

Operations could begin by the end of this month or early May.\n\nSupplies are to be delivered to the pier, anchored several kilometres off the coast, and relayed to a US-built causeway by US military boats where non-military lorries will collect and distribute aid. The stated aim is to provide two million meals a day.\n\nAfter reportedly tense discussions the World Food Programme, which is headed by US appointee Cindy McCain, agreed to partner with the US Agency for International Development to conduct the mission in co-ordination with the Israeli military.\n\nSeparately, Fogbow - a US private firm founded by former US military officers, diplomats, and intelligence agents - has proposed sending three large barges carrying aid trucks from Cyprus to Gaza where they would land near the pier in an area held by the Israeli army.\n\nUN and independent relief agencies have expressed concern about the apparent US takeover of the maritime humanitarian corridor originally meant to be used by non-profit organisations to ship aid from Cyprus to Gaza. An unnamed UN official said: \"The perception that would be created of humanitarians operating alongside the [Israeli army] in any way, shape, or form, would be ruinous for the reputation of humanitarians in Gaza. We would be seen to be collaborating. It would of course have knock-on consequences in terms of our safety and acceptance inside of Gaza.\"\n\nThe maritime corrido's original makeshift pier used by Spain's Open Arms vessels and the US-based World Central Kitchen in their two Gaza aid voyages was in northern Gaza, where the threat of famine is acute. However, the US pier is to be located off mid-Gaza where the Israeli army has built a road bisecting the narrow strip and set up checkpoints that have denied aid to 300,000 Gazans in the north.\n\nBy directing supplies to the south, Israel could assemble stocks for Gazans besieged in the town of Rafah, the main land crossing for aid lorries via Egypt. The Associated Press has reported that satellite photographs show a large tent compound is under construction near Khan Younis in the south. The Wall Street Journal has said the camp could house civilians evacuated in advance of Israel's offensive against Hamas's stronghold in Rafah.\n\nUS president Joe Biden has opposed Israel's assault until civilians are out of danger and food, water and medical services are provided, prompting Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to pause the offensive until civilians move.\n\n[ Israel-Hamas war: Palestinians forced to flee homes as Israel bombards northern Gaza ]\n\nSuggesting a US policy change, state department spokesman Matthew Miller said \"we don't think there's any effective way to evacuate 1.4 million\" without harming civilians and severely hampering the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\n\n\"We do want to see people able to leave Rafah to return to their homes - if they exist - and to their neighbourhoods and to begin rebuilding their homes,\" said Mr Miller. \"We want to see the Palestinian people in Gaza start to restart their lives and rebuild their lives and ultimately bring this conflict to a close.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday those vessels are \"standing by,\" ready to begin construction when ordered.\n\nAnother major hurdle was cleared in recent days when USAID announced the U.N.'s World Food Program (WFP) agreed to distribute the aid from the pier so long as certain conditions are met.\n\nCooperation from the U.N. aid group was key to the project moving ahead because Biden has mandated that no U.S. troops or private American contractors operate from the ground in Gaza.\n\nBut while the U.S. military can build the pier relatively quickly -- much as it did in 2010 off the coast of Haiti following an earthquake -- officials have spent weeks wrangling over how to operate a massive humanitarian hub in the middle of a war zone.\n\nAccording to one U.N. official, there have been lengthy discussions on the pier's precise location and where it might be most effective. It's also unclear how long the pier will need to be used.\n\nOn security, the U.N. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to describe internal deliberations, said the U.N. wants to rely on its own security to protect World Food Program staff, not the Israeli military. The primary concern, the person said, was to maintain neutrality in the conflict.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces currently manage checkpoints into Gaza and provide security for designated \"humanitarian corridors\" that enable U.N. trucks to travel north.\n\n\"Given the catastrophic hunger situation in Gaza, WFP is open to exploring any opportunity to safely reach people in desperate need,\" the WFP wrote in a statement. But any final agreement must set conditions \"that allow for safe, sustained, and scaled up assistance to reach people in need,\" the WFP added.\n\nMore than 200 humanitarian aid workers have been killed in Gaza and the West Bank since the beginning of the war on Oct. 7. Among those killed were seven aid workers with the World Central Kitchen in a strike on April 1 that Israeli forces said was a grave mistake.\n\nUSAID's Korde acknowledged the security concerns in a press briefing Tuesday.\n\n\"We're very cognizant ... that the U.N. needs to maintain its principles of neutrality and independence and access throughout Gaza,\" Korde said.\n\n\"We're trying to abide by those principles and make sure that everyone involved has the safety and security they need,\" she added.\n\nSince the Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers, and under pressure from Biden, Israel has dramatically increased the flow of humanitarian supplies into Gaza, allowing on average 200 aid trucks a day, according to the State Department.\n\nU.S. officials said this week that more needs to be done to improve the distribution of aid, provide potable water, and get lifesaving medicine to civilians. Administration officials also say they are pressing Israel to be clearer about which items included in humanitarian packages will be prohibited so that shipments don't get held up by Israeli security.\n\nDavid Satterfield, the State Department's special envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues, told reporters at the briefing that the U.S. has made clear to Israel that the military pier and maritime aid route needs to be done in addition to -- not in lieu of -- keeping ground checkpoints open to aid trucks.\n\n\"There is no question that the most efficient and effective ways to deliver assistance is by as many land corridors as possible,\" Satterfield said.\n\nWhen asked if the Israel Defense Forces would agree to the U.N. providing its own security, a spokesperson for the Israeli military declined to comment.\n\nBoth the Pentagon and USAID say that even with discussions underway, the project is still on track to become operational in early May.\n\n\"This is a complex operation that requires coordination between many partners, and our conversations are ongoing,\" a USAID spokesperson wrote in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news",

Tonight, I'm directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the coast of Gaza that can receive large shipments carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelters.\n\nNo U.S. boots will be on the ground.\n\nA temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.\n\nThe mission was idiocy from Day One. Because the US military doesn't have heavy lift ships, the flotilla of Army watercraft tasked with building the temporary pier had to self-deploy at a speed of about 12 knots and had a voyage plagued by mechanical failures. The mini-armada composed of five US Army watercraft -- USAV James A. Loux (LSV-6), USAV Montorrey (LCU-2030), USAV Matamoros (LCU-2026), USAV General Frank S. Besson Jr. (LSV-1) and USAV Wilson Wharf (LCU-2011) -- left Fort Eustis, VA, on March 12.\n\nThe remnants have only now arrived off Gaza.\n\nU.S. troops plan to start assembling a floating pier off the coast of northern Gaza as early as this weekend, American defense officials said, part of an effort by the Biden administration to open up new entryways for humanitarian aid ahead of a planned Israeli offensive in the city of Rafah.\n\n...\n\nThe Pentagon estimates that it will take U.S. troops 10 to 14 days to assemble the pier, but officials said it could take longer given the unusual challenges of building the pier as well as a floating causeway closer to the shore, without American military personnel ever setting foot in Gaza.\n\nThe mortar fire seems to have been directed at the construction of beach facilities to accommodate shipping containers and permit trucks access to the area.\n\nThis entire plan is utterly nuts. Hamas has no interest in allowing international aid organizations to bring aid to civilians independent of Hamas control. When aid to civilians does arrive, as the investigation into the World Community Kitchen debacle established, all aid vehicles forward of Israeli troop positions carry Hamas gunmen as \"security.\"\n\nRELATED: IDF Preliminary Investigation in Aid Worker Deaths Shows a Cascade of Errors and Confusion\n\nThe US is an ally of Israel, and there are no circumstances where US troops ashore in Gaza or afloat in the Mediterranean would not be considered targets by Hamas.\n\nI'm sure there will be more exciting developments as this project progresses.", "source": {"uri":

As a number of Republican Senators wrote to Biden on March 28:\n\nWe have strong reservations about your directing the United States military to establish a temporary pier on the Gaza Coast. While we acknowledge that this decision was taken with the consent of the Israeli government, we are concerned that the mission entails a significant risk to U.S. personnel. We are also concerned that this approach fails to address the main causes of the humanitarian crisis.\n\nFirst, this deployment ignores the most basic cause of Gaza's humanitarian crisis: the fact that Hamas ignited the current war on October 7 by murdering 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, and taking another 240 hostages, including 12 Americans. The conditions for ending the war and the ensuing humanitarian challenges are the same today as they were on October 7: Hamas' surrender and the return of the approximately 140 remaining hostages, including six Americans.\n\nSecond, based on what has been shared with the Senate Armed Services Committee thus far, this decision appears to ignore force protection issues entirely against an enemy that tries to kill Americans every day. We are gravely concerned that the Department of Defense has given too little consideration to the likelihood that Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and other U.S.-designated terrorist organizations operating in Gaza would attempt to attack the U.S. personnel that will be deployed to this mission. Since October 7, Iran-backed proxies, of which Hamas and PIJ are two, have attacked U.S. forces in Jordan, Syria, Iraq, and off the coast of Yemen. Hamas is blatantly indifferent to the humanitarian crisis that its October 7 massacre has wrought, and it is unlikely to be deterred by the humanitarian nature of the U.S. mission to establish a pier off the coast of Gaza.\n\nThere is no apparent plan to secure distribution, to keep aid in civilians' hands and out of Hamas'. The latter would provide Hamas sustenance to continue fighting rather than force it to return the hostages and end the war.\n\nIranian backed terrorist organization Hamas, which started the war against Israel on October 7, continues to steal aid trucks sent into the area by Israel, Jordan and other countries. Hamas is still holding 133 hostages, including five Americans.\n\nAt a March 8 Pentagon briefing, officials gave little reassurance the pier could be protected from terrorists operating in the Gaza Strip.\n\nQ: Does the DoD anticipate that Hamas will try to fire on them, on the operation (inaudible)?\n\nGEN. RYDER: Look, I mean, that's certainly a risk, again, but if Hamas truly does care about the Palestinian people, then again, one would hope that this international mission to deliver aid to people who need it would be able to happen unhindered.\n\nFormer national security officials and experts warn the pier could be a floating death trap for U.S. troops and a scenario that could lead to another Abbey Gate situation.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_pavlich@townhall.com", "name": "Katie Pavlich", "type": "author",

Gen. Pat Ryder said on April 23 at a press conference.\n\nHe was answering questions from the press and was asked about the US plans, which go back several months, to boost humanitarian aid via this novel approach of building a temporary pier or floating dock off Gaza.\n\n\"So as I understand it, as of right now, there has been no physical construction of the temporary pier or the causeway. As we've discussed, you know, there is a -- for lack of a better term, sort of a checklist that one is going to follow in order to implement this capability,\" Ryder said. \"As Central Command and U.S. Army Central goes through that checklist, we are positioned to begin construction very soon, in the very near future, but you want to do those steps in order so that by the time you are erecting this causeway and temporary pier, that all of the pieces are in place and that you can begin operating.\"\n\nThis illustrates the complexity involved in the operation. The US has sent an armada of five ships, one of which was left off the coast of Africa, to help build the pier. According to vessel tracking data, the USAV Monterrey is still in port at Crete in Souda Bay at a naval facility.\n\nMoving in from Cyprus\n\nThe USAV James Loux has moved positions in the same bay but may be waiting to sail toward Cyprus and Gaza. USAV General Frank S. Besson and the USAV Matamoros appear to have left Souda Bay and are heading toward Cyprus.\n\nFrank Besson is in the lead, and it looks like it could be off the coast of Gaza or Israel in several days. The Matamoros passed the Crete part of Heraklion recently and will soon begin the multi-day trip towards Cyprus or Israel. The USAV Wilson's Wharf was apparently left behind off the coast of Africa for reasons that remain unclear.\n\nAs such, the armada, now stretched out over a hundred miles of ocean, continues to make its way to Gaza. They have now been at sea for a month and a half after leaving port in Fort Eustis around March 12.\n\nRyder indicated at the Pentagon on April 23 that the US estimates that keeping this plan on track will mean starting work in early May on the pier.\n\n\"As I understand it, all the necessary vessels are within the Mediterranean region and standing by, as I mentioned, to begin construction when given the order to do that. Again, you know, there is a process and procedure that will have to be followed,\" he said. He also discussed the complex other aspects of the project, such as working to make sure the area is secure and also working with local partners which \"include NGOs, working with USAID, there's a very specific process and timeline that needs to be implemented. And so again, as I understand it, we're on track at this point to implement that,\" he said.\n\nThere is still some lack of clarity on how this will all work. It should mean a maritime corridor from Cyprus can be maintained. Ruder said the pier would be \"several miles off-shore\" and that it could receive military and civilian vessels, and then items could be loaded onto the floating dock and then moved to the shore.\n\nVessels will then take the aid to a temporary causeway on shore, and it will be put into trucks driven by local NGOs. This leaves questions about which NGOs. An airstrike on a World Central Kitchen convoy caused that group, which was working from Cyprus with UAE backing and using a Spanish ship, to pause its work in early April.\n\nIt was clear from the questions at the Pentagon that much remains to be worked out or that not everyone is privy to the plans afoot for this complex operation. The US military, and the US army in particular, likely wants to see if this capability to build a floating pier in a real-life crisis will work as planned.\n\nIn the past, these units have trained for this, but this is a unique scenario. Moving these transport ships, which sit low in the water and move along at a slow pace of around 10 knots, all the way across the Atlantic, is one of those interesting missions that pop up, enabling a military to try something it has practiced for over the years.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

bringing in over 500 trucks of aid per day from around four land crossings, according to Israeli officials, the island will not replace but complement the land aid efforts.\n\nThe US's artificial island is expected to be completed and operating by early May, according to IDF sources.\n\nThe artificial island, or Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS) pier, has been in the works since it was announced by US President Joe Biden in his State of the Union address on March 7.\n\nAt the time, the announcement caught many Israeli officials by surprise and it was the start of a series of moves of Washington injecting itself more forcefully into the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nLate Sunday, the IDF announced that it will operate to provide security and logistics support for the JLOTS initiative, which includes the establishment of a temporary floating pier to deliver humanitarian aid from the sea into Gaza.\n\nIt was expected that the new aid would speed up toppling Hamas\n\nBut shortly after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted he had offered the possibility back in October 2023 (though at the time he was trying to use it to stave off having to open land aid crossings), and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on March 10 that the new US maritime Gaza humanitarian aid program would speed up toppling Hamas.\n\nThe challenge of getting the JLOTS going connects to why it may also get up and running relatively quickly.\n\nA series of large US naval vessels have been making their way slowly across the Atlantic, but when they arrive, in the upcoming days, they have essentially all of the equipment and materials needed to establish the temporary island off Gaza.\n\nThe island is expected to be an addition to land aid efforts\n\nNow that Gaza is bringing in over 500 trucks of aid per day from around four land crossings according to Israeli officials, the island will not replace, but complement the land aid efforts.\n\nIt will also help connect Gaza to the world in ways that it has been cut off since Israel imposed a blockade on Hamas when the group routed Fatah from the Strip in 2007.\n\nThe pier is expected to be around 550 meters long and wide enough to carry two lanes of trucks.\n\nGiven the Gazan coast's shallow waters, the US Navy will facilitate the operation by running short ferry rounds bringing the trucks from roll-on/roll-off ships to the pier, with around 1,000 US military personnel expected to be involved.\n\nIDF sources said there are special efforts to try to protect the pier and the US soldiers from Hamas.\n\nCyprus will also play a critical role in ferrying aid between the pier and Israel.\n\nThe artificial island will be going up just as a new flotilla may arrive from Turkey seeking to bring aid directly to Gazans without Israeli inspections.\n\nPrior flotilla attempts have led to arrests and even altercations, with around 10 flotilla passengers dying in fights with IDF soldiers in 2010 (several soldiers were wounded,

It includes a floating pier -- an 1,800-foot-long causeway that will be attached to the shore and a group of logistic support vessels and barges that will transport the aid from the pier to the causeway, according to the Pentagon.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military logistics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/04/25/thumbs_b_c_bf2cb6a756d438cf6db1f476ab12c947.jpg?v=221624", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511461", "eventUri": "eng-9511461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-08", "textStart": 787, "textEnd": 794}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Palestinian terrorists on Wednesday attacked the U.S. pier being constructed off the coast of Gaza, the Israeli TV channel i24NEWS reported.\n\nGaza \"terrorists launched mortars at the maritime construction site, damaging several pieces of engineering equipment,\" the TV channel revealed. \" In addition, one person was slightly injured while running to a protected area.\"\n\nThe U.S. military is involved in the construction of the floating dock. It is unclear if American servicemen or civilian contractors were present at the site during the terrorist attack.\n\nLast month, President Joe Biden announced the decision to construct a floating pier for large-scale aid delivery to Gaza and supply aid through trucks and airdrops. \"I'm directing the US military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters,\" President Biden declared on March 7.\n\nThe i24NEWS reported:\n\nGazan terrorists fired mortar shells on Wednesday towards the construction work on the humanitarian pier being built off the coast of Gaza.\n\ni24NEWS has learned that several pieces of American engineering equipment were damaged in the attack. In addition, one person was slightly injured while running to a protected area.\n\nThe United States has been building the floating pier in order to channel additional humanitarian aid that would arrive via sea route. U.S. President Joe Biden announced the plan during his State of the Union address in early March, clarifying that there would be \"no U.S. boots on the ground.\"\n\nThe IDF will likely be in charge of ensuring the security of the costly pier, and the distribution of aid that comes through it, although there has not been any official announcement yet about where the aid will be sourced from.\n\nThis is not the first time Palestinian terrorists have targeted humanitarian efforts to help the Gazans. In the past, Hamas terrorists have used delivery of food supplies to ambush Israeli troops. Terrorists have repeatedly attacked IDF soldiers, assisting civilians to evacuate the combat zones.\n\nPelosi urges Netanyahu to step down, calls him an \"obstacle to two-state solution\"\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi is now calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign as the IDF gears up to flush out Hamas from its last-standing stronghold of Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nThe former House Speaker described the Israeli Prime Minister as an 'obstacle to the two-state solution.' The Biden administration has been working behind the scenes to reward Palestinians with statehood in the aftermath of the October 7 massacre, news reports indicate.\n\nThe Biden White House and leading Democrats see Netanyahu as a significant opponent of their policy to appease the Palestinians. Last month, Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called for Netanyahu's ouster and fresh elections in Israel. Hillary also urged Netanyahu to step down, calling him 'not a trustworthy leader.'\n\nThe British newspaper Telegraph, on Wednesday, reported Pelosi's remarks:\n\nNancy Pelosi has called for Benjamin Netanyahu to resign as prime minister of Israel, accusing him of being unable to bring peace to the Gaza conflict.\n\nThe former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, 84, said that Mr Netanyahu's \"policy and practice\" had been \"terrible\" and that he should stand aside.\n\nSpeaking to RTE, an Irish broadcaster, on a visit to the country, Ms Pelosi said the number of people who had died in Gaza since Hamas's attack on October 7 was \"too many\".\n\nIDF blows up 12-mile Hamas tunnel, destroys terror infrastructure\n\nAmid reports of Israeli military preparations for an assault on Hamas's last-standing stronghold of Rafah, the IDF is turning up the heat on Palestinian terrorists operating in the rest of the enclave. After a large-scale raid in northern Gaza earlier this week, the Israeli military destroyed a 12-mile-long terror tunnel connecting Hamas fighting forces between north and south.\n\n\"The soldiers, in cooperation with the Yahalom Unit and combat engineers, located and destroyed over 20 kilometers of terror tunnels in the corridor area, part of which connected the Gaza Strip from the north to the south underground,\" the Jerusalem Post reported Thursday.\n\nJoint operations by the Israeli military and the air force destroyed Hamas's terrorist infrastructure. \"The IDF continues to operate in the central Gaza corridor and over the past day, eliminated terrorists and destroyed terror infrastructure,\" the IDF said in a press release Thursday. \"Throughout the past day, IAF fighter jets and aircraft struck over 50 targets. Furthermore, an IAF aircraft struck an operational tunnel shaft and additional terror infrastructure in the central Gaza Strip.\"", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news",

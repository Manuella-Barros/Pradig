Rating agency Fitch cut its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating to negative last month, citing risks to public finances as growth slows and government debt rises.\n\nThe Politburo of the Communist Party, the party's top decision-making body, said last month it would step up support for the economy with prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policies, including through interest rates and bank reserve requirement ratios.\n\nChina has set an economic growth target for 2024 of around 5%, which many analysts say will be a challenge to achieve without much more stimulus.\n\nChinese exporters had a tough time for most of last year as soaring interest rates weighed on overseas demand. With the Federal Reserve and other developed nations showing no urgency to cut borrowing costs, manufacturers may face further strains as they battle for market share.\n\nAnalysts say Chinese exporters are continuing to slash prices to maintain sales abroad amid the weak domestic demand conditions.\n\n\"Overcapacity in many industries will continue to depress export prices in the coming months,\" said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.\n\n\"As more Chinese companies make investments overseas to get around potential sanctions from the U.S., we expect more exports of industrial inputs like chemicals, fabric, auto parts and electric machineries,\" she added.\n\nChina's trade surplus grew to $72.35 billion, compared with a forecast of $77.50 billion in the poll and $58.55 billion in March. -

China has set an economic growth target for 2024 of around 5%, which many analysts say will be a challenge to achieve without much more stimulus.\n\nChinese exporters had a tough time for most of last year as soaring interest rates weighed on overseas demand. With the Federal Reserve and other developed nations showing no urgency to cut borrowing costs, manufacturers may face further strains as they battle for market share. Analysts say Chinese exporters are continuing to slash prices to maintain sales abroad amid the weak domestic demand conditions.\n\n\"Overcapacity in many industries will continue to depress export prices in the coming months,\" said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China. \"As more Chinese companies make investments overseas to get around potential sanctions from the U.S., we expect more exports of industrial inputs like chemicals, fabric, auto parts and electric machineries,\" she added.\n\nChina's trade surplus grew to $72.35 billion, compared with a forecast of $77.50 billion in the poll and $58.55 billion in March.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Ratings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fitch Ratings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Seng_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hang Seng Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_19_16_04_3385426.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551894", "eventUri": "eng-9551894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

This positive shift indicates a promising enhancement in both local and international demand, providing a vital lift to the nation's fragile economic recovery.\n\nThe upswing in data suggests that the numerous policy support measures introduced in recent times are beginning to yield results, thereby stabilising investor and consumer confidence, which had previously been wavering. Last month, China's exports rose by 1.5% year-on-year, matching the prediction made by economists in a Reuters poll. This growth follows a fall of 7.5% in March, the first contraction since November.\n\nMeanwhile, April's imports saw an increase of 8.4%, surpassing the anticipated rise of 4.8% and reversing the decline of 1.9% witnessed in March, said Zhang Zhiwei, the chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\n\"Exports have been the bright spot in China's economy so far this year. The weak domestic demand led to deflationary pressure, which boosts China's export competitiveness.\"\n\nDespite the economy growing faster than projected in the first quarter, data on exports, consumer inflation, producer prices, and bank lending for March suggest that the momentum may be flagging. A prolonged property crisis also continues unabated, prompting calls for additional policy stimulus.\n\nDuring the first quarter, both imports and exports experienced a year-on-year rise of 1.5%. Several economic indicators exceeded expectations during the January-February period, and a survey of factory owners in March indicated that the world's second-largest economy had managed to successfully navigate initial hurdles. This has allowed officials additional time to bolster fragile investor confidence and stimulate growth.\n\nNonetheless, Beijing faces significant challenges. Last month, rating agency Fitch downgraded its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating to negative, citing risks to public finances as growth slows and government debt increases.\n\nChina economy\n\nIn response, the Communist Party's Politburo, the party's primary decision-making body, announced last month that it would enhance economic support through prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policies. These would include adjustments to interest rates and bank reserve requirement ratios.\n\nChina has set an economic growth target for 2024 of around 5%, a goal that many analysts believe will be challenging to achieve without substantial additional stimulus. Chinese exporters, who struggled for most of last year due to skyrocketing interest rates impacting overseas demand, may face further challenges as they compete for market share.\n\nAnalysts suggest that Chinese exporters are continuing to reduce prices to sustain sales abroad amidst weak domestic demand conditions, stated Dan Wang, the chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China.\n\n\"Overcapacity in many industries will continue to depress export prices in the coming months.\n\nShe added, \"As more Chinese companies make investments overseas to get around potential sanctions from the US. We expect more exports of industrial inputs like chemicals, fabric, auto parts, and electric machinery.\"\n\nIn comparison, to the predicted US$77.50 billion in the poll and US$58.55 billion in March, China's trade surplus expanded to US$72.35 billion, reported Bangkok Post.", "source": {"uri": "thethaiger.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Thaiger"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_morgan@thethaiger.com", "name": "Alex Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_indicator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic indicator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Ratings", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fitch Ratings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Seng_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hang Seng Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://thethaiger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551894", "eventUri": "eng-9551894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Shipments from China grew 1.5% year-on-year last month, in line with the increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. They fell 7.5% in March, which marked the first contraction since November.\n\nImports for April increased 8.4%, beating an expected 4.8% rise. China's economy grew faster than expected in the first quarter, although data on exports, consumer inflation, producer prices and bank lending for March showed that momentum could be faltering again. A protracted property crisis is also showing few signs of abating, spurring calls for more policy stimulus.\n\nIn the first quarter, both imports and exports rose 1.5% year-on-year. A string of forecast-beating economic data over the January-February period and a factory owners survey for March suggested the world's No.2 economy had managed to successfully navigate some early challenges, buying officials more time to lift fragile investor confidence and revitalise growth.\n\nHowever, Beijing has its work cut out. Rating agency Fitch cut its outlook on China's sovereign credit rating to negative last month, citing risks to public finances as growth slows and government debt rises. The Politburo of the Communist Party, the party's top decision-making body, said last month it would step up support for the economy with prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policies, including through interest rates and bank reserve requirement ratios.\n\nChina has set an economic growth target for 2024 of around 5%, which many analysts say will be a challenge to achieve without much more stimulus. Chinese exporters had a tough time for most of last year as soaring interest rates weighed on overseas demand. With the Federal Reserve and other developed nations showing no urgency to cut borrowing costs, manufacturers may face further strains as they battle for market share.\n\nAnalysts say Chinese exporters are continuing to slash prices to maintain sales abroad amid stubbornly weak domestic demand. That was highlighted by export volumes edging up to record highs in March. China's trade surplus grew to $72.35 billion, compared with a forecast of $77.50 billion in the poll and $58.55 billion in March.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch_Ratings", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fitch Ratings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve requirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_19_18_04_5779125.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551894", "eventUri": "eng-9551894", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

With the country's laser-like focus on the economy through a slew of stimulus measures, China's economic recovery will continue to consolidate and is on track to meet annual growth targets, they noted.\n\nIn April, in US dollar terms, total imports and exports surged 4.4 percent year-on-year, reversing a 5.1 percent drop in March, according to the General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Thursday. Notably, exports expanded by 1.5 percent year-on-year in April, compared to a 7.5 percent contraction in the previous month, while imports jumped by 8.4 percent year-on-year, reversing a 1.9 percent decline in March, the GAC data showed.\n\n\"First-quarter trade data were dragged down by the drop in March due to a high base in March 2023. And April's data more accurately reflected the development trade in China's import and export sectors,\" Zhou Mi, a senior research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the media on Thursday.\n\nZhou said that the trade data demonstrated the steady recovery trend of the Chinese economy supported by a strong rebound in the trade sector in the first four months of 2024.\n\nDuring that period, in Chinese yuan-denominated terms, China's total imports and exports expanded by 5.7 percent year-on-year, accelerating from a 5 percent growth in the first quarter of the year, according to the GAC.\n\nIn terms of top trading partners, China's imports and exports with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, better known as ASEAN, its largest trading partner, jumped by 8.5 percent year-on-year from January to April. Imports and exports with the EU, the second-largest trading partner, dropped by 1.8 percent year-on-year, while that with the US, the third-largest trading partner, grew by 1.1 percent year-on-year.\n\nMoreover, among the highlights of Thursday's data are the robust growth in exports by private enterprises and exports of mechanical and electrical products - both major growth drivers. Private firms' total exports expanded by 9 percent year-on-year in the first four months in yuan terms, accounting for 64.7 percent of China's total export value. Exports of mechanical and electrical products grew by 6.9 percent, accounting for 59.2 percent of China's total export value, according to the GAC.\n\nThe strong figures for the January-April period also reflected China's strong competitiveness and prominent role in the global industrial and supply chain, Zhou noted. \"If there are no major 'black swan' events in the future, and there are no policies and actions that significantly interfere with trade activities, trade will still maintain a sustained recovery,\" he said.\n\nWhile the growth in exports highlighted China's unshakable role in global trade, the expansion in imports accentuated the strong recovery in China's domestic demand, which is key to the overall economic recovery, according to experts.\n\n\"In the previous two years, the growth rate of imports was relatively low, and the total import and export volume was mainly supported by exports, reflecting insufficient domestic demand, Hu Qimu, a deputy secretary-general of the digital-real economies integration Forum 50, told the Global Times on Thursday.\n\n\"But vis-\u00e0-vis this year's data, the growth rate of imports is higher than that of exports, indicating that domestic demand is recovering and the overall internal circulation is becoming smoother,\" Hu noted.\n\nHu said that China has moved swiftly to tackle systemic risks, consumption has been recovering steadily and operations of various industries have been improving significantly.\n\nThe impressive trade data on Thursday come on the heels of a slew of indicators that showed a strong recovery momentum in the Chinese economy. In the first quarter of 2024, China's GDP expanded by 5.3 percent year-on-year, beating market expectations. Retail sales, a main gauge of consumption and the biggest economic growth driver, increased by 4.7 percent year-on-year.\n\nSuch strong momentum in China's economic recovery is widely expected to further gather traction, as Chinese policymakers continue to step up policy support to boost the economy, experts said.\n\nThe latest signal of strong policy support came from a meeting, held on April 30, of the Political Bureau of the 20th Communist Party of China Central Committee. Noting that the economy has secured a good start this year, the meeting called for various measures to further consolidate the recovery momentum, including front-loading efforts to effectively put the established macro policies in place and issuing ultra-long special treasury bonds at an early stage, according to the Xinhua News Agency.\n\nIn terms of trade, the meeting called for efforts to actively expand trade in intermediate goods, service trade, digital trade, and cross-border e-commerce exports, and support private enterprises in expanding overseas markets.\n\nApart from policy support, the strong recovery in domestic consumption will help stabilize trade throughout the year, according to Hu. \"The full-year trade will maintain a generally positive growth rate that is higher than that of last year,\" he said.\n\nBeyond trade, China's two other main economic drivers - consumption and investment - are also expected to maintain a strong recovery momentum, thanks to intensifying policy support, which will ensure that the full-year economic development goals will be met, experts noted.\n\nIn spite of challenges both at home and abroad, China has set a GDP growth target of around 5 percent this year. With the growing positive signs, many experts are increasingly confident that China will be able to meet its 2024 GDP growth target, and the country will remain the main driver for global growth.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Mi_(badminton)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhou Mi (badminton)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhou dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Administration_of_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Administration of Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stimulus (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Global Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/China-trade.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551894", "eventUri": "eng-9551894", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 4810, "textEnd": 4818}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

However, last month, April 2024, China's trade performance improved, with imports increasing rapidly. This should be good news for President Joko Widodo (Jokowi).\n\nChina's export-import balance performance even exceeded expectations that month, citing a South China Morning Post report. Chinese exports increased by 1.5% on an annual basis to reach $292.5 billion, although in March 2024 the contraction was 7.5%.\n\nAt the same time, the performance of imports was stronger, with growth recorded reaching 8.4% on an annual or year-on-year (year-on-year) basis. In March 2024, China's import rate contracted, as did export performance, with a decline of minus 1.9%.\n\nWith this note, China's trade balance will experience a surplus in April 2024 which will amount to 72.4 billion US dollars. This surplus figure increased from that of March 2024, which was only $58.6 billion.\n\n\"The country's economy is supported by trade due to the rise of foreign economies, particularly the United States,\" said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Capital.\n\nRising global demand provides impetus for trade-led economic growth. Beijing has made its exports a means of protecting itself against domestic difficulties, notably the current real estate crisis and weak household spending.\n\n\"This means that exports will be an important driver of economic growth in 2024,\" said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Hong Kong.\n\nChinese exports fell last year as foreign demand collapsed and suffered their first growth slowdown in seven years. However, this year, many expect global trade performance to soar.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for example, has estimated that growth in global trade in goods and services could reach 2.3% this year and 3.3% in 2025, up from growth of 1%. Last year.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund or IMF also predicted last month that global trade volume growth would reach 3% in 2024 and 3.3% in 2025.\n\n\"Export [China] will increase again as global demand recovers and an increasing number of Chinese products become competitive in international markets,\" said Larry Hu.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joko Widodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Morning_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South China Morning Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macquarie Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://awsimages.detik.net.id/visual/2023/07/27/jokowi-xi-jinping_169.jpeg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551894", "eventUri": "eng-9551894", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

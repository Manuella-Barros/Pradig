Entrepreneurs and boards leading a business are expected to create sound strategies. Yet, too often, what is presented as a strategy in business needs more substance that addresses practical issues. Reviving the best practices of strategic thinking will take determinate leadership. The Prevalence Of Bad Strategies In today's business landscape, effective strategies are more of a rarity than the norm. A quick glance at what is commonly accepted as strategy reveals this reality. Many business leaders mistakenly equate a vision, mission and broad goals with strategy. While these elements are important for public-facing communication, true strategy involves much more than simply outlining desired outcomes. One of the leading researchers in the field, Richard Rumelt, says that bad strategy spreads as a social contagion due to this tendency to present ambition for performance as a strategy. As it lacks any reference to obstacles and how they can be overcome, strictly speaking, there is no strategy here. However, having no strategy is better than mistaking this wishful thinking for strategy. How A Bad Strategy Is Worse Than No Strategy Using a wish list as a substitute for a strategy masks the absence of a genuine plan. In this scenario, ineffective strategy consumes valuable time and mental energy crafting superficial content that fails to guide action while hindering the development of a meaningful plan.

When individuals associate strategy solely with lofty mission statements or grand initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions, they overlook the strategic steps necessary for progress. These steps are often straightforward and logical, lacking immediate excitement. Reintroducing this seemingly mundane yet practical view of strategy can align all stakeholders and boost company morale. 4 Data-Driven Business Strategy Essentials Reviving a sound strategy involves both complexity and simplicity. It's complex due to the inertia that impedes current strategic thought processes. However, it's also simple because there are only a few key essentials to prioritize. Aligning these elements involves underpinning decisions with relevant data. 1. Concentrating On Short-Term Specifics If a strategy is too general, it can fail to guide action. For example, growing market share by becoming the most customer-centric company in the industry is not a complete strategy. There are hundreds of ways to be customer-centric. You need internal customer satisfaction data leveraged against competitive intelligence to specify the most customer-centric means in your particular circumstances. Furthermore, while there are many forecasting methods, predictions need to be revised often. Thus, it is better to focus on short-term specifics. Think of it like using headlights at night down an unfamiliar road. By using these headlights to focus on your turns and avoid obstacles, you can more effectively and safely reach your intended destination. 2. Addressing Challenges Strategy starts where smooth sailing ends. You do not need a strategy if there are no obstacles to achieving your goals. You simply need to complete the apparent course of action. For example, if you want to scale by entering new markets and you have limitless funds, there is no need for strategic thinking. However, if you need new investments, you must address investor worries and distrust in the current economic conditions. Data on infrastructure critical to sustainable supply chains in the area, georeferenced labor market data and similar information are necessary to sway investors in this case. When the main challenges are unclear, gathering competitive intelligence is a good place to start. Additionally, historical data might uncover trends to help deduce what challenges are likely when aiming for particular goals in specific circumstances. 3. Making Hard Choices One of the most common barriers to a good strategy is the lack of will to choose a course of action. Choices can be difficult. They might involve shutting down pet projects or disappointing someone\u2019s expectations and ambitions. It is impossible to know whether your chosen course was the best one possible. However, a decent and coherent strategy is enough to prevent pulling resources in different directions. A significant part of leadership is making the hard choices to set the course without being sure it is correct, while others are certain you are wrong. Supporting the chosen strategy with data can help deal with pressures, internal and external. The more data-based your strategic decisions are, the better your chance of convincing stakeholders and achieving at least some measure of success. 4. Verifying It Is Actionable Some people blame execution when a strategy fails. This separation of strategy and execution has long been recognized as detrimental to business management. It enables managers to avoid responsibility by claiming the plan was sound, but employees were not engaged, time ran out or the software tools were inadequate. However, effective planning should include ways to improve engagement, accurately estimate the necessary time and test the tools before incorporating them into the strategy. Don\u2019t create a strategy for a more prosperous or technologically advanced company. Develop a strategy tailored to your own company, ensuring it can be executed with the resources you have or can reasonably acquire. In Summary Strategy is hard work. Success is not guaranteed, but you can improve your chances by ensuring the best use of your available data. It can help correctly allocate resources, get everyone within the company as well as investors on board and measure your progress. This can ultimately build a true, effective strategy where others only believe they've built one.

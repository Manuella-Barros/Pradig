MacIntrye leads Ryan Fox, Mackenzie Huges and Ben Griffin by four shots heading into the final round at Hamilton Golf and Country Club on Sunday, with the Scotsman taking charge thanks a sensational run of five-under-par over his final five holes on Saturday. The lefty has hit a decent run of form in recent weeks, contending at the Myrtle Beach Classic before finishing tied for eighth at the PGA Championship last month. But a win on Sunday would be his first on the PGA Tour, and it would be extra special for the Oban native with his father, Dougie, carrying his bag.

He made a last-minute call to his father just days before the tournament, but it is clear Dougie has done a fine job this week at keeping his son's mental game sharp as he chases his first victory on tour. The world number 76 was one-over par for his round as he made the turn, and he revealed a blunt message from his father made all the difference as he finished the day with a four-under-par round of 66 to lead the way at 14-under. \"He was having a wee go at me when I was walking from the 10th tee down to the fairway,\" MacIntyre said. \"Look, he was a sporty guy, he knows how to win, he knows how to lose. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. \"He's been through it all and he could see my head going a little bit and he's like 'What have you been working on for the last eight, 10 weeks?' When I realised what the problem was, I kind of flicked into mode and tried to find the positive in everything.\" MacIntyre earned his PGA Tour card after finishing 13th in the DP World Tour's Race To Dubai rankings last year. He is a two-time winner on the DP World Tour, and he admits a win in Canada would be made all the more special with his father beside him. \"It's just different, it hits differently because he properly means it,\" MacIntyre said of his father's influence this week. \"And I know the caddies mean it for another reason. I mean they are obviously wanting us to do well, but my dad wants me to do well because we're blood and there's no other [reason]. \"There's nothing other than pride and guts in what we're trying to do. He's been through thick and thin for me. He taught me how to play the game of golf until I really started working with a coach at probably about 14, 15. To be honest, it was just me, him and my family going round four holes at Glencruitten Golf Club out of the back of the house for many years.\" World number two Rory McIlroy, a two-time winner in Canada, remains in with an outside chance of victory in Sunday after carding a round of five-under on Saturday to move within seven shots of MacIntyre. England's Tommy Fleetwood and Aaron Rai are also in the hunt at nine and eight-under respectively, but MacIntyre starts as a heavy favourite.", "summary": "Robert MacIntyre is just 18 holes from PGA Tour glory with the Ryder Cup star carrying a four-shot lead into the final round of Sunday's Canadian Open, with Tommy Fleetwood and Rory McIlroy chasing", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/robert-macintyre-dad-canadian-open-32942581", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32942613.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2155652254.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:58", "author": "Sam Frost,Sam-frost", "authors": ["Sam Frost", "Sam-frost"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.12}

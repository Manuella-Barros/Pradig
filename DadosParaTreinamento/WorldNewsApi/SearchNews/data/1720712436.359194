{"id": 232008670, "title": "When Prince William and King Charles Gave Cold One-Word Reply to Prince Harry During a Secret Meeting", "text": "Prince Harry shed light on a tense encounter with his father, King Charles, and his brother, Prince William, during a \u2018secret meeting\u2019 aimed at resolving their ongoing rift. The meeting took place in 2021 when Harry returned to London for the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip. This was Harry\u2019s first trip back to the UK since he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as senior royals. In his memoir, Spare, Harry wrote about his anxiety while waiting for his brother and father. He shared, \"At last, I saw them. Shoulder to shoulder, striding towards me, they looked grim, almost menacing...they looked tightly aligned. My stomach dropped. Normally they'd be squabbling about one thing or another, but now they appeared to be in lockstep\u2014 in league. The thought occurred\u2014 Hang on, are we meeting for a walk...or a duel?\u201d As per Mirror, Harry added, \"I rose from the wooden bench, made a tentative step towards them, and gave a weak smile. They didn\u2019t smile back. Now my heart started thrashing in my chest. Deep breaths, I told myself. Apart from fear, I was feeling a kind of hyper-awareness, and a hugely intense vulnerability, which I\u2019d experienced at other key moments of my life. Walking behind my mother's coffin. Going into battle for the first time. Giving a speech in the middle of a panic attack. There was that same sense of embarking on a quest, and not knowing if I was up to it, while also fully knowing that there was no turning back. That fate was in the saddle. OK, Mummy, I thought, picking up the pace, here goes. Wish me luck. We met in the middle of the path.\" He revealed that he greeted them affectionately with, 'Willy' and 'Pa', to which they responded with a single 'painfully tepid' word- 'Harold'. The Duke is nicknamed Harold by his family, even though his full name is Henry. Reflecting further on the cold welcome, he recounted having \"vowed not to let the encounter devolve into another argument.\" He explained, \"But I quickly discovered that it wasn\u2019t up to me...Pa and Willy had their parts to play, and they'd come ready for a fight. Every time I ventured a new explanation...started a new line of thought, one or both of them would cut me off.\" Following the release of Spare, Harry revealed that he had removed several important details about his family. As per Marie Claire, he admitted, \u201cIt could have been two books, put it that way. And the hard bit was taking things out. There are some things...that have happened, especially between me and my brother, and to some extent between me and my father, that I just don't want the world to know. Because I don't think they would ever forgive me.\"", "summary": "<img alt=\"When Prince William and King Charles Gave Cold One-Word Reply to Prince Harry During a Secret Meeting\" src=\"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/696934/uploads/bfdaf940-1f48-11ef-a5de-2f941ff8494e_800_420.jpeg\" />\n                In his memoir &#39;Spare&#39;, Harry wrote about his anxiety when waiting to meet his brother and father in 2021, and the subsequent cold welcome he received.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/when-prince-william-and-king-charles-gave-cold-one-word-reply-to-prince-harry-during-a-secret-meeting", "image": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/696934/uploads/bfdaf940-1f48-11ef-a5de-2f941ff8494e_1200_630.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:30:00", "author": "INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta", "authors": ["INQUISITR", "Ishita Sen Gupta"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.235}

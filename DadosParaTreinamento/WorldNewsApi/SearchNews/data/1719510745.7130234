The Morrocan international arrived at Old Trafford last summer on loan from Fiorentina with United having an option to complete a permanent deal, thought to be \u00a317 million, plus a further \u00a34.2m in add-ons. Amrabat has had a mixed season but excelled in midfield against Manchester City on Saturday. The 27-year-old played the full 90 minutes to help United end City's 35-match unbeaten run and seal a disappointing campaign with a trophy. A decision must now be made over whether the club sign Amrabat permanently.

No. We are going to talk,\" he told Dutch media outlet Ziggo Sport. \"Staying is certainly an option. Look, I think it has been a very difficult season. For Manchester United it needs to be much better, and also for me personally.\" On filling in at left-back earlier this season, he continued: \"That wasn\u2019t easy. I have always remained calm and trained very hard. Ultimately, that patience has been rewarded. \"A very big compliment to the coach, he prepared us so well. This is exactly the plan we wanted and what he said came true. We just had to keep it compact, keep the spaces very small, work really hard and then hope to do something during transitions. \"I think we scored two perfect goals and gave away very little. In the end, all in all, it was a perfect plan and we executed it to perfection.\"", "summary": "Latest Manchester United news as Sofyan Amrabat speaks after helping Erik ten Hag's side beat Manchester City in Saturday's FA Cup final", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sofyan-amrabat-drops-manchester-united-29241861", "image": "https://i2-prod.coventrytelegraph.net/incoming/article29241998.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154053576.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:26:39", "author": "Isaac Seelochan", "authors": ["Isaac Seelochan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.23}

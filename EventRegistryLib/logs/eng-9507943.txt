World\" and emphasized the need for collective commitment to change the narrative and achieve progress and equity in combating malaria.\n\nHe also disclosed that malaria disproportionately affects vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, infants, children under five, refugees, migrants, and internally displaced people, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequity.\n\nALSO READ: Oyo govt absorbs 129 'floating staff' into mainstream civil service\n\nHe provided statistics from the Global Malaria Report of 2023 to illustrate the magnitude of the malaria burden, particularly in the WHO African region, highlighting countries contributing to the increase in cases.\n\nHe acknowledged challenges such as climate change and humanitarian emergencies but expressed hope and optimism about the progress made in malaria control and prevention efforts.\n\nWhile citing initiatives like signing the Yaound\u00e9 Declaration and organizing upcoming roundtable meetings, he recognized the government's commitment to fighting malaria.\n\n\"The fight against malaria is not just a health issue but also a matter of social justice and human rights,\" he stressed, emphasizing the importance of expanding access to interventions and improving health systems.\n\nHe, therefore, urged collective action, innovation, and unwavering commitment to overcome challenges and achieve the shared goal of a malaria-free future for all.\n\nHe further reiterated WHO's commitment to continuing partnership with the Federal Ministry of Health/National Malaria Elimination Program (FMoH/NMEP) and other malaria partners through the provision of technical support and guidance to meet national goals.\n\nThe Chairman of the 2024 World Malaria Day Planning Committee, Dr. Gbenga Jokodola, emphasized the critical need for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of fever suspected to be malaria.\n\nJokodola highlighted the importance of confirming whether the fever is due to malaria through testing and then administering the appropriate medication, which includes artemisinin-based combination therapy drugs.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of fake malaria drugs and stressed the importance of ensuring that patients receive the correct medication in the proper manner.\n\nAdditionally, he underscored the significance of building capacity among healthcare providers and stakeholders to enhance the quality of healthcare delivery.\n\nHe advocated for early presentation at health facilities to receive timely and appropriate treatment, emphasizing the importance of effective primary healthcare services.\n\nDr. Michael Adekunle, CEO of Roll Back Malaria, highlighted the crucial need for accurate data to understand the true extent of malaria cases in Nigeria, underscoring that without proper data, effective interventions cannot be implemented.\n\nAdekunle advocated for a holistic approach to healthcare that involves strengthening the entire health system, including infrastructure, data collection, surveillance, and interventions for diseases like malaria, HIV, and TB.\n\nRecognizing the significant role of youth in combating malaria, he stressed the importance of engaging them in efforts to eradicate the disease.\n\n\"We have proposed the establishment of a youth force to support malaria elimination initiatives at the community level.\n\n\"It is time to take advantage of the active involvement of youth in the fight against malaria in Nigeria,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune Online"},

Malaria has long been a significant health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. While many people are familiar with the basics of malaria, there's a lot more to learn about this complex disease.\n\nHere are 10 things you probably didn't know about malaria:\n\n1. Malaria's Impact: Malaria continues to be a major global health concern, with approximately 241 million cases and 627,000 deaths reported in 2020, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The majority of these cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, but the disease also affects parts of South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.\n\n2. The Plasmodium Parasite: Malaria is caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus. There are five known species that can infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. P. falciparum is the most deadly, responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths.\n\n3. Transmission Through Mosquitoes: Malaria is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. These mosquitoes are most active during dusk and dawn, making these times particularly risky for malaria transmission.\n\n4. Historical Context: Malaria has a long history, with evidence of the disease dating back thousands of years. Ancient texts from China and Greece mention symptoms consistent with malaria. The term \"malaria\" itself comes from the Italian words \"mala\" and \"aria,\" meaning \"bad air,\" reflecting an early belief that the disease was spread through foul air or miasmas.\n\n5. Malaria and Climate Change: Climate change may influence malaria transmission patterns. Warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns can expand the habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes, potentially leading to changes in where malaria is most prevalent.\n\n6. Prevention Strategies: Efforts to combat malaria focus on prevention, including the use of insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and antimalarial medications. Bed nets, in particular, have been instrumental in reducing malaria transmission in high-risk regions.\n\n7. Malaria and Pregnancy: Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to malaria. Infection during pregnancy can lead to severe complications, including maternal anaemia, low birth weight, and an increased risk of stillbirth or premature delivery. Preventive treatments and prenatal care are crucial in regions with high malaria prevalence.\n\n8. Drug Resistance: The emergence of drug-resistant strains of malaria poses a significant threat to global malaria control efforts. Resistance to antimalarial drugs like chloroquine and artemisinin has been documented, prompting the need for ongoing research into new treatments and combination therapies.\n\n9. Global Goals and Progress: The WHO's Global Malaria Programme aims to eliminate malaria in at least 35 countries by 2030.

This may not be peculiar to only children as adults also engage in the use of unregulated herbal medicines mainly because of poverty,\" he revealed.\n\nNoting that Malaria remains the most important public health parasitic disease both in Nigeria and the world, Prof Aribodor noted that Nigeria, unfortunately, has the highest malaria burden in the world at over 30% of the global burden, with children under the age of 5 years and pregnant women being the most vulnerable groups for the disease.\n\n\"According to the 2023 World Malaria Report published by the World Health Organisation (W.H.O), one out of every three deaths from malaria in the world occurs in Nigeria, and 22 persons die every hour due to malaria in Nigeria.\n\n\"Malaria is both a preventable and treatable disease caused by parasites known as Plasmodium with Plasmodium falciparum being the most dangerous of the malaria parasites.\n\n\"Malaria parasites are transmitted by an infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, the malaria vectors. Mosquitoes themselves are infected by the environment, especially humans. No mosquito is born with a malaria parasite.\n\n\"The 2023 World Malaria Report puts the global malaria cases at 249 million with over 600 deaths.\n\n\"Since the discovery of the malaria parasite in 1880 in Algeria and its transmission by mosquitoes in 1887, several efforts have been made to control and eliminate the ancient scourge in the world.\n\n\"These efforts involve various vector and parasite control strategies. Current tools available for the control of malaria vectors include sleeping inside long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs), spraying inside of residential houses with indoor residual spraying, and larval control through various strategies including larval source management and environmental control among others. The control of malaria parasites involves the use of various antimalarial medicines both for preventive and curative treatment.\n\n\"The preventive treatment of malaria for children involves seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi); that for pregnant women involves the use of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy popularly called IPTp.\n\n\"The current drug of choice for the treatment of malaria is the artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Various brands of ACT exist in the market but should be taken under medical advice to avoid the problem of drug resistance which compromised the use of the once almighty chloroquine,\" he said.\n\nAribodor, who is a fellow of the Parasitology and Public Health Society of Nigeria, regretted that with all these available tools for the control and elimination of malaria, it is surprising that malaria still kills Nigerians.\n\nHe advised the government to consider free treatment or subsidy on the treatment, which is most commonly-suffered, due to the nature of the environment in the communities.\n\nAribodor posited; \"Both federal and state governments need to intervene to ensure affordable, if not free, malaria treatment and services. Many antimalarial tools are available and should be massively deployed for malaria control and elimination in Nigeria.\n\n\"It therefore becomes imperative to urge community leaders, local government chairmen, state governors, and the Nigerian President to summon the political will to eliminate Malaria from our territories.\n\n\"It is both doable and achievable. Timelines should be set, and technical committees and working groups constituted by civil society organizations and other stakeholders engaged and mobilized for the all-important project.", "source": {"uri": "thenews-chronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Herbal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anambra_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidney failure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium falciparum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parasitic disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Larva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Capital Territory"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Australian Capital Territory"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thenews-chronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ariboor.png?fit=573%2C563&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 287, "textEnd": 298}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Despite tremendous progress made to curb malaria in Africa, it still kills a child every 60 seconds.\n\nThe mosquito-borne infection costs Africa around $12 billion every year and in places where infections are recurring, up to 60% of school children have impaired learning ability.\n\nSouth Africa had more than 7 800 malaria cases last year. Although community transmission is low, an outbreak could put nearly 5 million people in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga at risk of getting the disease. Bringing malaria risk to zero at home will not happen without coordinated malaria control efforts between South Africa, Eswatini and Mozambique (the MOSASWA region).\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund shows us that investment in malaria control falls short of the $7.8 billion needed to stay on target to eliminate it by 2030. This prompted African social benefit organisations to build cross-sectoral networks to take on malaria in southern Africa.\n\nGoodbye Malaria has fought the disease in Mozambique, South Africa and Eswatini for over a decade. Its elimination campaigns, including the use of eight mobile units for testing and treatment at key border posts in South Africa and awareness drives, has kept more than 4 million people in the MOSASWA region malaria-free in 2023. A form of vector control called indoor residual spray (IRS) is also key to its success. Vector control means an intervention that stops the disease spreading from carrier mosquitoes to humans.\n\nTo eliminate malaria \"you need to halt local transmission in a community,\" says Sherwin Charles, CEO of Goodbye Malaria. He adds that only when local transmission has stopped for three years will an area be declared malaria-free.\n\n\"We are not winning the war against this disease. Malaria is having a devastating effect, particularly on children on the continent. Protecting them from it needs to become a way of life,\" says Charles.\n\nUnderstanding malaria mechanisms\n\nThis life-threatening disease spreads to humans through specific types of mosquitoes that are infected by parasites in tropical countries. Early signs of malaria are fever, headaches, and chills within the first 10-15 days of being bitten by an infected mosquito.\n\nThese symptoms are difficult to recognise as malaria and they can become severe or lead to death within 24 hours. This makes prevention tools essential to fight malaria - particularly in areas that do not have public health infrastructure.\n\nWhy prevention is paramount\n\nStrategies to end malaria need to be comprehensive. Malaria nets alone will not prevent all infections because mosquitoes can bite people before they are under one. Medications also aren't perfect because \"more drug-resistant kinds of malaria are emerging and they just don't respond to treatment,\" says Charles. When used together, insecticide-treated nets, medication and IRS, are all tools that improve efforts to control malaria.\n\nGoodbye Malaria deploys teams of trained professionals to spray WHO approved insecticide in homes located in high-transmission areas. The goal is for malaria-spreading mosquitoes to die when they land on surfaces in the home.\n\nA coordinated effort\n\nMalaria vaccines are another valuable tool to curb the disease because they are effective at preparing children for the worst symptoms. Both RTS and R21 jabs significantly reduce severe malaria and death among young children. But the WHO estimates that at least 60 million doses of malaria vaccine will be needed in Africa by 2026.\n\n\"You can't work in silos to solve this problem,\" adds Charles. In his view, suppressing malaria means you need \"partners who are willing to do the hard work.\"\n\nEven though Africa avoided almost 10 million malaria deaths over the past two decades, Charles says more collaborative approaches across government, business and non-profit sectors are needed to end malaria.\n\nGoodbye Malaria leads by example by establishing innovative partnerships with organisations like Nando's, Vodacom, Vitality Health International, Airports Company South Africa and Envu. \"Partnerships present opportunities to make a significant impact in the fight against malaria, allowing us to move faster, together,\" he says.\n\n\"It's the only way we're going to win the war,\" says Charles. \"Ending malaria not only saves lives, it unlocks human potential. Malaria is a disease of poverty and results in poverty. By investing in prevention and elimination we are investing in healthier and more prosperous societies.\"\n\nSherwin Charles, CEO of GoodBye Malaria", "source": {"uri": "georgeherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "George Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eswatini"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southern Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mozambique"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vector control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limpopo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Limpopo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpumalanga", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mpumalanga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mpumalanga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaria vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cms.groupeditors.com/img/90d93981-a86f-4cf5-83ee-8ee36009b44c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Early malaria often mimics a mild flu, with fever, chills, and headaches. These symptoms can be subtle, especially in regions where malaria is common and people may have some immunity (asymptomatic infections).\n\nMalaria prevention\n\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding travelling to places where the disease is high - like tropical and sub-tropical areas.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 malaria deaths in 85 countries in 2022 globally.\n\nEvery year April 25 is marked as World Malaria Day to signify the efforts to end the disease from the root and spread awareness among people. The theme for this year is \"Accelerate the fight against malaria for a more equitable world.\"\n\nThe WHO maintains that malaria is preventable and curable. But how long does it take to recover from malaria? According to experts, it takes about two weeks of treatment to be cured of malaria. However, in some individuals, relapses are possible.\n\nWorld Malaria Day 2024: How to recover from malaria quickly?\n\nRecovery from malaria requires a combination of medical treatment, proper rest, and supportive care. Dr Anurag Aggarwal, Consultant, Internal Medicine, Fortis Escorts Hospital Faridabad highlights essential steps to recover quickly from malaria:\n\n\"Recovery time can vary depending on the individual's general health, the type of malaria, and how quickly treatment was initiated. While some may start feeling better within a week, others may take longer to fully recover. Remember, malaria can recur, so maintaining preventive measures and monitoring for symptoms is important, especially if you're in or have recently traveled to high-risk areas,\" Dr Aggarwal told Financial Express.com.\n\nWorld Malaria Day 2024: How to prevent malaria?\n\nTo protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should follow these tips:\n\n\"People need to ensure that there is no stagnant water or discarded pots and coconut shells around their homes, as this can be a fertile breeding ground for mosquitoes and enhance the risk of people getting affected by malaria. Infants and young children are most vulnerable. Pregnancy reduces immunity so expecting mothers should be careful and take necessary precautions to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes. Fever with sweating or chills, headache and muscle ache, fatigue, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are some of the symptoms of malaria. If these symptoms persist for more than two days, patients must visit a general physician,\" Dr Adarsh Nayak, General Physician, Trilife Hospital said.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "health_desk@financialexpress.com", "name": "Health Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoskeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exoskeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mosquito-g2ec1f4bbd_1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 501, "textEnd": 509}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The World Health Organization - WHO sees it as a \"life-threatening\" disease spread by an infected female anopheles mosquito which is usually common in tropical countries like Nigeria.\n\nStatistically, the WHO malaria facts & statistics revealed that there were 249 million malaria cases in 2022, with a record of 608,000 malaria deaths. In 2021, a record of 247 million cases were reported globally.\n\nIn Africa, the WHO estimated that about 94% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa- most especially children under the age of 5 which implies that malaria is partly responsible for the high mortality rate in Africa.\n\nAccording to the report on Malaria in Nigeria 2020 by WHO estimated 68 million cases and 194,000 deaths due to the disease in 2021. Nigeria has the highest burden of malaria globally, accounting for nearly one-third of the world's annual 619,000 malaria deaths, accounting for about 32% of the global malaria burden in 2021.\n\nThese figures highlight the ongoing challenge we face in combating malaria and the urgent need for greater efforts to control and prevent its spread.\n\nMalaria is preventable and curable. Unlike other diseases, malaria is caused by a parasite and does not spread from one person to another.\n\nSymptoms can also be mild or life-threatening which include; chills, fever and sweating, fatigue, pain in the muscles or abdomen, malaise, nausea or vomiting, severe headache, and fast heart rate.\n\nWhen diagnosed with malaria, symptoms can be cured within 2 weeks. But people who live in mosquito-infested areas may never fully recover, especially malnourished children.\n\nHowever, if left untreated, it can become fatal. This means it can lead to severe health problems such as seizures, brain damage, difficulty in breathing, organ failure, and finally death.\n\nInfants and young children, especially those under five, are particularly affected, with disparities in access to education and financial resources compounding their risk.\n\nPregnant women also face heightened risks, as pregnancy reduces immunity to malaria, making them more susceptible to infection and severe disease. Without timely and appropriate intervention, malaria in pregnancy can have devastating consequences, including severe anemia, maternal death, stillbirth, premature delivery, and low-birth-weight babies.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people infected with malaria should seek immediate treatment so that the mortality rate can be drastically reduced.\n\nCDC also advises that one of the most effective ways of battling the disease is by adopting preventive measures which suggest avoiding being bitten by mosquitoes by sleeping under a mosquito net, using mosquitoes/ insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants (wearing permethrin-treated clothing) as well as keeping the environment clean and healthy so that there are no breeding places for mosquitoes to thrive.\n\nIn recent years, global efforts have been made to reduce the prevalence of malaria which poses a serious threat to public health and exacerbates inequalities within communities. However, remarkable efforts have been made in eradicating malaria most especially with the emergence of the vaccine.\n\nNigeria, a country that greatly suffers from malaria, has recently approved a promising vaccine known as R21. This vaccine has shown significant potential in early trials, with up to 80% of vaccinated children remaining free from malaria.\n\nThe approval of the R21 vaccine is anticipated to bring hope for reducing the burden of this disease and saving countless lives in the country.", "source": {"uri": "nigerianobservernews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nigerian Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tachycardia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malnutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

While more progress can be achieved with currently available tools, new interventions are needed to accelerate the gains and counter emerging threats.\n\nThe new operational strategy is also guided by three equity-oriented principles of country ownership and leadership, with a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.\n\nDirector of the Global Malaria Programme, Dr Daniel Ngamije, said that in recent years, progress towards critical targets of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for malaria 2016-2030 has been stalled, particularly in countries that carry a high burden of the disease.\n\nHe observed that in 2022, there were an estimated 608,000 malaria-related deaths and 249 million new malaria cases globally, with young children in Africa bearing the brunt of the disease.\n\nNgamije stated that millions of people continue to miss out on the services they need to prevent, detect, and treat malaria adding that progress in global malaria control has been hampered by resource constraints, humanitarian crises, climate change and biological threats such as drug and insecticide resistance.\n\nAccording to him, a shift in the global malaria response is urgently needed across the entire malaria ecosystem to prevent avoidable deaths and achieve the targets of the WHO global malaria strategy.\n\nHe said: \"This shift should seek to address the root causes of the disease and be centred around accessibility, efficiency, sustainability, equity and integration.\"\n\nWHO Global Malaria Programme has an important role to play in leading the response to control and eliminate the disease worldwide. Through its direct actions and networks, including a presence in 150 countries, the programme is well placed to shape the malaria ecosystem and achieve impact at the country level.\n\nAccording to the WHO, efforts to fight malaria must be fully owned and led by countries with adequate investment of domestic resources and a multisectoral response.\n\nThe UN body noted that a country-led response further promotes inclusive governance, accountability and specific interventions that are tailored to local contexts resilient health systems to enable the success of national malaria responses. Ensuring the provision of malaria services relies on a strong primary healthcare system that can respond to emerging needs and provide quality care for all people, including those infected with malaria.\n\nWHO observed that all efforts to fight malaria should be rooted in the principles of equity, gender equity and human rights to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected and have access to quality health services, including malaria interventions and information.\n\nEquity in access to malaria services is the focus of the year's World Malaria Day under the theme: \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world.\" It is also a central tenet of the Yaound\u00e9 Declaration, signed in March 2024 by African Ministers of Health from some of the countries hardest hit by malaria,\" Ngamije added.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Daniel-Ngamije-640x360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

As malaria continues to pose a significant global health threat, the 2022 World Malaria Report indicates a disturbing stagnation in progress towards the global malaria targets to effectively reduce the cases till complete eradication.\n\nThe report estimated 608,000 deaths and 249 million new cases of malaria worldwide in the previous year, emphasising the disease's relentless grip, particularly on young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, and other marginalised groups like refugees, migrants and indigenous populations.\n\nThe Persistent Burden of Malaria\n\nDespite being preventable and treatable, malaria's burden is heaviest on those least able to bear it: the young, the impoverished and the displaced. Dr. Ngamije directed that moral and practical factors are imperative to enhance support for these groups, not only to alleviate their suffering but also to advance global health security.\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of malaria cases and deaths occur, socio-economic disparities aggravate the disease's impact, targeting the ones on the lower end of the spectrum. Children under five, who are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases, suffer disproportionately. This vulnerability is compounded in areas plagued by poverty and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, where access to preventive measures like insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and effective malaria treatment is limited and close to none.\n\nHigh Burden to High Impact Initiative\n\nThe WHO and the RBM Partnership have spearheaded the \"High Burden to High Impact\" (HBHI) initiative, focusing on countries weighing the highest malaria burden. The initiative advocates for a data-driven approach, targeting interventions to reach the most affected first. This strategy was reinforced by the recent signing of the 'Yaound\u00e9 Declaration' by the Health Ministers from HBHI countries, pledging to accelerate efforts and address the root causes of malaria's persistence, including barriers related to gender and financial limitations within the affected communities.\n\nThe Drive Towards Malaria Elimination\n\nThe fight against malaria also extends to regions with lower incidence, where elimination is within reach but still challenged by persistent inequities. Mobile populations, such as migrant workers and refugees, often face significant barriers to accessing malaria prevention and treatment services. These groups are frequently overlooked whilst considering overall health planning, a gap that must be closed to achieve the elimination of malaria.\n\nInnovative Tools and Strategies for Universal Health Coverage and Being Equipped for Elimination\n\nRecent years have seen promising developments in the fight against high-risk populations to malaria, including the introduction of dual-active ingredient nets and the development of malaria vaccines. These tools represent significant advancements in malaria prevention, particularly if they can actively be deployed in an equitable manner, championed by the WHO, furthering the cause.\n\nMoreover, the WHO Global Malaria Program has recently launched a new operational strategy that aims to integrate health equity, gender equality and human rights into all aspects of malaria response. This strategy emphasises the ardent need for primary healthcare systems that ensure universal health coverage, making health services available and affordable for all, particularly the marginalised and disadvantaged.\n\nDr. Ngamije reiterates the role of universal health coverage (UHC) saying it should not be a privilege but a right. \"By reorienting health systems towards primary health care, we can achieve the most inclusive, equitable, and cost-effective way to implement UHC,\" he adds.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Global Commitment\n\nCommunity involvement is crucial in the battle against malaria. Local communities can help identify and address specific barriers to access and adherence to malaria interventions. For instance, engaging community leaders in malaria education can significantly increase the uptake of preventive measures like ITN usage. Furthermore, global solidarity and sustained funding are essential. International donors and local governments need to maintain and increase funding for malaria programs, especially in high-burden countries, ensuring that 'no one is left behind'. The global community's commitment to malaria eradication was evident in the substantial turnout and discussions at the recent 8th Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) Society Conference in Kigali, Rwanda, which focused on innovative strategies to combat the disease.\n\nAs we commemorate World Malaria Day 2024, the commitment to a more equitable approach in the fight against malaria is clear. However, significant challenges remain.\n\nTo truly accelerate progress, a multi-faceted strategy that includes robust community engagement, sustained political will and innovative health technologies must be employed. Every effort counts in the fight to end malaria, ensuring that no one, regardless of where they live or how much they earn, must face the threat of malaria alone.

With support from World Health Organization (WHO) and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, Ghana undertook the HBHI approach, which is a targeted mechanism of activities and interventions for effective malaria control, towards elimination of the disease.\n\nThe approach has enabled Ghana to adopt tailored measures and optimize the use of existing tools for the reduction of malaria-related deaths.\n\nThe country has managed to reduce the rates of malaria parasite prevalence in children younger than five, from 20.6% in 2016, to 8.6% by 2023 according to the Ghana Demographic Health Survey.

The Organization also supported the strengthening of malaria surveillance, monitoring and evaluation, including malaria risk stratification.\n\n\"The data shows that our strategy against malaria has been effective. We will continue to work with partners to ensure that we build on this momentum to consolidate the gains towards malaria elimination in Ghana,\" says Dr Keziah L. Malm, the Ghana National Malaria Elimination Programme Manager.\n\nThe most recent boost for Ghana's malaria efforts was the launch of the National Malaria Strategic Elimination Plan 2024-2028, a blueprint to accelerate progress towards malaria elimination.\n\nDr Frank Lule, Acting WHO Representative in Ghana, attributes the progress against malaria to the multi-pronged strategy.\n\n\"The use of indoor residual spraying, treated mosquito nets and now the malaria vaccine, has strengthened Ghana's malaria control toolbox and is beginning to show dividends,\" he noted.\n\nThe multi-strategy response also ensures the advancement of health and gender equity, and human rights, with vulnerable populations being prioritized. All malaria preventive and chemopreventive interventions in Ghana are free for children younger than five and pregnant women. Children of all ages have also benefited from the distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs), offering protection to families from malaria-causing mosquitos.\n\n\"Ghana's approach to the fight against malaria has been anchored on leaving no one behind. We continue to actively provide technical support to the country's efforts to protect the most vulnerable from the threats of malaria,\" noted Dr Felicia Owusu-Antwi, National Professional Officer for Malaria, Vector-Born and Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nFor mothers like Damoah and Anno, Ghana's efforts against malaria has also reflected in their improved knowledge of malaria preventive measures, which they believe has been key to protecting their families.\n\n\"Now, I regularly sleep under treated mosquito nets with my children and whilst also ensuring that environment does not breed mosquitos,\" says Damoah. \"I encourage every parent to follow all the advice of the health workers to protect their families\".\n\nThe Africa region continues to shoulder the highest burden of malaria globally, accounting for 94% of all malaria cases (233 million) and 95% of all malaria deaths (580 000) in 2022.\n\nWith the recent certification of Cabo Verde as malaria-free, and Ghana's progress towards elimination, there is cause for optimism, says Dr Dorothy Achu, Team Lead for Tropical and Vector-Born Diseases at WHO Africa, noting that these achievements reflect strengthened malaria control efforts regionally.\n\n\"Cabo Verde and Ghana have demonstrated that sustained commitment is key to the malaria control agenda.

We will continue to work with partners to ensure that we build on this momentum to consolidate the gains towards malaria elimination in Ghana,\" says Dr Keziah L. Malm, the Ghana National Malaria Elimination Programme Manager.\n\nThe most recent boost for Ghana's malaria efforts was the launch of the National Malaria Strategic Elimination Plan 2024-2028, a blueprint to accelerate progress towards malaria elimination.\n\nDr Frank Lule, Acting WHO Representative in Ghana, attributes the progress against malaria to the multi-pronged strategy.\n\n\"The use of indoor residual spraying, treated mosquito nets and now the malaria vaccine, has strengthened Ghana's malaria control toolbox and is beginning to show dividends,\" he noted.\n\nThe multi-strategy response also ensures the advancement of health and gender equity, and human rights, with vulnerable populations being prioritized. All malaria preventive and chemopreventive interventions in Ghana are free for children younger than five and pregnant women. Children of all ages have also benefited from the distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLINs), offering protection to families from malaria-causing mosquitos.\n\n\"Ghana's approach to the fight against malaria has been anchored on leaving no one behind. We continue to actively provide technical support to the country's efforts to protect the most vulnerable from the threats of malaria,\" noted Dr Felicia Owusu-Antwi, National Professional Officer for Malaria, Vector-Born and Neglected Tropical Diseases.\n\nFor mothers like Damoah and Anno, Ghana's efforts against malaria has also reflected in their improved knowledge of malaria preventive measures, which they believe has been key to protecting their families.\n\n\"Now, I regularly sleep under treated mosquito nets with my children and whilst also ensuring that environment does not breed mosquitos,\" says Damoah. \"I encourage every parent to follow all the advice of the health workers to protect their families\".\n\nThe Africa region continues to shoulder the highest burden of malaria globally, accounting for 94% of all malaria cases (233 million) and 95% of all malaria deaths (580 000) in 2022.\n\nWith the recent certification of Cabo Verde as malaria-free, and Ghana's progress towards elimination, there is cause for optimism, says Dr Dorothy Achu, Team Lead for Tropical and Vector-Born Diseases at WHO Africa, noting that these achievements reflect strengthened malaria control efforts regionally.\n\n\"Cabo Verde and Ghana have demonstrated that sustained commitment is key to the malaria control agenda. In line with our commitment to Ending disease in Africa, WHO will continue to support the maintenance and scale-up of malaria control interventions across the region,\" she says.\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of World Health Organization (WHO), Ghana.", "source": {"uri": "capitalethiopia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Ethiopia Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoprophylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemoprophylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indoor residual spraying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunyani", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunyani"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunyani"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS,S", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RTS,S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stratification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neglected_tropical_diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neglected tropical diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 56}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The commitment of governments and development partners is bearing fruit as malaria prevalence is declining significantly,\" Onditi told Xinhua in a virtual interview.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) statistics show that in 2022, the African region was home to 94 percent of the world's malaria cases, or 233 million cases, and 95 percent, or 580,000 malaria deaths.\n\nIn addition, children under the age of five accounted for about 80 percent of all malaria deaths on the continent, according to the WHO, while the tropical disease continued to pose a significant threat to the lives of pregnant women.\n\nOnditi noted that while much progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of malaria in Africa, the disease -- which is brought on by a plasmodium that mosquitoes carry -- remains a threat to the well-being and livelihoods of rural communities across the continent.\n\nAccording to Onditi, the climate crisis is fueling malaria infections in non-endemic parts of the continent, while mosquito resistance to treated nets and the emergence of new strains could slow efforts to eliminate the disease in Africa.\n\nThis year's World Malaria Day theme, \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,\" underscores the need for Africa to put equity at the center of the fight against the disease, Onditi said.\n\nOnditi emphasized that the continent's goal of malaria elimination can be achieved through increased inter-agency collaboration and the involvement of community health promoters in the deployment of novel prevention and treatment tools.\n\nHe added that expanding indoor residual spraying in high-endemic zones, coupled with accelerating vaccination for children and robust case management, will be key to taming the malaria

But across the continent, malaria never goes away, killing and sickening millions of people.\n\nTake Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal area in Lagos, Nigeria. Dirty water ponds provide favorable breeding conditions for mosquitoes that spread malaria. Kotun cannot afford insecticide-treated bed nets, which cost between $7 and $21 each, much less anti-malarial drugs and treatments.\n\nAhead of World Malaria Day on Thursday, here's what you need to know about the situation in Africa.\n\nMalaria parasites are spread to people primarily through infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, and chills. It primarily affects children under the age of 5 and pregnant women. The vaccine effort is still in its early stages, and Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely vaccinate children with a new malaria vaccine, but it is only about 30% effective at stopping transmission. It is not possible. A second vaccine was recently approved.\n\nCases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding for innovation by governments and donors is slowing.\n\nLiving conditions play a role, with many regions experiencing problems such as crowded areas, stagnant water, poor sanitation, and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials. And invasive mosquito species, previously found mainly in India and the Persian Gulf, are a new concern.\n\nMalaria cases are increasing worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, the number of infected people has increased from 233 million in 2019 to 249 million in 85 countries in 2022. The number of deaths due to malaria increased from 576,000 in 2019 to 608,000 in 2022.\n\nOf the 12 countries responsible for approximately 70% of the world's malaria burden, 11 are in Africa and one is India. Of the 580,000 malaria deaths recorded in Africa in 2022, 80% were children under five.\n\nWhile some progress has been made in the fight against malaria in areas such as rapid diagnostic tests, vaccines and new bed nets to combat insecticide resistance, the COVID-19 pandemic and focus Changes in funding set back the effort.\n\nA study published last year in the journal Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases said COVID-19 lockdowns had disrupted 30% of rural community health service hubs across Africa. The number of malaria infections has started to rise rapidly again, breaking the downward trend from 2000 to 2019.\n\nAccording to the WHO, this downward trend could soon reverse.\n\nAfrica is \"in the midst of climate change\" and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events is wreaking havoc on malaria control in low- and middle-income regions, said Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS. Stated. Tuberculosis and malaria, warning for December.\n\nIn 2023, the WHO's Global Malaria Report included for the first time a chapter on the link between malaria and climate change, highlighting the importance of malaria as a potential risk multiplier. Scientists are concerned that people living in areas that were once inhospitable to mosquitoes, such as the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and the mountains of eastern Ethiopia, could be exposed to the mosquitoes.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, which recorded its hottest day in decades, the transmission period for malaria is increasing in some areas, and \"this change is due to climate change,\" said Precious Andi, WHO's malaria specialist in Zimbabwe.

This welcome commitment reflects the world's urgent need for greater resources and resolve to meet the goal of ending this ancient scourge as a major public health threat by 2030.\"\n\nThe $30 million investment includes $5 million to James Cook University to support Pacific countries to strengthen surveillance and control of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue and zika. A new $8 million partnership with non-government health organisation PATH, in a consortium with Australia's Burnet Institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, will also help develop new diagnostic tests targeted to our region.\n\nThe Commonwealth is also partnering with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, providing $17 million for the development of new malaria treatments including medicines suitable for use in pregnancy and for children.\n\nGlobal progress in combating malaria is under threat due to conflict, climate change, and increasing resistance to insecticides, with nearly half the world's population at risk - including 2 billion people in our region. In 2022 alone, there were 10 million cases in the Asia-Pacific Region - a two million increase from 2021. Globally, 608,000 people died from malaria, the majority among children under the age of five. Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to the disease.\n\nDespite these challenges, the world is making significant strides. In the last two decades, the Global Fund, which is the main funder of malaria eradication programs, has invested more than US$17.9 billion in malaria control programs, providing 65% of all international financing for such programs. Since January 2021, the Global Fund has increased malaria grants by an average of 23%.\n\nProfessor Crabb said: \"Highly effective tools exist to prevent malaria ravaging families and communities. These include insecticide-treated mosquito nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention for children under five, preventive treatment during pregnancy, indoor residual spraying, and robust testing and treatment protocols. We know these methods work and when they are equitably distributed, they are powerfully effective.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Global Fund distributed 220 million mosquito nets, covered 8.5 million structures with indoor residual spraying, provided seasonal malaria chemoprevention to 37.1 million children, and ensured that 14.6 million pregnant women received preventive therapy for malaria. Additionally, 321 million suspected cases of malaria were tested, and 166 million cases were treated.\n\nScientific innovation is driving further progress. For example, new mosquito nets using two insecticides are dramatically more effective than single-insecticide nets. Moreover, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance began rolling out the first ever and long-awaited malaria vaccine, whilst a second vaccine received recommendation for use in late 2023. These vaccines, when deployed alongside existing tools and as part of comprehensive national malaria control plans, are helping to accelerate action to get back on track to defeat the disease.\n\nInvestment in community health workers who bring lifesaving malaria prevention and care services to those who need them most is also highly effective. These investments benefit the health system more widely, as community health workers are trained to diagnose and treat diseases beyond malaria and to incorporate malaria prevention measures alongside other health care services.\n\n\"Today, a child dies from malaria every minute,\" Professor Crabb said. \"By harnessing the power of new and existing tools to fight malaria and ensuring equitable access to game-changing innovations, we can prevent infections and deaths and get closer to ending malaria by 2030. We urge the Australian Government to maintain its commitment to achieve this goal.\"\n\nSource & references /Public Release.", "source": {"uri": "nationaltribune.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnet_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burnet Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zika fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(global_health_organization)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PATH (global health organization)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Order of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Cook University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indoor residual spraying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://c.nationaltribune.com.au/wp-content/themes/news/images/news-image-default.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The vaccine rollout, announced on World Malaria Day, seeks to further scale up vaccine deployment in the African region.\n\nToday's launch brings to eight the number of countries on the continent to offer the malaria vaccine as part of the childhood immunization programmes, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Several of the more than 30 countries in the African region that have expressed interest in the vaccine are scheduled to roll it out in the next year through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as efforts continue to widen its deployment in the region in coordination with other prevention measures such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention.\n\nBenin, which received 215 900 doses, has added the malaria vaccine to its Expanded Programme on Immunization. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from around 5 months of age.\n\n\"The introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge. I would like to reassure that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against this serious and fatal diseases,\" said Prof Benjamin Hounkpatin, Minister of Health of Benin.\n\nIn Liberia, the vaccine was launched in the southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterwards in five other counties which have high malaria burden. At least 45 000 children are expected to benefit from the 112 000 doses of the available vaccine.\n\n\"For far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children. But today, with this vaccine and the unwavering commitment of our communities, healthcare workers and our partners, including GAVI, UNICEF and WHO, we break the chain. We have a powerful tool that will protect them from this devastating illness and related deaths, ensuring their right to health and a brighter future. Let's end malaria in Liberia and pave the way for a healthier, more just society,\" said Dr Louise Kpoto, Liberia's Minister of Health.\n\nTwo safe and effective vaccines -- RTS,S and R21 -- recommended by World Health Organization (WHO), are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control. A pilot malaria vaccine programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi reached over 2 million children from 2019 to 2023, showing a significant reduction in malaria illness and a 13% drop in overall child mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550\u202f000 vaccine doses. The vaccine will then be delivered in health facilities nationwide.\n\n\"With the new, safe and efficacious malaria vaccine, we now have an additional tool to fight this disease. In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection,\" said Dr Austin Demby, Minister of Health of Sierra Leone.\n\nMalaria remains a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the World Malaria Report 2023.\n\n\"The African region is advancing in the rollout of the malaria vaccine - a game-changer in our fight against this deadly disease,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \"Working with our member states and partners, we're supporting the ongoing efforts to save the lives of young children and lower the malaria burden in the region.\"\n\nAurelia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, noted: \"Today we celebrate more children gaining access to a new lifesaving tool to fight one of Africa's deadliest diseases. This introduction of malaria vaccines into routine programmes in Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone alongside other proven interventions will help save lives and offer relief to families, communities and hard-pressed health systems.\"\n\nProgress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including climate change, humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge.\n\nTo put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to addressing delays in malaria programme implementation.\n\nRelated links\n\nPress release in French

Malaria continues to pose a significant public health challenge, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare and resources. While progress has been made in reducing malaria incidence and mortality rates, much work remains to be done.\n\nEvery year on April 25th, the World Health Organization (WHO) marks World Malaria Day to raise awareness about this preventable and treatable disease. This year's theme, \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,\" highlights the ongoing battle to eradicate malaria and ensure everyone has access to prevention and treatment.\n\nMalaria transmission is heavily influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. Regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where mosquitoes thrive, are at a higher risk of malaria transmission. Additionally, areas with poor drainage and sanitation are more likely to harbour mosquito breeding sites, further increasing the risk.\n\nChildren under five years old and adults over 65 years old are particularly susceptible to severe malaria and its complications. Their developing or weakened immune systems make them more vulnerable to infection and severe illness, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to protect these age groups.\n\nPregnant women are at an increased risk of malaria due to changes in their immune system and the presence of placental malaria, which can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the unborn child. Preventive measures such as intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets are essential to safeguard the health of pregnant women and their babies.\n\nPopulation movements, whether due to migration, travel, or displacement, play a significant role in the spread of malaria. People travelling from areas with high malaria transmission rates to non-endemic regions can introduce the disease to new areas, potentially triggering outbreaks. Additionally, migrant workers living in temporary settlements with inadequate housing and sanitation are particularly vulnerable to malaria.\n\nStagnant water bodies, such as ponds, puddles, and uncovered water containers, serve as ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, particularly the Anopheles species, which transmit malaria. Communities with inadequate waste management and water drainage systems are at a heightened risk of mosquito breeding and subsequent malaria transmission.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunodeficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunodeficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harbor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drainage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Placenta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/04/malaria-1714028971.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 406, "textEnd": 416}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

This welcome commitment reflects the world's urgent need for greater resources and resolve to meet the goal of ending this ancient scourge as a major public health threat by 2030.\"\n\nThe $30 million investment includes $5 million to James Cook University to support Pacific countries to strengthen surveillance and control of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue and zika. A new $8 million partnership with non-government health organisation PATH, in a consortium with Australia's Burnet Institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, will also help develop new diagnostic tests targeted to our region.\n\nThe Commonwealth is also partnering with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, providing $17 million for the development of new malaria treatments including medicines suitable for use in pregnancy and for children.\n\nGlobal progress in combating malaria is under threat due to conflict, climate change, and increasing resistance to insecticides, with nearly half the world's population at risk - including 2 billion people in our region. In 2022 alone, there were 10 million cases in the Asia-Pacific Region - a two million increase from 2021. Globally, 608,000 people died from malaria, the majority among children under the age of five. Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to the disease.\n\nDespite these challenges, the world is making significant strides. In the last two decades, the Global Fund, which is the main funder of malaria eradication programs, has invested more than US$17.9 billion in malaria control programs, providing 65% of all international financing for such programs. Since January 2021, the Global Fund has increased malaria grants by an average of 23%.\n\nProfessor Crabb said: \"Highly effective tools exist to prevent malaria ravaging families and communities. These include insecticide-treated mosquito nets, seasonal malaria chemoprevention for children under five, preventive treatment during pregnancy, indoor residual spraying, and robust testing and treatment protocols. We know these methods work and when they are equitably distributed, they are powerfully effective.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Global Fund distributed 220 million mosquito nets, covered 8.5 million structures with indoor residual spraying, provided seasonal malaria chemoprevention to 37.1 million children, and ensured that 14.6 million pregnant women received preventive therapy for malaria. Additionally, 321 million suspected cases of malaria were tested, and 166 million cases were treated.\n\nScientific innovation is driving further progress. For example, new mosquito nets using two insecticides are dramatically more effective than single-insecticide nets. Moreover, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance began rolling out the first ever and long-awaited malaria vaccine, whilst a second vaccine received recommendation for use in late 2023. These vaccines, when deployed alongside existing tools and as part of comprehensive national malaria control plans, are helping to accelerate action to get back on track to defeat the disease.\n\nInvestment in community health workers who bring lifesaving malaria prevention and care services to those who need them most is also highly effective. These investments benefit the health system more widely, as community health workers are trained to diagnose and treat diseases beyond malaria and to incorporate malaria prevention measures alongside other health care services.\n\n\"Today, a child dies from malaria every minute,\" Professor Crabb said. \"By harnessing the power of new and existing tools to fight malaria and ensuring equitable access to game-changing innovations, we can prevent infections and deaths and get closer to ending malaria by 2030. We urge the Australian Government to maintain its commitment to achieve this goal.\"\n\n/Public Release.

a preventable and treatable disease.\n\nEach year on April 25, the NICD joins the global community in recognising World Malaria Day.\n\nThis year's theme will focus on 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world'.\n\nThe NICD said that in South Africa, cases of malaria are associated either with local transmission of the malaria parasite in areas of the Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, or exposure to malaria parasites in travellers to other endemic regions returning to South Africa.\n\nAccording to a report on malaria case trends based on notifications captured through the Notifiable Medical Conditions Surveillance System (NMC-SS) from September 2022 to August 2023, the majority of malaria cases in South Africa came from the malaria-endemic province of Limpopo.\n\nData reveals that 5 813 cases were recorded of which 2 845 were logged in Limpopo.\n\nMeanwhile, Gauteng reported the second-highest number of cases, all of which were associated with imported malaria.\n\nIn contrast, the national public health institute said KwaZulu-Natal reported the lowest number of infections sitting at 424 among the endemic provinces.\n\n\"In KwaZulu-Natal, nearly all of the cases reported were imported cases, supporting claims that the province is edging closer to halting local transmission of malaria,\" the NICD explained.\n\nAs per the NICD, peaks in malaria notifications typically follow periods of increased national and international travel to malaria-endemic regions.\n\nData also shows that economically active young males, especially those aged between 20 and 39 years, appeared to be the most at risk population group, a trend observed in other low transmission areas.\n\n\"These findings emphasise the importance of targeting young males with messaging during major holidays and strengthening malaria test-and-treat activities along shared international borders.\"\n\nThe NICD's Centre for Emerging Zoonotic and Parasitic Diseases supports the National Department of Health in eradicating locally acquired malaria through several activities.\n\nThese include contributing to malaria surveillance for accurate monitoring of the occurrence of malaria in South Africa and providing technical support to provincial malaria control programmes.\n\nThe centre monitors insecticide resistance in malaria mosquitoes, screens for antimalarial drug and diagnostic resistance, teaches and trains on various aspects of malaria, and supports improved quality control for laboratory testing for malaria.\n\nThe team also leads innovative research, including investigating novel ways to control malaria mosquitoes and assessing the impact of environmental pollutants on malaria mosquitoes lifecycles and their ability to transmit malaria parasites.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs) and further information on malaria prevention is available on the NICD website www.nicd.ac.za. -

Our collective work will contribute to a more equal future.\n\nDespite these efforts, malaria remains a serious global health challenge that takes its heaviest toll on the most vulnerable. Young children living in the poorest families in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by the disease. Pregnant women, refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons and indigenous peoples are among other groups at higher risk of contracting malaria.\n\nMany people continue to miss out on the services and information they need to prevent, detect and treat malaria, particularly those who experience disadvantage, discrimination and exclusion. We must strengthen and increase our support for these populations - not only is it our moral duty, but it is the best way to get back on track to achieve our global malaria targets.\n\nSince 2017, WHO has reported annually World Malaria Report on a stalling of progress towards critical objectives of the global malaria strategy, particularly in countries bearing a high burden of disease. In 2022, malaria killed an estimated 608,000 people worldwide and there were 249 million new cases.\n\nWithout a change in the current trajectory, many people, especially those living in situations of greatest poverty and vulnerability, will continue to die from malaria - a disease that is preventable and treatable.\n\nHealth disparities are hampering efforts to reduce malaria in the countries hardest hit by the disease. Through the High Burden to High Impact (HBHI) approach, catalyzed in 2018 by WHO and the RBM Partnership, countries have tackled malaria by identifying those who suffer most and making a concerted effort to reach them with personalized packages of interventions and services. .\n\nLast month, Ministers of Health from HBHI countries demonstrated further political commitment by signing the Yaound\u00e9 Declaration, in which they pledged to accelerate efforts to reduce malaria deaths in their respective countries.\n\nIn signing the declaration, the ministers committed to address \"sustainably and equitably\" the challenge of malaria. They recognized the importance of addressing the root causes of stalled progress in malaria control, including low access to and inadequate quality of health services, as well as gender and financial barriers within households.\n\nMinisters also committed to the goal of ensuring that all populations at risk of malaria consistently receive the appropriate tools, including those living in hard-to-reach areas and in conflict and humanitarian settings.\n\nHealth disparities are also undermining efforts to complete the last mile on the road to malaria elimination. In many countries with a low malaria burden, cases of the disease are concentrated among vulnerable, hard-to-reach populations such as mobile and migrant workers, refugees and indigenous communities.\n\nReaching, engaging and empowering these populations with targeted, gender-responsive and culturally sensitive interventions and services is an important strategy for achieving our collective vision of a malaria-free world.\n\nResponses to malaria can be strengthened by increasing investment in research and development of new tools that benefit all people at risk of the disease, and especially the poorest and most marginalized populations.\n\nThe tools recommended by WHO should be increased evenly and sustainably. If widely implemented, several innovative tools recommended in recent years -- including dual-active bed nets and malaria vaccines -- will increase health equity for populations at risk of malaria.\n\nWHO remains committed to supporting countries to ensure that any recommended tools are used effectively. Between 2018 and 2023, WHO supported more than 30 countries in the strategic use of data for decision-making and in adapting interventions at sub-national levels.\n\nIn response to ever-increasing financial constraints, WHO, in consultation with national malaria program managers and partners, has also developed a set of guiding principles for prioritizing interventions in resource-limited settings to achieve maximum impact; we will publish these principles in the coming weeks.\n\nAccess to quality health services can also be improved through gender transformative programs that address the many barriers women and girls face, such as lack of decision-making power within households and lower levels of literacy.\n\nThe fight against malaria can be accelerated through a commitment to universal health coverage (UHC). Everyone should have access to the health services they need - when and where they need them, and without facing financial hardship. WHO recommends the reorientation of health systems towards primary health care, which is considered the most comprehensive, equitable and cost-effective way to achieve UHC.\n\nAs you may have seen, the Global Malaria Program launched a new operational strategy ahead of World Malaria Day. The strategy notes that all efforts to combat malaria must be rooted in the principles of health equity, gender equality and human rights to ensure that people in vulnerable situations are protected and have access to quality health services.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease burden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary healthcare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/campaigns---world-malaria-day/world-malaria-day-2024/wmd24-web-banner2-ghana.tmb-1200v.jpg?sfvrsn=67d34386_6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

A new $8 million partnership with non-government health organisation PATH, in a consortium with Australia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Burnet Institute and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, will also help develop new diagnostic tests targeted to our region.\n\n\u00c2\n\nThe Commonwealth is also partnering with the Medicines for Malaria Venture, providing $17 million for the development of new malaria treatments including medicines suitable for use in pregnancy and for children.\n\n\u00c2\n\nGlobal progress in combating malaria is under threat due to conflict, climate change, and increasing resistance to insecticides, with nearly half the world's population at risk - including 2 billion people in our region. In 2022 alone, there were 10 million cases in the Asia-Pacific Region - a two million increase from 2021. Globally, 608,000 people died from malaria, the majority among children under the age of five. Pregnant women and young children are particularly vulnerable to the disease.\n\n\u00c2\n\nDespite these challenges, the world is making significant strides. In the last two decades, the Global Fund, which is the main funder of malaria eradication programs, has invested more than US$17.9 billion in malaria control programs, providing 65% of all international financing for such programs. Since January 2021, the Global Fund has increased malaria grants by an average of 23%.\n\n\u00c2\n\nProfessor Crabb said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHighly effective tools exist to prevent malaria ravaging families and communities.

On World Malaria Day 2024, the World Health Organisation (WHO) joins the RBM partnership to eradicate malaria and other partners in highlighting barriers to health equity, gender equality and human rights in malaria responses worldwide - as well as concrete measures to overcome them.\n\nAccording to the latest report from the WHO, progress has been made in reducing malaria, still too many people are at high risk from the disease. People living in the most vulnerable situations including pregnant women, infants, children under 5 years of age, refugees, migrants, internally displaced people, and indigenous peoples continue to be disproportionately impacted.\n\nClimate change and humanitarian emergencies are displacing populations making them vulnerable to the disease and hindering progress on achieving the vision of a malaria-free world.\n\nWHO recommends prompt diagnosis for anyone with suspected malaria. If Plasmodium falciparum malaria is not treated within 24 hours, the infection can progress to severe illness and death.\n\nThe theme for World Malaria Day 2024 is \"Accelerate the fight against malaria for a more equitable world.\"\n\nWorld Malaria Day is observed on April 25 across the world and an occasion to highlight the need for the prevention and control of malaria. It was established by WHO Member States at the World Health Assembly in 2007.\n\nMalaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasites that spread to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is caused by five parasitic species, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. The first four are specific for humans, while P. knowlesi causes malaria in macaque monkeys.\n\nThe first symptoms usually begin within 10-15 days after the bite from a mosquito. The common symptoms include Fever, headache and chills, which may be mild and difficult to recognise. However, in malaria endemic areas, people who have developed partial immunity may not experience symptoms (asymptomatic infections).\n\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease and is not contagious and cannot spread from one person to another but is only transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes. There are over 400 different species of Anopheles mosquitoes and around 40, known as vector species, can transmit the disease.\n\nMalaria is a treatable disease and it can be treated through early diagnosis and correct medication.

disease.\n\nShe noted that there has been some progress in recent years in the Region, which witnessed a substantial decline in malaria cases and deaths, marking the most significant reduction among all WHO regions.\n\nShe said much progress has been made by countries such as Bhutan, Nepal, and Timor-Leste, demonstrating that with political commitment and collective action, malaria elimination is within reach.\n\nHowever, malaria elimination is far from over, she said.\n\nOn this occasion, WHO calls for renewed attention to the barriers to health equity, gender equality, and human rights in malaria responses.\n\n\"We must redouble our efforts to overcome these challenges and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographical location, have access to life-saving malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment services,\" the regional director said.\n\n\"Moreover, by leveraging digital technology, we can better understand the diverse health needs of populations, collect and analyse data, and monitor progress in real-time, enabling us to identify and address health inequities through proven interventions and innovation in service delivery,\" she

In Africa, it never left", "body": "When a small number of cases of locally transmitted malaria were found in the United States last year, it was a reminder that climate change is reviving or migrating the threat of some diseases. But across the African continent malaria has never left, killing or sickening millions of people.\n\nTake Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal neighborhood in Nigeria's Lagos city. Its ponds of dirty water provide favorable breeding conditions for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Kotun can't afford insecticide-treated bed nets that cost between $7 and $21 each, much less antimalarial medications or treatment.\n\nFor World Malaria Day on Thursday, here is what you need to know about the situation in Africa:\n\nThe malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills. It mostly affects children under 5 and pregnant women. Vaccine efforts are still in early stages: Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine, which is only about 30% effective and doesn't stop transmission. A second vaccine was recently approved.\n\nCases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding by governments and donors for innovation is slowing.\n\nLiving conditions play a role, with crowded neighborhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials all issues in many areas. And an invasive species of mosquito previously seen mostly in India and the Persian Gulf is a new concern.\n\nGlobally, malaria cases are on the rise. Infections increased from 233 million in 2019 to 249 million in 85 countries in 2022. Malaria deaths rose from 576,000 in 2019 to 608,000 in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOf the 12 countries that carry about 70% of the global burden of malaria, 11 are in Africa and the other is India. Children under 5 constituted 80% of the 580,000 malaria deaths recorded in Africa in 2022.\n\nThe fight against malaria saw some progress in areas such as rapid diagnostic tests, vaccines and new bed nets meant to counter insecticide resistance, but the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in focus and funding set back efforts.\n\nA study published in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease last year said COVID-19-induced lockdowns led to disruptions at 30% of rural community health service points across Africa. Malaria cases started spiking again, breaking a downward trend between 2000 and 2019.\n\nThat downward trend could soon return, according to the WHO.\n\nAfrica is \"at the sharp end of climate change,\" and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events causes havoc in efforts to combat malaria in low- and middle-income regions, Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, warned in December.\n\nIn 2023, the WHO's World Malaria Report included a chapter on the link between malaria and climate change for the first time, highlighting its significance as a potential risk multiplier. Scientists worry that people living in areas once inhospitable to mosquitoes, including the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro and the mountains of eastern Ethiopia, could be exposed.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, which has recorded some of its hottest days in decades, malaria transmission periods have extended in some districts, \"and this shift has been attributed to climate change,\" said Dr. Precious Andifasi, a WHO technical officer for malaria in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

efforts to combat malaria through a joint unit, the president said the Common Management Unit Malaria adopted a comprehensive strategy.\n\n\"Unfortunately, due to the devastating floods in 2022, malaria cases had increased sharply in different parts of the country,\" President Zardari said.\n\nIn his message on the occasion, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasized collaborative efforts to strengthen healthcare systems, increase access to quality diagnosis and treatment, and raise awareness about the importance of prevention and control measures of malaria.\n\n\"The common goal of a world free of malaria can be achieved through vigorous political commitment and adequate investment mix of strategies,\" the premier said.\n\nPM Shehbaz said that the research and academic institutions need to flag scientific advances to both experts and the general public, international partners, companies and foundations to showcase their efforts and reflect on how to further scale up malaria control interventions.\n\nShehbaz Sharif said the Ministry of National Health Services and Coordination through Common Management Unit Malaria, national and international partners, provincial counterparts, NGOs and private stakeholders has significantly enhanced the free malaria testing and treatment facilities in the malaria endemic districts across the country.\n\n\"Despite the country's achievements in Malaria control, sustaining the gains still remains a challenge,\" PM Shehbaz said, adding that everyone must have access to quality assured malaria testing and treatment facilities, free of cost, at their door steps.\n\nThe World Malaria Day is observed every year on April 25 to create awareness and find solutions to the challenges being faced in controlling the disease.",

Malaria is a major public health concern in Nigeria, with an estimated 68 million cases and 194,000 deaths due to the disease in 2021.\n\nThe growing deaths and cases have been linked to the escalating cost of malaria drugs. The Guardian investigation showed that the prices of most malaria drugs have increased by about 150 per cent in the last two years. For instance, Coartem Tab 80/480, which sold for N1,300 in 2022 now sells for N5,000, Lonart DS 80mg/480mg tablet is now N3,000 against N1,200 in 2022, Amatem Soft gel 80/480 is now N2,600 against N1000 it was sold in 2022, Kalther Soft gel 80/480 which was N800 in 2002 now goes for N1500.\n\nOther anti-malaria drugs prices include: Arthequick Tab N900 in 2022, now N1, 500, Lynsunate forte 80/480 N1,500 in 2022 and now sells at N2,200, Coaxin Tab N900 in 2022 now N2,100, Camosunate (Adult) N700 in 2022 and now N2,200, Camosunate (one-six years) N800 in 2022, N1,300 and Clartem DS 80/480 which was N500 in 2022, sells for N950.\n\nExperts confirmed the development and blamed the trend on the worsening economic situation in the country. According to them, the high cost of malaria treatment has pushed Nigerians to unregulated traditional medicine.\n\nA professor of Public Health Parasitology at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State; and Founder Malaria Eradication and Safe Health Initiative of Nigeria, Prof Dennis Aribodor told The Guardian that the rising cost of malaria drugs poses a threat to the nation's malaria control and elimination efforts, saying that a situation where malaria treatment cost over N10,000 portends danger to the fight against malaria.\n\nAribodor warned that the exorbitant cost of antimalarial medicines will worsen the already terrible situation as most Nigerians live under the poverty line. \"What this means is that Nigerians are suffering more burdens associated with malaria. There will be more morbidity and mortality, as well as recycling of poverty among the majority of the population. The economy is already biting hard on most Nigerians, and the exorbitant cost of antimalarial medicines will worsen the situation,\" he said.\n\nAribodor said with many Nigerians resorting to herbal drugs (Agbo) for the treatment of malaria and other ailments; it means that there will be more health problems in the country. \"Many Nigerians including children are already coming down with kidney and liver problems associated with consumption of unregulated herbal medicines. These problems normally end in death. The federal and state governments should declare an emergency in the treatment of malaria. Most hospital visitations are still due to malaria or consequences associated with malaria,\" he said.\n\nHe disclosed that between 2009 to around 2015, Nigeria achieved success in reducing the malaria burden through the support of global partners including UKAID- SuNMaP (Support to National Malaria Programme), World Bank Malaria Assisted Programme, United States President Malaria Initiative, other development partners and organisations.\n\nDuring that period, he said, antimalarial commodities including insecticidal-treated nets, artemisinin-based combination therapy for malaria treatment, intermittent preventive therapy for infants and pregnant women, as well as malaria diagnosis were given almost free to Nigerians.\n\nHe urged the federal and state governments to go back to that experience, to retain gains recorded in the battle against malaria. Aribodor also advocated the social marketing of antimalarial commodities.\n\n\"More importantly, political leaders should summon the political will to address the malaria burden, which has become an embarrassment to the country. If countries like Algeria where Malaria was discovered in 1808, and Cape Verde were able to eliminate malaria from their territories in 2020 and 2023, respectively, then Nigeria has no business being the malaria capital of the world. It is an unenviable record that should be reversed,\" he said.\n\nFor Aribodor, Nigeria should set a deadline for malaria elimination, which can be achieved by the year 2030, if states and Federal Governments muster the political will, mobilise needed resources including funding, human resources and give free malaria services to citizens.\n\nAlso, a pharmacist at the Heeds Pharmacy and Stores Ltd, Lugbe, Abuja, Kosamot Kayode told The Guardian that the present cost of malaria drugs is alarming and unaffordable.\n\nRafiu, who called for urgent government intervention, stated that the high cost of drugs discourages many Nigerians from seeking care in health facilities and makes them resort to traditional medicines for their healthcare needs.\n\nHe said: \"The high exchange rate is affecting the prices of drugs because most of the drugs are imported. The most affected are the anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic drugs, especially the branded drugs. The government needs to intervene so that people will not die. The high cost of drugs has made many people to patronise Agbo, I have never seen any traditional medicine that is effective in the cure of malaria. Most of these people come to the pharmacy after trying the Agbo. If the Agbo had worked, they wouldn't come to the pharmacy.\"\n\nRafiu explained that since the Federal Government banned the use of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies (oAMTs) for malaria treatment due to recurring malaria incidents and resistance, they now use Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of malaria, except for injectables.\n\n\"Currently, malaria is treated with a combination drug and the most common among them is artemether-lumefantrine because the combination enhances the curative treatment of malaria and low resistance and incidence of reoccurrence,\" he added.\n\nBut a journalist, Dele Anofi disagreed with Rafiu. He told The Guardian that he uses Agbo for the treatment of malaria because it is effective and affordable considering that the herbs can be acquired without spending on them.\n\nAnofi, however, explained that the economic situation has nothing to do with his preference for Agbo because to him, orthodox treatment of malaria is equally inexpensive. I have no fears about any negative implications of Agbo for malaria because the herbs involved have been proven not to be harmful. Besides, there's never an overdose or abuse of Agbo in malaria treatment.\n\nA traditional medicine vendor marketing Baba Aisha's product told The Guardian that with N1,200, one can get three wraps of malaria medicine, adding that the herbal mixture can be taken with pap for a complete malaria cure.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) 249 million new cases of malaria and 608, 000 malaria deaths were recorded globally in 2022. The global health body noted that the African Region shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease accounting for 94 per cent and 95 per cent of malaria cases and deaths.\n\nWHO added that in recent years, progress in reducing malaria has ground to a standstill, stressing that not only does malaria continue to directly endanger health and cost lives, it also perpetuates a vicious cycle of inequity.\n\nWith equity in access to malaria services as the focus of the year's World Malaria Day theme, WHO stressed the need to end discrimination and stigma, bring health care close to where people live and work through primary health care and address factors that increase malaria risk including malaria control interventions in universal health coverage.\n\n\"Not only does malaria continue to directly endanger health and cost lives, but it also perpetuates a vicious cycle of inequity. People living in the most vulnerable situations including pregnant women, infants, and children less than five years of age, refugees, migrants, internally displaced people, and indigenous peoples continue to be disproportionately impacted,\" WHO said.\n\nInfants and young children continue to suffer the greatest mortality; in 2022, an estimated 4 out of 5 malaria-related deaths in the African Region were among children under five years of age. Inequities in access to education and financial resources further exacerbate risk: children under five years of age from the poorest households in sub-Saharan Africa are five times more likely to be infected with malaria than those from the wealthiest households.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The disease continues to directly endanger human health and cost lives, not only in the most vulnerable areas, but also in countries with adequate resources.\n\nWorld Malaria Day serves as a reminder of the importance of Malaria prevention and control efforts, particularly for those living in the underdeveloped areas. The day also emphasizes the need for sustained political support and resources for Malaria control and eradication efforts.\n\nFACTS ABOUT MALARIA\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by plasmodium parasite that commonly infects a female anopheles mosquito which feeds on humans.\n\nPeople who get Malaria are typically very sick with symptoms like high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness.\n\nThis usually appear within 10-15 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Some types of malaria can cause severe illness and death.\n\nSevere symptoms include: extreme tiredness and fatigue, impaired consciousness, multiple convulsions, difficulty breathing, dark or bloody urine, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) and abnormal bleeding.\n\nAlthough Malaria can be a deadly disease, illness and death from Malaria can usually be prevented.\n\nRISK GROUPS\n\nThe risk of severe infection is higher in the following groups of people: Babies, children younger than 5 years, pregnant women, travelers, and people with HIV or AIDS.\n\nMALARIA PREVENTION\n\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites or taking medication.\n\n1. Vector control:\n\nWHO currently recommends either the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria control in most malaria-prone areas.\n\n2. Prophylaxis:\n\nTravelers to malaria endemic areas should consult their physician several weeks before departure. The physician will determine which medications are appropriate for the destination country. In some cases, medication must be started 2-3 weeks before departure.\n\n3. Preventive chemotherapies:\n\nIs the use of drugs, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infection and its consequences. It requires the administration of a full course of an antimalarial drug to vulnerable populations at specific times during the period of greatest malaria risk, regardless of whether the recipient is infected with malaria.\n\n4. Vaccine:\n\nBeginning in October 2021, WHO recommends widespread use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission.

Together, under the guidance of FMOH/NMEP, we have made remarkable strides in malaria control and prevention, thanks to the tireless dedication of individuals and organizations across the country.\n\n\"Through robust surveillance, innovative interventions, and strengthened health systems, we have saved countless lives and prevented untold suffering\".\n\nRecognizing Nigerian efforts and the need to sustain and maximize the gains, Mulombo said, \"The government's commitment to turning the tide in the fight against malaria is evident by signing the Yaound\u00e9 Declaration, in March 2024 in which the Government of Nigeria through the Honourable Minister of Health and Social Welfare pledged to accelerate efforts to reduce malaria deaths, the upcoming roundtable meeting next week is also a testimony of commitment to reduce morbidity and mortality due to malaria.\n\n\"This meeting will provide a valuable opportunity for stakeholders to explore innovative strategies and optimize our resources for a better impact. Your participation and contributions will be invaluable as we chart a course towards a malaria-free future for Nigeria.\n\n\"The fight against malaria is not just a health issue; it is a matter of social justice and human rights. By accelerating our efforts to expand access to life-saving interventions, improve health systems, and address the underlying determinants of malaria transmission, we can create a more equitable world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. We also need to bring the communities in the planning and prevention of malaria.\n\n\"Let us change the narrative now and work together to overcome the challenges that stand in the way of malaria elimination. Through collective action, innovation, and unwavering commitment, we can achieve our shared goal of a malaria-free future for all\".\n\nIn her goodwill message, the United States government, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) assured of its commitment to support the country in the efforts to combat the scourge.\n\nUSAID Nigeria Deputy Director, Sara Werth, said gains of the past and ongoing efforts should be maximized for the desired results.\n\nShe said: \"In 2022, Nigeria accounted for 31% of global deaths and 38% of global deaths in children aged under 4 years. Together with our partners, the President's Malaria Initiative, PMI, helped save over 10.6 million lives and prevented 1.7 billion malaria infections worldwide since 2000.\n\n\"In Nigeria, malaria deaths decreased from 194,000 in 2021 to 188,480 in 2022. Prevention of Malaria in Nigeria has contributed to the overall global success of the PMI, program.

But across the African continent malaria has never left, killing or sickening millions of people.\n\nTake Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal neighborhood in Nigeria's Lagos city. Its ponds of dirty water provide favorable breeding conditions for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Kotun can't afford insecticide-treated bed nets that cost between $7 and $21 each, much less antimalarial medications or treatment.\n\nFor World Malaria Day on Thursday, here is what you need to know about the situation in Africa: The malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills. It mostly affects children under 5 and pregnant women. Vaccine efforts are still in early stages: Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine, which is only about 30% effective and doesn't stop transmission. A second vaccine was recently approved. Cases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding by governments and donors for innovation is slowing. Living conditions play a role, with crowded neighborhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials all issues in many areas. And an invasive species of mosquito previously seen mostly in India and the Persian Gulf is a new concern. A GROWING PROBLEM Globally, malaria cases are on the rise. Infections increased from 233 million in 2019 to 249 million in 85 countries in 2022. Malaria deaths rose from 576,000 in 2019 to 608,000 in 2022, according to the World Health Organization. Of the 12 countries that carry about 70% of the global burden of malaria, 11 are in Africa and the other is India. Children under 5 constituted 80% of the 580,000 malaria deaths recorded in Africa in 2022.\n\nCOVID-19 HURT PROGRESS The fight against malaria saw some progress in areas such as rapid diagnostic tests, vaccines and new bed nets meant to counter insecticide resistance, but the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in focus and funding set back efforts. A study published in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease last year said COVID-19-induced lockdowns led to disruptions at 30% of rural community health service points across Africa. Malaria cases started spiking again, breaking a downward trend between 2000 and 2019. That downward trend could soon return, according to the WHO.\n\nA WARMING WORLD AND NEW FRONTIERS Africa is \"at the sharp end of climate change,\" and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events causes havoc in efforts to combat malaria in low- and middle-income regions, Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, warned in December. In 2023, the WHO's World Malaria Report included a chapter on the link between malaria and climate change for the first time, highlighting its significance as a potential risk multiplier. Scientists worry that people living in areas once inhospitable to mosquitoes, including the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro and the mountains of eastern Ethiopia, could be exposed. In Zimbabwe, which has recorded some of its hottest days in decades, malaria transmission periods have extended in some districts, ''and this shift has been attributed to climate change,\" said Dr. Precious Andifasi, a WHO technical officer for malaria in Zimbabwe.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

One common misconception is that malaria solely impacts individuals residing in rural areas and can spread through casual contact. In reality, malaria is a disease that can affect people regardless of their location and is transmitted exclusively through mosquito bites.\n\nAnopheles mosquitoes play a pivotal role in malaria transmission, being the only species capable of transmitting the disease. This dispels the misconception that all mosquitoes carry malaria. In a conversation with Jagran English, Dr. Susanta Kumar Ghosh, formerly with the ICMR-National Institute of Malaria Research in Bangalore and currently the Scientific Advisor at Eco BioTraps, discussed common malaria myths and facts.\n\nMalaria, a disease with a long history of impacting human health, is often surrounded by misconceptions and myths that can hinder efforts to prevent and treat it effectively. From misunderstandings about its transmission to beliefs about immunity and its seriousness, separating fact from fiction is crucial in combating this mosquito-borne illness.\n\nAs per Dr. Susanta, let's delve into some common myths about malaria and uncover the facts behind them to better understand this global health challenge. \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world' is the theme for World Malaria Day 2024. This emphasizes the need for comprehensive engagement of individuals, communities, governments, and civil society for the ultimate endgame for malaria.\n\n1. Myth: Malaria Is Only A Problem In Tropical Regions\n\nFact: While malaria is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, it can also occur in temperate climates. Cases have been reported in places like Europe and North America, although they are less common and often related to travel and migration.\n\n2. Myth: Malaria Is Caused By Being Near Standing Water\n\nFact: While mosquitoes that carry malaria parasites often breed in standing water, simply being near water does not cause malaria. It's the bite of an infected mosquito that transmits the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) to humans.\n\nAlso Read: 6 Key Reasons To Add Yogurt To Your Diet For Clean Skin And Healthy Hair\n\n3. Myth: Malaria Is Caused By A Virus\n\nFact: Malaria is not caused by a virus but by a parasite. The Plasmodium parasite is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. There are several species of Plasmodium, with P. falciparum and P. vivax being the most common and dangerous if not diagnosed and treated in time.\n\nFact: Malaria cannot be treated with antibiotics because it's a parasitic infection, not a bacterial one. Instead, antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), and others are used for treatment, depending on the type and drug resistance patterns.\n\n5. Myth: Malaria Only Affects Humans\n\nFact: While humans are the primary hosts for the malaria parasite, it can infect other animals as well. However, these infections typically do not contribute significantly to the spread of malaria among humans. The fifth human malaria parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi, is basically malaria in monkeys, prevalent in some regions of Southeast Asia, mainly Malaysia.\n\n6. Myth: Once You've Had Malaria, You're Immune For Life\n\nFact: Having malaria once does not guarantee lifelong immunity. Immunity can develop after repeated infections, but it's not absolute and can wane over time, especially if a person moves away from malaria-endemic areas.\n\n7. Myth: All Mosquitoes Transmit Malaria\n\nFact: Only female Anopheles mosquitoes of certain species can transmit malaria. Not all mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite, and even among Anopheles species, not all are vectors for malaria.\n\n8. Myth: Malaria Is Not A Serious Disease\n\nFact: Malaria can be a life-threatening disease, especially if caused by P. falciparum, which can lead to severe complications such as cerebral malaria, multiorgan dysfunction, and death if not treated promptly and effectively.\n\n9. Myth: Malaria Is No Longer A Problem Because Of Modern Medicine\n\nFact: While progress has been made in malaria control and prevention, it still poses a significant health threat in many parts of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Factors like drug resistance, insecticide resistance, lack of access to healthcare, and environmental changes contribute to its persistence.\n\nAlso Read: What Is PGAD, Medical Condition That Left US Woman With Permanent Arousal?\n\n10. Myth: Mosquito Nets Are The Only Effective Way To Prevent Malaria\n\nFact: Mosquito nets, such as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), can prevent mosquito bites and thus malaria transmission, but only on a short-term basis. Long-term elimination strategies based on science, like the use of eco-friendly ovitraps as source reduction and biological control agents, play a crucial role in malaria prevention.\n\nAt last, Dr. Susanta said, Understanding these myths and facts is important for raising awareness about malaria and promoting effective prevention and treatment strategies.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium vivax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium falciparum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antimalarial medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parasitic disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperate climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yogurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/04/25/article/image/mythsandfactsaboitmalaria-1714036200020.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Even with recent significant progress, the fight against malaria still requires a comprehensive strategy that goes beyond awareness to include effective preventive and control measures. Dr. Urman Dhruv, Sr. Consultant Physician, HCG Hospitals, Ahmedabad explains the critical tactics intended to diminish malaria transmission, enhance treatment accessibility, and ultimately attain the lofty aim of eradicating malaria.\n\nSignificant awareness programs play a crucial role in educating communities about the signs, symptoms, and prevention of malaria. Communities may take proactive measures to protect themselves against malaria by raising awareness of the need of using insecticide-treated bed nets, seeking prompt medical assistance for fevers, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites.\n\nEfforts in vector control stand as a cornerstone in combating malaria. Approaches like indoor residual spraying (IRS) and dispensing long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have demonstrated efficacy in curbing malaria transmission. Furthermore, innovative technologies such as genetically modified mosquitoes and larviciding show promise in further reducing mosquito populations and breaking the cycle of malaria transmission.\n\nEfforts in vector control stand as a cornerstone in combating malaria (Image:Freepik)\n\nSwift diagnosis and treatment serve as pivotal factors in lessening malaria-related sickness and fatalities. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) enable healthcare practitioners to promptly diagnose malaria even in remote settings, facilitating timely initiation of treatment. Ensuring access to effective antimalarial medications like artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) is crucial to impede the emergence of drug-resistant strains of malarial parasites.\n\nEstablishing robust health systems is imperative for sustainable efforts in controlling malaria. This encompasses training healthcare personnel in diagnosing and treating malaria, setting up robust surveillance systems to monitor the prevalence of malaria, while guaranteeing the availability of essential medicines and supplies. Strengthening partnerships between public entities, private sectors, alongside civil society groups is crucial for optimizing resource distribution and advocating multi-sectoral approaches to combatting malaria.\n\nCommunity involvement and empowerment play a pivotal role in preventing and managing malaria effectively. By engaging communities in decision-making processes, mobilizing community health workers, coupled with fostering local ownership over initiatives aimed at controlling malarial outbreaks; sustainable progress can be achieved. Empowering communities to take charge of their well-being nurtures a sense of responsibility while promoting the adoption of preventive practices.\n\nTransitioning from raising awareness towards implementing evidence-based interventions necessitates a multifaceted strategy for effective prevention & management against Malaria scourge. By fortifying health systems, bolstering access to diagnosis & treatment services alongside empowering communities; substantial advancements can be made towards alleviating the burden posed by Malaria while striving towards realizing the ambitious vision - eradicating Malaria altogether.

The vaccine rollout, announced on World Malaria Day, seeks to further scale up vaccine deployment in the African region.\n\nToday's launch brings to eight the number of countries on the continent to offer the malaria vaccine as part of the childhood immunization programmes, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Several of the more than 30 countries in the African region that have expressed interest in the vaccine are scheduled to roll it out in the next year through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as efforts continue to widen its deployment in the region in coordination with other prevention measures such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention.\n\nBenin, which received 215 900 doses, has added the malaria vaccine to its Expanded Programme on Immunization. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from around 5 months of age.\n\n\"The introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge. I would like to reassure that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against this serious and fatal diseases,\" said Prof Benjamin Hounkpatin, Minister of Health of Benin.\n\nIn Liberia, the vaccine was launched in the southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterwards in five other counties which have high malaria burden. At least 45 000 children are expected to benefit from the 112 000 doses of the available vaccine.\n\n\"For far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children. But today, with this vaccine and the unwavering commitment of our communities, healthcare workers and our partners, including GAVI, UNICEF and WHO, we break the chain. We have a powerful tool that will protect them from this devastating illness and related deaths, ensuring their right to health and a brighter future. Let's end malaria in Liberia and pave the way for a healthier, more just society,\" said Dr Louise Kpoto, Liberia's Minister of Health.\n\nTwo safe and effective vaccines -- RTS,S and R21 -- recommended by World Health Organization (WHO), are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control. A pilot malaria vaccine programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi reached over 2 million children from 2019 to 2023, showing a significant reduction in malaria illness and a 13% drop in overall child mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550\u202f000 vaccine doses. The vaccine will then be delivered in health facilities nationwide.\n\n\"With the new, safe and efficacious malaria vaccine, we now have an additional tool to fight this disease. In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection,\" said Dr Austin Demby, Minister of Health of Sierra Leone.\n\nMalaria remains a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the World Malaria Report 2023.\n\n\"The African region is advancing in the rollout of the malaria vaccine - a game-changer in our fight against this deadly disease,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \"Working with our member states and partners, we're supporting the ongoing efforts to save the lives of young children and lower the malaria burden in the region.\"\n\nAurelia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, noted: \"Today we celebrate more children gaining access to a new lifesaving tool to fight one of Africa's deadliest diseases. This introduction of malaria vaccines into routine programmes in Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone alongside other proven interventions will help save lives and offer relief to families, communities and hard-pressed health systems.\"\n\nProgress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including climate change, humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge.\n\nTo put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to addressing delays in malaria programme implementation.", "source": {"uri": "afro.who.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHO | Regional Office for Africa"}, "authors":

The vaccine rollout, announced on World Malaria Day, seeks to further scale up vaccine deployment in the African region.\n\nToday's launch brings to eight the number of countries on the continent to offer the malaria vaccine as part of the childhood immunization programmes, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Several of the more than 30 countries in the African region that have expressed interest in the vaccine are scheduled to roll it out in the next year through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as efforts continue to widen its deployment in the region in coordination with other prevention measures such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention.\n\nBenin, which received 215 900 doses, has added the malaria vaccine to its Expanded Programme on Immunization. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from around 5 months of age.\n\n\"The introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge. I would like to reassure that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against this serious and fatal diseases,\" said Prof Benjamin Hounkpatin, Minister of Health of Benin.\n\nIn Liberia, the vaccine was launched in the southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterwards in five other counties which have high malaria burden. At least 45 000 children are expected to benefit from the 112 000 doses of the available vaccine.\n\n\"For far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children.

A pilot malaria vaccine programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi reached over 2 million children from 2019 to 2023, showing a significant reduction in malaria illness and a 13% drop in overall child mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550\u202f000 vaccine doses.

Clear and accurate.", "body": "* \u00a37.4 million funding from UK will make malaria drugs and tests accessible for countries around the world\n\n* Over 50 million people will have access to the life-saving drugs and tests by 2027\n\n* UK-Indian developed vaccines being rolled out to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Benin\n\nBy Duncan Mlanjira\n\nMore than 600,000 people worldwide die every year from preventable and treatable malaria disease and in response to the staggering figures, the United Kingdom (UK) Government will improve access to malaria drugs to help tackle one of the biggest killers of children in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThis has been announced today, April 25 in a statement made available from the British High Commission to Malawi, saying \u00a37.4 million support for MedAccess will be used to negotiate lower prices for vital malaria drugs and diagnostic tests for people in countries affected by the disease.\n\nThe funding brings total UK support to MedAccess to \u00a317.4 million, which will help one million people access new diagnostic tests and 120 million patients to receive anti-malarial treatments.\n\nThe statement further says MedAccess guarantees sales volumes of drugs in markets where demand is uncertain so that manufacturers can commit to affordable prices and stable supply. In return, manufacturers receive assurance that they will be paid even if the demand doesn't materialise.\n\nIn three years, it is expected that more than 50 million people will have access to drugs and other items, continues the statement, adding that this announcement comes on the World Health Organisation (WHO's) World Malaria Day, which aims to keep the disease high on the political agenda, mobilize additional resources, and empower communities.\n\nDeputy Foreign Secretary and Minister for Development and Africa, Andrew Mitchell, is quoted as saying: \"Thanks to British science, we now have life-saving malaria vaccines which will protect millions of people.\n\n\"But we also need to make sure we are making drugs available at the best possible price to the countries that most need them. Deaths from malaria are entirely preventable and the UK's support for MedAccess will ensure that countries can afford to offer people the best protection against the disease.\"\n\nThe statement further says it has also been announced that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Benin will begin their first roll out of the UK-Indian developed RTS,S vaccine, marking a significant milestone in ending malaria.\n\n\"Collaboration between British scientists and Indian manufacturers resulted in two essential malaria vaccines being developed -- RTS,S and R21. These have been used in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, with 2 million children vaccinated since 2019, and, in January, Cameroon became the first country to give the vaccines to children routinely.\n\n\"A total of 22 countries are due to roll out the vaccine. Gavi, which is funded by the UK, is aiming to immunise more than 6 million children from malaria by the end of 2025.\n\n\"UK funding helps MedAccess to reduce the costs of a range of innovative health products for HIV, TB and malaria, meaning that UK support for organisation like Gavi and the Global Fund will go further as they benefit from lower prices for products.\"\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer for MedAccess, Michael Anderson, said: \"We are deeply grateful for FCDO's continued support, which enables MedAccess to improve access to products for HIV, TB, and malaria in support of Global Fund programmes.\n\n\"MedAccess will continue to use innovative financial tools to reduce the cost of diagnosis, prevention and treatment, improving value for money while improving patient access.\n\n\"We are glad to announce this renewed funding on World Malaria Day, an important moment for global stakeholders to come together with a common ambition to accelerate malaria prevention and control.\"\n\nThe World Malaria Day is being commemorated under the theme: 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world' and in its statement, WHO maintains \"recent years, progress in reducing malaria has ground to a standstill\".\n\n\"Not only does malaria continue to directly endanger health and cost lives, but it also perpetuates a vicious cycle of inequity. People living in the most vulnerable situations including pregnant women, infants, children under 5 years of age, refugees, migrants, internally displaced people, and Indigenous Peoples continue to be disproportionately impacted.\n\n\"The WHO African Region shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease - accounting, in 2022, for 94% and 95% of malaria case and deaths.\n\n\"Rural populations in the African region living in situations of poverty and with less access to education are the most impacted. In view of the current trajectory, critical 2025 milestones of the WHO global malaria strategy for reductions in malaria cases and deaths will be missed.\n\n\"Why are pregnant women, young children and other groups in vulnerable situations not accessing the malaria services they need? On World Malaria Day 2024, WHO joins the RBM Partnership to End Malaria and other partners in highlighting barriers to health equity, gender equality and human rights in malaria responses worldwide - as well as concrete measures to overcome them.\"\n\nThe UK is a leading investor in the fight against malaria and is the third largest historical donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, investing \u00a35.5 billion to date.\n\nIts current \u00a31 billion commitment to the Global Fund (2023/24 to 2025/26) will support distributing 86 million mosquito nets, provide 452,000 seasonal malaria chemoprevention treatments and providing malaria treatment and care for 18 million people.\n\nThe UK is the largest sovereign donor to the core immunisation programme of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is currently supporting the roll-out the RTS,S malaria.

Malawi accounts for two percent of malaria cases worldwide and is among the top 15 countries with a high malaria burden.\n\nHowever, each day breeds hope to have malaria eliminated in at least 30 countries by 2030 as per the 2016-2030 global technical strategy for malaria.\n\nRabecca Kapulula, a health surveillance assistant (HSA) at Chileka Health Centre on the outskirts of Lilongwe, is one of the foot soldiers that continue to be vigilant in waging the war against malaria.\n\nKapulula has been plying her trade for 17 years, she notes there is a great deal of progress in stamping out malaria.\n\n\"The introduction of the malaria vaccine is a game changer as we have witnessed a reduction in cases in children. We are getting in the right direction, we are getting there,\" she observes.\n\nIn 2022, Africa was home to 94 percent of malaria cases (233 million) and 95 percent (580 000) of malaria-related deaths.\n\nChildren under five accounted for about 80 percent of all malaria deaths in the region, according to the 2023 World Malaria Report.\n\n\"Apart from getting children aged five years or younger vaccinated, treated nets have been distributed far and wide. We also work with traditional and faith leaders to ensure community members treat the nets and use them accordingly.\n\n\"These compliment other traditional means of eliminating malaria which focus on a multi-pronged approach that includes vector control, prompt access to effective treatment, and preventive measures,\" Kapulula adds.\n\nThree days a week, she uses her push-bike, conquering hills and valleys, to reach out to communities within her 10-kilometer catchment area which comprises a population of about 1,900.\n\nAs the world commemorates World Malaria Day on April 25, Unicef in Malawi celebrates Malawi being among the twelve African countries that received the first ever doses of the malaria vaccine.\n\nThe first consignment arrived in October last year through Kamuzu International Airport.\n\nUnicef's Country Representative in Malawi Shadrack Omol says this allocation is part of a larger effort coordinated by partners and with the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, aimed at prioritising regions with the highest need.\n\n\"Unicef's role in procuring and facilitating the delivery of these vaccines has been instrumental in ensuring that they reach the children most at risk.\n\n\"This vaccine, the first of its kind against a parasitic disease, has already reached over 1.7 million children in pilot programmes across Malawi, Ghana and Kenya since 2019. We applaud Malawi for consistently demonstrating leadership in public health initiatives,\" Omol says.\n\nMalawi records approximately seven million malaria cases annually, contributing significantly to outpatient visits across all age groups.\n\nDespite these challenges, there have been significant strides in malaria control in the country, particularly through the distribution and use of insecticide-treated nets and improvements in case management and malaria prevention programmes.\n\nEfforts continue to increase the uptake of preventative treatments, especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children.\n\nMalawi's National Malaria Strategic Plan 2023-30 aims at eliminating malaria as a public health concern by the year 2030.\n\n\"In pursuit of this goal, the government has laid out comprehensive strategies to increase the proportion of the population protected by at least one malaria vector control intervention from 37 percent in 2022 to at least 90 percent by 2030.\n\n\"These efforts ensure that all suspected cases of malaria are promptly tested and treated, and preventive treatments are readily accessible, especially to our most vulnerable populations,\" the strategic plan reads.\n\nThe National Malaria Communication Strategy 2022-30 also emphasises enhancing social and behavior change, increasing insecticide-treated nets usage, and improving malaria case management and prevention during pregnancy.", "source": {"uri": "times.mw", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times Group Malawi"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

But across the African continent malaria has never left, killing or sickening millions of people.\n\nTake Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal neighbourhood in Nigeria's Lagos city. Its ponds of dirty water provide favourable breeding conditions for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Kotun can't afford insecticide-treated bed nets that cost between USD 7 and USD 21 each, much less antimalarial medications or treatment.\n\nFor World Malaria Day on Thursday, here is what you need to know about the situation in Africa: MALARIA IS STILL WIDESPREAD The malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills. It mostly affects children under 5 and pregnant women. Vaccine efforts are still in early stages: Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine, which is only about 30 per cent effective and doesn't stop transmission. A second vaccine was recently approved. On Thursday, WHO announced that three African countries -- Benin, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- were rolling out vaccine programs for millions of children.\n\nCases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding by governments and donors for innovation is slowing. Living conditions play a role, with crowded neighbourhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials all issues in many areas. And an invasive species of mosquito previously seen mostly in India and the Persian Gulf is a new concern. A GROWING PROBLEM Globally, malaria cases are on the rise. Infections increased from 233 million in 2019 to 249 million in 85 countries in 2022. Malaria deaths rose from 576,000 in 2019 to 608,000 in 2022, according to the World Health Organisation. Of the 12 countries that carry about 70 per cent of the global burden of malaria, 11 are in Africa and the other is India. Children under 5 constituted 80 per cent of the 580,000 malaria deaths recorded in Africa in 2022.\n\nCOVID-19 HURT PROGRESS The fight against malaria saw some progress in areas such as rapid diagnostic tests, vaccines and new bed nets meant to counter insecticide resistance, but the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in focus and funding set back efforts. A study published in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease last year said COVID-19-induced lockdowns led to disruptions at 30 per cent of rural community health service points across Africa. Malaria cases started spiking again, breaking a downward trend between 2000 and 2019. That downward trend could soon return, according to the WHO.\n\nA WARMING WORLD AND NEW FRONTIERS Africa is \"at the sharp end of climate change,\" and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events causes havoc in efforts to combat malaria in low- and middle-income regions, Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, warned in December. In 2023, the WHO's World Malaria Report included a chapter on the link between malaria and climate change for the first time, highlighting its significance as a potential risk multiplier. Scientists worry that people living in areas once inhospitable to mosquitoes, including the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro and the mountains of eastern Ethiopia, could be exposed. In Zimbabwe, which has recorded some of its hottest days in decades, malaria transmission periods have extended in some districts, ''and this shift has been attributed to climate change\", said Dr. Precious Andifasi, a WHO technical officer for malaria in Zimbabwe.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

In Africa, it never left", "body": "LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- When a small number of cases of locally transmitted malaria were found in the United States last year, it was a reminder that climate change is reviving or migrating the threat of some diseases. But across the African continent malaria has never left, killing or sickening millions of people.\n\nTake Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal neighborhood in Nigeria's Lagos city. Its ponds of dirty water provide favorable breeding conditions for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Kotun can't afford insecticide-treated bed nets that cost between $7 and $21 each, much less antimalarial medications or treatment.\n\nFor World Malaria Day on Thursday, here is what you need to know about the situation in Africa:\n\nMALARIA IS STILL WIDESPREAD\n\nThe malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills. It mostly affects children under 5 and pregnant women. Vaccine efforts are still in early stages: Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine, which is only about 30% effective and doesn't stop transmission. A second vaccine was recently approved.\n\nCases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding by governments and donors for innovation is slowing.\n\nLiving conditions play a role, with crowded neighborhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials all issues in many areas. And an invasive species of mosquito previously seen mostly in India and the Persian Gulf is a new concern.\n\nA GROWING PROBLEM\n\nGlobally, malaria cases are on the rise. Infections increased from 233 million in 2019 to 249 million in 85 countries in 2022. Malaria deaths rose from 576,000 in 2019 to 608,000 in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOf the 12 countries that carry about 70% of the global burden of malaria, 11 are in Africa and the other is India. Children under 5 constituted 80% of the 580,000 malaria deaths recorded in Africa in 2022.\n\nCOVID-19 HURT PROGRESS\n\nThe fight against malaria saw some progress in areas such as rapid diagnostic tests, vaccines and new bed nets meant to counter insecticide resistance, but the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in focus and funding set back efforts.\n\nA study published in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease last year said COVID-19-induced lockdowns led to disruptions at 30% of rural community health service points across Africa. Malaria cases started spiking again, breaking a downward trend between 2000 and 2019.\n\nThat downward trend could soon return, according to the WHO.\n\nA WARMING WORLD AND NEW FRONTIERS\n\nAfrica is \"at the sharp end of climate change,\" and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events causes havoc in efforts to combat malaria in low- and middle-income regions, Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, warned in December.\n\nIn 2023, the WHO's World Malaria Report included a chapter on the link between malaria and climate change for the first time, highlighting its significance as a potential risk multiplier. Scientists worry that people living in areas once inhospitable to mosquitoes, including the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro and the mountains of eastern Ethiopia, could be exposed.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, which has recorded some of its hottest days in decades, malaria transmission periods have extended in some districts, \"and this shift has been attributed to climate change,\" said Dr. Precious Andifasi, a WHO technical officer for malaria in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

The vaccine rollout, announced on World Malaria Day, seeks to further scale up vaccine deployment in the African region.\n\nToday's launch brings to eight the number of countries on the continent to offer the malaria vaccine as part of the childhood immunization programmes, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Several of the more than 30 countries in the African region that have expressed interest in the vaccine are scheduled to roll it out in the next year through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as efforts continue to widen its deployment in the region in coordination with other prevention measures such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention.\n\nBenin, which received 215 900 doses, has added the malaria vaccine to its Expanded Programme on Immunization. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from around 5 months of age.\n\n\"The introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge. I would like to reassure that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against this serious and fatal diseases,\" said Prof Benjamin Hounkpatin, Minister of Health of Benin.\n\nIn Liberia, the vaccine was launched in the southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterwards in five other counties which have high malaria burden. At least 45 000 children are expected to benefit from the 112 000 doses of the available vaccine.\n\n\"For far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children. But today, with this vaccine and the unwavering commitment of our communities, healthcare workers and our partners, including Gavi, UNICEF and WHO, we break the chain. We have a powerful tool that will protect them from this devastating illness and related deaths, ensuring their right to health and a brighter future. Let's end malaria in Liberia and pave the way for a healthier, more just society,\" said Dr Louise Kpoto, Liberia's Minister of Health.\n\nTwo safe and effective vaccines -- RTS,S and R21 -- recommended by World Health Organization (WHO), are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control. A pilot malaria vaccine programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi reached over 2 million children from 2019 to 2023, showing a significant reduction in malaria illness and a 13% drop in overall child mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550\u202f000 vaccine doses. The vaccine will then be delivered in health facilities nationwide.\n\n\"With the new, safe and efficacious malaria vaccine, we now have an additional tool to fight this disease. In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection,\" said Dr Austin Demby, Minister of Health of Sierra Leone.\n\nMalaria remains a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the World Malaria Report.\n\n\"The African region is taking positive steps in scaling up the rollout of the malaria vaccine - a game-changer in our fight against this deadly disease,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \"Working with our partners, we're committed to supporting the ongoing efforts to protect, save the lives of young children and lower the malaria burden in the region.\"\n\nAurelia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, noted: \"Today we celebrate more children gaining access to a new lifesaving tool to fight one of Africa's deadliest diseases. This introduction of malaria vaccines into routine programmes in Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone alongside other proven interventions will help save lives and offer relief to families, communities and hard-pressed health systems.\"\n\nProgress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including climate change, humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge.\n\nTo put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to addressing delays in malaria programme implementation.\n\nEight countries have so far rolled out the malaria vaccine as part of childhood immunisation programmes in 2024: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, and Sierra Leone.", "source": {"uri": "politicamentecorretto.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "politicamentecorretto.com"},

In 2022 the West African nation which has a population of about 28 million accounted for 3% of all malaria cases globally, according to the WHO malaria report.\n\nIn a bid to tackle the disease, a team of about 8,300 community health workers equipped with bikes have become key players in reducing malaria mortality among children under five by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier. Early diagnosis also means that children needing more comprehensive care can be referred to public health centres early enough.\n\nEquipped with bikes and medical kits, thousands of community health workers in Cote d'Ivoire are tackling malaria by cycling between remote villages to treat children and educate families, reducing cases by up to 70% in some areas so far this year.\n\nWith progress in reducing malaria grinding to a standstill globally in recent years, the World Health Organization is using World Malaria Day 2024 on April 25 to try to again accelerate the fight against the mosquito-borne disease that kills about half a million children every year.\n\nCommunity health workers like Fran\u00e7ois Kouadio, 46, a father of six himself, are being supported by Save the Children and a group of local partners to make sure families impacted by malaria are reached in a timely way.\n\nHe trained as a community health worker in 2015 and runs blood tests on children to test for malaria and, if positive, treats them with paracetamol and malaria tablets. He also provides care for pregnant women in the village to make sure their risk of getting malaria is minimal.\n\nHaving a community health worker living in the same village allowed Prisca to seek help from Fran\u00e7ois quickly. The early diagnosis and treatment, accompanied by Fran\u00e7ois' daily visit to the family, mean one-year-old Charlene* was saved from malaria and can enjoy playing with her brothers again.\n\nFran\u00e7ois has been able to scale up his work in recent years due to having a bike, visiting up to eight families a day within a five-kilometre radius. He pedals along dirt roads to rural villages where brick houses stand among green forests. He checks if any children are sick, provides appropriate treatment, while raising awareness about malaria and how to prevent it.\n\nFran\u00e7ois's hard work and dedication has won him respect within the community, where people even call him 'doctor'. Every ding from bells on bikes used by Fran\u00e7ois and three other community health workers brings comfort to the people in the villages knowing that healthcare is accessible.\n\n\"I was so scared my daughter might die when she was sick,\" Prisca said. \"(But) my family could see that the medication was working, and we have confident in the treatment. The community health workers are very kind, they give us the tablets for free, and the children recover from their sickness. They do such a great job at bringing comfort to the people in the village.\"\n\nFrancois said from January to March this year, he tested 31 children with fevers, of whom 24 tested positive for malaria and received treatment. This was a massive drop from previous years.\n\n\"In the past, between 20 and 30 children were registered with malaria in a month alone, but with more awareness on malaria, almost everyone now sleeps under a mosquito net and malaria cases have dropped significantly,\" he said.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said people shy away from visiting health centres due to a lack of money, but he is dedicated to caring for children and raising awareness about how to prevent malaria after seeing too many deaths from the disease. He not only encourages people to get appropriate treatment but to also protect themselves by using mosquito nets, keeping houses clean, and covering up water storage containers.\n\nLocal radio stations are also part of Cote d'Ivoire's drive to combat malaria, broadcasting messages about how to treat and prevent the disease. Overall, the aim in Cote d'Ivoire is to reduce malaria incidence and mortality by at least 75% by 2025 compared to 2015.\n\nMalaria is an illness spread by female mosquitoes infected with parasites. If untreated, it can be deadly. In 2022, there were an estimated 249 million cases of malaria worldwide, with children younger than five being the most vulnerable. The infection can also lead to substantial risks during pregnancy.\n\nDr Yssouf Ouattara, Save the Children's Malaria Project Director in Cote D'Ivoire, said:\n\n\"Malaria is preventable and curable, but without access to care it can become deadly - especially for young children.

In 2022 the West African nation which has a population of about 28 million accounted for 3% of all malaria cases globally, according to the WHO malaria report.\n\nIn a bid to tackle the disease, a team of about 8,300 community health workers equipped with bikes have become key players in reducing malaria mortality among children under five by diagnosing and treating the disease earlier. Early diagnosis also means that children needing more comprehensive care can be referred to public health centres early enough.\n\nEquipped with bikes and medical kits, thousands of community health workers in Cote d'Ivoire are tackling malaria by cycling between remote villages to treat children and educate families, reducing cases by up to 70% in some areas so far this year.\n\nWith progress in reducing malaria grinding to a standstill globally in recent years, the World Health Organization is using World Malaria Day 2024 on April 25 to try to again accelerate the fight against the mosquito-borne disease that kills about half a million children every year.\n\nCommunity health workers like Fran\u00e7ois Kouadio, 46, a father of six himself, are being supported by Save the Children and a group of local partners to make sure families impacted by malaria are reached in a timely way.\n\nHe trained as a community health worker in 2015 and runs blood tests on children to test for malaria and, if positive, treats them with paracetamol and malaria tablets. He also provides care for pregnant women in the village to make sure their risk of getting malaria is minimal.\n\nHaving a community health worker living in the same village allowed Prisca to seek help from Fran\u00e7ois quickly. The early diagnosis and treatment, accompanied by Fran\u00e7ois' daily visit to the family, mean one-year-old Charlene* was saved from malaria and can enjoy playing with her brothers again.\n\nFran\u00e7ois has been able to scale up his work in recent years due to having a bike, visiting up to eight families a day within a five-kilometre radius. He pedals along dirt roads to rural villages where brick houses stand among green forests. He checks if any children are sick, provides appropriate treatment, while raising awareness about malaria and how to prevent it.\n\nFran\u00e7ois's hard work and dedication has won him respect within the community, where people even call him 'doctor'. Every ding from bells on bikes used by Fran\u00e7ois and three other community health workers brings comfort to the people in the villages knowing that healthcare is accessible.\n\n\"I was so scared my daughter might die when she was sick,\" Prisca said. \"(But) my family could see that the medication was working, and we have confident in the treatment. The community health workers are very kind, they give us the tablets for free, and the children recover from their sickness. They do such a great job at bringing comfort to the people in the village.\"\n\nFrancois said from January to March this year, he tested 31 children with fevers, of whom 24 tested positive for malaria and received treatment. This was a massive drop from previous years.\n\n\"In the past, between 20 and 30 children were registered with malaria in a month alone, but with more awareness on malaria, almost everyone now sleeps under a mosquito net and malaria cases have dropped significantly,\" he said.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said people shy away from visiting health centres due to a lack of money, but he is dedicated to caring for children and raising awareness about how to prevent malaria after seeing too many deaths from the disease. He not only encourages people to get appropriate treatment but to also protect themselves by using mosquito nets, keeping houses clean, and covering up water storage containers.\n\nLocal radio stations are also part of Cote d'Ivoire's drive to combat malaria, broadcasting messages about how to treat and prevent the disease. Overall, the aim in Cote d'Ivoire is to reduce malaria incidence and mortality by at least 75% by 2025 compared to 2015.\n\nMalaria is an illness spread by female mosquitoes infected with parasites. If untreated, it can be deadly. In 2022, there were an estimated 249 million cases of malaria worldwide, with children younger than five being the most vulnerable. The infection can also lead to substantial risks during pregnancy.\n\nDr Yssouf Ouattara, Save the Children's Malaria Project Director in Cote D'Ivoire, said:\n\n\"Malaria is preventable and curable, but without access to care it can become deadly - especially for young children.

Public healthcare system was in chaos and mayhem during the outbreak of the Coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. Among other life-threatening diseases, malaria remains a significant health concern all over the world. Every year, April 25 brings the global attention to malaria, an 'infection caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.'\n\nThe observance of World Malaria Day 2024 was held with the theme 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world.' The occasion served as an opportunity for the health sector to strengthen their commitment to eradicate malaria completely while also acknowledging the gap in the global malaria eradication/elimination programmes. The Regional Director, World Health Organisation (WHO) South-East Asia Region, in her message on the occasion of World Malaria Day 2024, divulges that in recent years, global efforts to reduce malaria have stagnated, posing a significant threat to public health and exacerbating inequalities within communities. The Regional Director also notes that 'malaria remains a significant public health challenge in our Region, affecting nine out of eleven countries and accounting for a third of the global burden outside Africa.' It supplements the fact provided by the WHO that since 2007, its annual World malaria report on 'a stalling of progress towards critical targets of the global malaria strategy, particularly in countries that carry a high burden of disease.' And therefore, this year the theme, 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world' heightens the need 'for renewed attention to the barriers to health equity, gender equality, and human rights in malaria responses.'\n\nBack here in Nagaland, according to data from the National Center for Vector Borne Disease Control (NCVBDC), Directorate of Health & Family Welfare (DoHFW) the districts of Dimapur, Phek, Longleng, Mokokchung, Tuensang, Mon, Kiphire and Zunheboto have reported zero case in 2023. 'The trend data shows a steady reduction in malaria cases over the past six years from 20 cases in 2019 to zero case in 2024. There were 12 positive cases reported in 2020, eight in 2021, five in 2022 and four in 2023' reports, the journalist from this newspaper covering the observation of the World Malaria Day in Kohima. With is achievement, Nagaland is reportedly one of the best performing states in the Northeast region towards elimination of malaria. It is encouraging and important to note the observation made that Nagaland has made significant achievement towards the elimination of malaria by 2030. And the accomplishment made has been attributed to the diligent health workers and community volunteers, particularly Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA). This is another positive example of community engagement for attaining a targeted goal. Nagaland is home to indigenous people and very much a community-based society, and this unquestionably would aid in facilitating diseases elimination efforts. Implementing effective community engagement could perhaps make it easier to commit to accelerating the fight against malaria.", "source": {"uri": "morungexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Severe malaria cases similarly declined from 18,000 in 2017 to 1,300 in 2023, with malaria-related fatalities dropping from approximately 600 in 2017 to 51 in 2023, according to Aimable Mbituyumuremyi, an official from the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC).\n\nData from the RBC also revealed a significant decrease in malaria prevalence, with only 47 cases per 1,000 people in 2023, down from 409 per 1,000 people in 2017. Rwanda has set an ambitious target to eliminate malaria by 2030.\n\nMbituyumuremyi credited this remarkable progress to the implementation of malaria response interventions, including the use of digital and innovative tools, as well as robust community engagement.\n\nIn 2020, Rwanda introduced the use of drone technology for larvicide spraying in swamps, complementing indoor residual spraying to target mosquitoes at their breeding grounds.

Additionally, mosquito bed nets are distributed to vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and children, nationwide.\n\nGlobally, in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 malaria deaths in 85 countries, according to the World Health Organization.

Many times, what people call resistance to malaria is not resistance but because of some other pathogens that the individuals are also infected with which could be viruses or bacteria. For that reason, it is now very important for people to start looking in the direction of co-infections, which is very common. These other pathogens have other symptoms like that of malaria, so these are big issues that must be addressed.\n\n\"This means that in treating malaria, we have to be very cautious because we have to ascertain that what you have is malaria infection and not just something else.\n\n\"Sometimes, we treat malaria when it is not malaria and sometimes we treat malaria alone leaving the other co-infecting pathogen.\"\n\nThe don gave kudos to the WHO and other researchers whose interventions had helped reduce malaria deaths in the country.\n\nHe, however, emphasised the need for scaling up the progress made over the years by ensuring appropriate diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of malaria cases.\n\nAdemowo further noted, \"One of the things that escalate resistance to malaria or even other pathogens is when people don't comply with the usage of their drugs. Someone who is supposed to take a drug for three days takes it for one or two days because they have had relief from the symptoms. This is very common and studies have shown that people don't complete the usage of their drugs and treatment for malaria is not an exemption.\"\n\nThe don advocated a comprehensive approach to preventing malaria infection, emphasising the need to eliminate contact between mosquitoes and humans, which are the vectors for the disease.\n\n\"If you have a fever that is not going, ensure that you carry out appropriate tests to confirm that it is malaria or not before you start blaming it on malaria alone. A persisting fever that is being treated as malaria whereas it is not malaria means that the causative agent would continue to ravage and damage the person's body,\" the pharmacist stated.\n\nAdemowo called for government intervention in the rising prices of malaria treatment, recommending subsidised prices for children and pregnant women.\n\nOn his part, a professor of Pharmacology and Therapeutics at the Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Maiduguri, Borno State, Sulayman Balogun, noted that recurrence and anti-malaria resistance are two challenges the country is facing when it comes to malaria.\n\nHe said that the recurrence of malaria is primarily attributed to frequent exposure to the disease vector and that resistance to anti-malaria drugs occur when malaria symptoms persist despite treatment.\n\nHe added that environmental factors and human behaviour further contributed to these factors.\n\nBalogun said, \"Virtually all known anti-malaria drugs, malaria has developed resistance to it and that was led to the ACT that Nigeria adopted in 2005. The parasite, plasmodium feeds on blood cells to survive but because it wants to protect itself from danger, it mutates genetically such that the drug introduced will no longer work and (the parasite) continues to multiply in the blood cells of its host. That way, we say resistance has developed.\"\n\nThe pharmacist refuted the notion that all fevers are malaria, calling for laboratory diagnosis before the diagnosis and treatment of malaria were done.\n\nHe also said that the non-compliance with treatment regimen and substandard drugs contributes to anti-malaria resistance.\n\nThe researcher said, \"We assume all fever is malaria, whether we do a diagnosis or not and a lot of irrational use of anti-malaria drugs will promote resistance.\n\n\"Again, non-compliance with treatment is done a lot. We go to the doctor and an anti-malaria drug is prescribed for three days and after taking the first two doses the first day and feeling relieved, we discontinue usage and this will promote and predispose the parasite to drug resistance.\"\n\nTo curb anti-malaria resistance, Balogun emphasised the need for laboratory testing before the commencement of malaria treatment to ensure the right diagnosis and drug administration.\n\nHe further encouraged the adoption of preventive measures, including sleeping under insecticide-treated nets, using insecticide sprays, and installing nets on windows and doors to deter mosquitoes.\n\nHe advised against staying in dark areas prone to mosquito infestation at night time.\n\nBalogun also mentioned that the government had introduced preventive drugs for pregnant women, children under the age of five, and individuals living with sickle cell disease during malaria outbreaks.", "source": {"uri": "healthwise.punchng.com", "dataType": "news",

(Image Credits: Pixabay)\n\nWorld Malaria Day 2024: Malaria is a serious disease that occurs when a person get bitten by mosquito. When a mosquito bites, it injects malaria parasites into your bloodstream.\n\nIf left untreated, malaria can lead to serious complications like seizures, brain damage, trouble breathing, organ failure and even death. Every year, April 25 is marked as the World Malaria Day to raise awareness the about the vector-borne disease and its impact.\n\nMalaria occurs all over the world and happens most often in developing countries and areas with warm temperatures and high humidity.\n\nWorld Malaria Day 2024: What are the causes?\n\nMalaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. This parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites. According to Cleveland Clinic, when an infected mosquito bites someone, it transfers the parasite to the person's bloodstream and then the parasites multiply. There are five types of malaria parasites that can infect humans. In some rare cases, people who are pregnant and who have malaria can transfer the disease to their children before or during birth.\n\nAs malaria gets worse, it can cause anemia and jaundice. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the most severe form of malaria, which may progress to a coma, is known as cerebral malaria. This type represents about 15 percent of deaths in children and nearly 20 percent of adult deaths. It is noteworthy that malaria symptoms usually appear 10 days to one month after the person was infected.\n\nWorld Malaria Day 2024: What are the precautions that you should take?", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "health_desk@financialexpress.com", "name": "Health Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_damage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain damage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaundice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coma"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mosquito-49141_1280-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 475}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

However, the number of British travellers catching malaria abroad is rising, and scientists are warning it could get worse.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has just published its latest data on malaria in travellers returning to the UK, and the numbers are troubling. Over 2,000 cases were reported in 2023, the highest total in over two decades.\n\nAlthough the increase partly reflects a return to \"normal\" volumes of people travelling, there are more alarming factors at play. Globally, the number of cases of malaria has risen by 16 million, compared with pre-pandemic levels.\n\nNo less worrying is the potential impact of climate change. Warmer temperatures can extend malaria transmission season, as well as extend the disease's geographical range to higher altitudes and cooler places where transmission was previously uncommon. Flooding and extreme weather events create perfect conditions for mosquitoes to thrive, resulting in outbreaks of the disease.\n\nIn tropical countries where malaria is widely prevalent, the disease takes a huge toll. In 2022, there were 249 million cases, 94 per cent of which were in Africa. These led to at least 608,000 deaths, mostly in children.\n\nBut research recently presented at the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Global Congress in Spain suggested that if the world's carbon emissions and population growth remain on the current trajectory, the populations at risk of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases could increase by an additional 4.7 billion people by 2100, relative to 1970-1999.\n\nMosquitoes are versatile and able to change their habits and biting behaviour in response to efforts to control them, therefore presenting a complex health challenge. In fact, the United States recently saw its first cases of local malaria transmission for 20 years, an important warning of what may lie ahead.\n\nSo, as risks for this deadly disease rise, here is what travellers need to know to stay safe abroad.\n\nWhat is malaria?\n\nMalaria is an infection caused by a tiny, blood-borne parasite, transmitted by the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms can often be delayed until some time after exposure (a minimum of seven days but often four weeks or much longer), meaning the connection with travel may be forgotten, delaying diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosing malaria depends on knowing that a person has been in a destination with a risk of the disease, since early symptoms can be non-specific, and malaria has a remarkable ability to be mistaken for other conditions.\n\nThe most common symptoms of malaria are: fever, usually above 38C and often intermittent; fatigue; aching muscles and joints; headache; chills (often with sweating and shivering); abdominal pains and diarrhoea; sometimes jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of eyes). Severe malaria can result in headache, fits and even death. Suspected malaria is therefore a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is effective and life-saving.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you develop a fever or become unwell on return home from travelling abroad, seek medical advice promptly and make sure your doctor knows that you have been away.\n\nWhat areas have risks of malaria?\n\nRisk areas for malaria include many parts of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Oceania - including holiday destinations in parts of Thailand, India and Peru.\n\nHow to prevent malaria on your travelsMedical prevention\n\nFour to six weeks before your holiday begins, seek advice from a travel clinic regarding antimalarial medications - a doctor can advise on where and whether they are needed, and the options likely to suit you best.\n\nMalarone and doxycycline are the two most-commonly prescribed medications, usually tablets or capsules taken once a day. They need to be commenced before travel, taken while you are away and continued on your return home.\n\nFor now, there are no suitable malaria vaccines for travellers. However, promisingly, two important vaccines have recently become available to combat malaria as part of public health campaigns in parts of Africa.\n\nAvoiding insects\n\nBite prevention measures dramatically reduce the risk of disease, with insect repellents containing DEET, plug-in insect killers, mosquito bed nets and a wide range of other options.\n\nOther mosquito-borne diseases\n\nMalaria is not the only disease on the rise due to climate change. Other mosquito-borne diseases include dengue fever (currently causing a large outbreak in South America), Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika. The Zika outbreak in 2016 demonstrated how quickly mosquito-borne diseases can turn into an international health emergency. Climate change is expanding the range of mosquitoes capable of spreading them, and constant vigilance will be needed to combat them.\n\nFind up more travel health information at fitfortravel.nhs.uk and travelhealthpro.org.uk.\n\nDr Richard Dawood is a specialist in Travel Medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic.

Empowering individuals with knowledge about the disease, its transmission, and preventive measures empowers communities to take proactive steps in protecting themselves. Health education campaigns, delivered through various channels including schools, healthcare facilities, and community gatherings, raise awareness and promote behavior change.\n\nMalaria, a deadly disease transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its impact extends beyond the immediate health consequences, affecting economies, education, and overall development. To combat malaria effectively, it's crucial to raise awareness about the disease, strategies for its control, and the ultimate goal of complete eradication.\n\nFirstly, understanding the basics of malaria transmission is essential. The disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites, with five species known to infect humans. These parasites are transmitted through the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes, which thrive in warm and humid climates. Recognizing the symptoms of malaria, such as fever, chills, headache, and nausea, is vital for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\nPreventive measures play a pivotal role in controlling malaria. The widespread use of insecticide-treated bed nets, particularly long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), has proven to be effective in reducing mosquito bites during sleep, a common time for transmission. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides further diminishes mosquito populations, contributing to malaria prevention efforts.\n\nMoreover, access to appropriate healthcare services is critical for early diagnosis and treatment. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) enable quick identification of malaria infection, facilitating timely administration of antimalarial medications. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the frontline treatment for uncomplicated malaria, ensuring effective parasite clearance and reducing the risk of drug resistance.\n\nCommunity engagement and education are fundamental components of malaria control programs. Empowering individuals with knowledge about the disease, its transmission, and preventive measures empowers communities to take proactive steps in protecting themselves. Health education campaigns, delivered through various channels including schools, healthcare facilities, and community gatherings, raise awareness and promote behavior change.\n\nHowever, achieving malaria eradication requires sustained efforts and collaboration on a global scale. Investments in research and development are essential for the development of new tools and strategies, including vaccines, novel insecticides, and improved diagnostics. Additionally, strengthening health systems, particularly in resource-limited settings, enhances the delivery of malaria interventions and ensures equitable access to healthcare services.\n\nAddressing the environmental and socio-economic determinants of malaria is crucial for long-term success. Factors such as stagnant water bodies, deforestation, and inadequate housing contribute to mosquito breeding sites and increase the risk of malaria transmission. Socio-economic disparities, including poverty and lack of access to education and healthcare, exacerbate vulnerability to the disease.\n\nMalaria symptoms vary but commonly include fever, chills, sweats, headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Prevention measures like mosquito nets, insect repellents, and antimalarial medication are essential, particularly in malaria-endemic regions. Seeking medical care upon experiencing symptoms is imperative.\n\nRaising awareness about malaria, its prevention, and treatment is paramount in the global effort to control and ultimately eradicate the disease.\n\nThrough a comprehensive approach that integrates preventive measures, prompt diagnosis, effective treatment, and community engagement, we can significantly reduce the burden of malaria and move closer to achieving the goal of a malaria-free world. It is imperative that governments, international organizations, civil society, and individuals join forces in this endeavor, ensuring that no one is left behind in the fight against malaria.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hans India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_india@thehansindia.com", "name": "Hans India", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_change_(public_health)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behavior change (public health)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antimalarial medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indoor residual spraying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.thehansindia.com/h-upload/2024/04/25/1441875-health.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The vaccine rollout, announced on World Malaria Day, seeks to further scale up vaccine deployment in the African region.Today's launch brings to eight the number of countries on the continent to offer the malaria vaccine as part of the childhood immunization programmes, extending access to more comprehensive malaria prevention. Several of the more than 30 countries in the African region that have expressed interest in the vaccine are scheduled to roll it out in the next year through support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as efforts continue to widen its deployment in the region in coordination with other prevention measures such as long-lasting insecticidal nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention.\n\nBenin, which received 215,900 doses, has added the malaria vaccine to its Expanded Programme on Immunization. The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from around 5 months of age.\n\n\"The introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunization for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge. I would like to reassure that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against this serious and fatal diseases,\" said Prof Benjamin Hounkpatin, Minister of Health of Benin.\n\nIn Liberia, the vaccine was launched in the southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterwards in five other counties which have high malaria burden. At least 45,000 children are expected to benefit from the 112,000 doses of the available vaccine.\n\n\"For far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children. But today, with this vaccine and the unwavering commitment of our communities, healthcare workers and our partners, including Gavi, UNICEF and WHO, we break the chain. We have a powerful tool that will protect them from this devastating illness and related deaths, ensuring their right to health and a brighter future. Let's end malaria in Liberia and pave the way for a healthier, more just society,\" said Dr Louise Kpoto, Liberia's Minister of Health.\n\nTwo safe and effective vaccines - RTS,S and R21 - recommended by World Health Organization (WHO), are a breakthrough for child health and malaria control. A pilot malaria vaccine programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi reached over 2 million children from 2019 to 2023, showing a significant reduction in malaria illness and a 13% drop in overall child mortality and substantial reductions in hospitalizations.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550,000 vaccine doses. The vaccine will then be delivered in health facilities nationwide.\n\n\"With the new, safe and efficacious malaria vaccine, we now have an additional tool to fight this disease. In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection,\" said Dr Austin Demby, Minister of Health of Sierra Leone.\n\nMalaria remains a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria. The region accounted for 94% of global malaria cases and 95% of all malaria deaths in 2022, according to the World Malaria Report.\n\n\"The African region is taking positive steps in scaling up the rollout of the malaria vaccine - a game-changer in our fight against this deadly disease,\" said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \"Working with our partners, we're committed to supporting the ongoing efforts to protect, save the lives of young children and lower the malaria burden in the region.\"\n\nAur\u00e9lia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, noted: \"Today we celebrate more children gaining access to a new life-saving tool to fight one of Africa's deadliest diseases. This introduction of malaria vaccines into routine programmes in Benin, Liberia, and Sierra Leone alongside other proven interventions will help save lives and offer relief to families, communities and hard-pressed health systems.\"\n\nProgress against malaria has stalled in these high-burden African countries since 2017 due to factors including climate change, humanitarian crises, low access to and insufficient quality of health services, gender-related barriers, biological threats such as insecticide and drug resistance and global economic crises. Fragile health systems and critical gaps in data and surveillance have compounded the challenge.\n\nTo put malaria progress back on track, WHO recommends robust commitment to malaria responses at all levels, particularly in high-burden countries; greater domestic and international funding; science and data-driven malaria responses; urgent action on the health impacts of climate change; harnessing research and innovation; as well as strong partnerships for coordinated responses. WHO is also calling attention to addressing delays in malaria programme implementation.\n\nNotes to editors\n\nEight countries have so far rolled out the malaria vaccine as part of childhood immunization programmes in 2024: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, and Sierra Leone.\n\nAbout Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance\n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance is a public-private partnership that helps vaccinate more than half the world's children against some of the world's deadliest diseases. The Vaccine Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, the vaccine industry, technical agencies, civil society, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other private sector partners. View the full list of donor governments and other leading organisations that fund Gavi's work here.\n\nSince its inception in 2000, Gavi has helped to immunise a whole generation - over 1 billion children - and prevented more than 17.3 million future deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 78 lower-income countries.

Before the establishment of World Malaria Day, Africa Malaria Day was held on April 25. Africa Malaria Day began in 2001, one year after the historic Abuja Declaration was signed by 44 malaria-endemic countries at the African Summit on Malaria.

Now there are two against malaria: the RTS,S and the R21 vaccines.\n\nAdrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and chief investigator for the R21 vaccine, tells Nadine Dreyer why he thinks this is a great era for malaria control.\n\nWhat makes malaria such a difficult disease to beat?\n\nMalaria has been around for 30 million years. Human beings have not.\n\nOur hominoid predecessors were being infected by malaria parasites tens of millions of years ago, so these parasites had a lot of practice at clever tricks to escape immune systems long before we came along. Homo sapiens first evolved in Africa about 315,000 years ago.\n\nMalaria is not a virus and nor is it a bacterium. It's a protozoan parasite, thousands of times larger than a typical virus. A good comparison is how many genes it has. COVID-19 has about a dozen, malaria has about 5,000.\n\nAdditionally, the malaria parasite goes through four life cycle stages. This is as complex as it gets with infectious pathogens.\n\nMedical researchers have been trying to make malaria vaccines for over 100 years. In Oxford it's taken us 30 years of research.\n\nHow does the R21/Matrix-M vaccine work?\n\nThe four malaria life cycles are all hugely different, with different antigens expressed. An antigen is any substance that causes the body to make an immune response against that substance.\n\nWe targeted the sporozoites, which is the form that the mosquito inoculates into your skin. We were working to trap them before they could get to the liver and then carry on their life cycle by multiplying furiously.\n\nEach mosquito injects a small number of sporozoites, perhaps 20, into the skin. If you clear those 20, you've won. If one gets through, you've lost. The bad news is you've only got minutes.\n\nSo you need extraordinarily high levels of antibodies that the parasite hasn't seen before and hasn't learnt to evolve against. Technologically it's like having to design a car that's 10 times faster than anything else on the road.\n\nLuckily, there are no symptoms of malaria at that stage.\n\nRead more: Two new malaria vaccines are being rolled out across Africa: how they work and what they promise\n\nA child dies every minute from malaria in Africa. Why are children more susceptible than adults?\n\nChildren under five years old account for about 80% of all malaria deaths in Africa. The age you're most likely to die of malaria in Africa is when you are one year old.\n\nFor the first six months you are protected largely by your mother's immunity and the antibodies she transfers during pregnancy.\n\nIf you survive to age two or three, and you've had a few episodes of malaria and you are still alive, you've got a bit of immunity. This improves over time.\n\nSome children get up to eight episodes in three or four months. They get quite unwell with the first, and three weeks later they're having a second bout and so on.\n\nNatural immunity doesn't work until you've had a lot of different infections and that's why adults are generally protected against malaria and don't become very unwell.\n\nWithout malaria, children would be healthier in general -- the disease makes you susceptible to other infections.\n\nWhat about the pace of vaccine rollouts?\n\nWe've been disappointed that it's taken more than six months to roll out the R21 vaccine since it was approved in October last year. There are millions of doses of R21 sitting in a fridge in India.\n\nThere are a lot of organisations and processes involved in standard deployment that don't seem necessary.\n\nCompare that to a COVID-19 vaccine from Oxford and AstraZeneca that was approved on New Year's Eve 2020 and rolled out in several countries the very next week.\n\nIn the same year malaria killed more people in Africa than COVID-19 did.\n\nThe first malaria vaccine, the RTS,S, has already been given to millions of children in a large safety trial and the uptake has been really high, so large coverage can be achieved in Africa.\n\nHow big a role will vaccines have in the fight to eradicate malaria?\n\nWe really think we have an opportunity now to make a big impact.\n\nNobody is quite sure how many of the older tools such as insecticides and bed nets we need to carry on with. The advice is to keep them all.\n\nBut mosquitoes are building resistance to insecticides. Anti-malaria medication only lasts for days and parasites are building up resistance against these drugs as well.\n\nThere are about 40 million children born every year in malaria areas in Africa who would benefit from a vaccine. The R21/Matrix-M has been designed to be manufactured at scale. The Serum Institute of India, our manufacturing and commercial partner, can produce hundreds of millions of doses each year.\n\nAnother real advantage is its low cost. At US$3.90 a dose the R21/Matrix-M appears to be the most effective single intervention we can deploy against malaria\n\nWorldwide there is US$5 billion currently allocated to fight malaria each year.\n\nWe're optimistic that if this money is spent sensibly we can make a big difference. Buying 200 million doses of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine would cost US$800 million.\n\nBeing in the field I'm aware of other vaccines coming along. Some are targeting the blood stage and others the mosquito stage of malaria, which is very exciting. This looks like a great era for malaria control.\n\nMore than 600,000 people die of malaria each year. With low-cost, very effective vaccines being deployed we should be able to get this down to 200,000 or less by the end of this decade.\n\nThen the endgame will be malaria eradication worldwide, which really should happen in the 2030s.", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenner_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jenner Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS,S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RTS,S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protozoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitic disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_Institute_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serum Institute of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AstraZeneca"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Representative image. Pexels\n\nA word of caution. Do not take malaria lightly. It continues to be one of the top life-threatening diseases. There were an estimated 249 million cases of malaria around the world in 2022 with over 600,000 deaths, the World Health Organisation reported.\n\nMany low and middle-income countries still struggle to put a leash on the deadly disease. It was thought to have been eliminated in higher-income countries like the US and nations in Europe. But now is making its way back. The reason? Climate change, say experts.\n\nThis World Malaria Day, let's take a closer look at how this disease spreads and exactly how climate change is set to worsen it.\n\nHow does malaria spread?\n\nAs per the WHO, the mosquito-borne disease is transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The person experiences high fever, nausea, body aches and shaking chills.\n\nThough malaria is treatable, it can cause kidney failure, seizures, mental confusion, coma, and even death in severe cases if not diagnosed and treated in time, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said.\n\nThe mosquitos that carry the parasite majorly thrive in hot and humid climatic conditions, such as in tropical countries of Asia and Africa where crowded neighbourhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials are contributing factors.\n\nNotably, Dr Daniel Ngamije, who directs the WHO malaria programme, said that cases in 2022 were concentrated in just five countries: Pakistan, Nigeria, Uganda, Ethiopia and Papua-New Guinea, with climate change being a direct contributor in three of them.\n\nWhat does the picture in Asia look like?\n\nAs per a World Bank report, South Asia, including eight countries like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, is the most vulnerable region to climate shocks, and extreme weather events and is experiencing a \"new climate normal\".\n\nPakistan, for example, battled catastrophic flooding in 2022 during which more than a third of the country was underwater and 33 million people were affected. As the water receded, it saw a five-fold increase in malaria cases, with as many as 2.6 million cases as compared to 500,000 a year ago, according to WHO data.\n\n\"It was just the perfect storm for malaria,\" Dr Schapira, a WHO consultant who reviewed Pakistan's national malaria programme, said.\n\nIncreasing variations in climate and decreasing insecticide and drug resistance are also expected to increase the suitability for malaria transmission in the northeastern regions of India such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Pondicherry, Dr Andrew Karanja Githeko, a climate expert wrote in a paper titled \"Malaria and climate change\".\n\n\"The changing climate poses a substantial risk to progress against malaria, particularly in vulnerable regions. Sustainable and resilient malaria responses are needed now more than ever, coupled with urgent actions to slow the pace of global warming and reduce its effects,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.\n\nHow common are outbreaks in Europe and the US?\n\nMalaria is no longer an anomaly in the West. As global temperatures soar, breaking records each year, mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue are making their presence across the world, an expert was quoted as saying by The Guardian report.\n\nRachel Lowe, who leads the global health resilience group at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain, has cautioned that outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases are poised to spread across currently unaffected parts of northern Europe, Asia, North America, and Australia over the next few decades.\n\n\"Global warming resulting from climate change means that the disease vectors carrying and spreading malaria and dengue fever can inhabit more regions, leading to outbreaks in areas where people are likely to lack immunity and where public health systems are unprepared,\" Lowe told the publication.\n\nThe Asian tiger mosquito, which carries dengue fever, has become established in 13 European countries, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. As of 2023, it was present in Italy, France, Spain, Malta, Monaco, San Marino, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Greece, and Portugal.\n\nThe US is also seeing a rise in cases.\n\nAccording to John Hopkins University, the US reported the first homegrown malaria cases in 20 years last year. Usually each year, 2,000-2,500 malaria cases related to travel to Sub-Sahara or Southeast Asia regions where the disease is prevalent are reported.\n\nHowever, in 2023, nine locally transmitted cases were contracted by individuals who hadn't recently visited those areas raising concerns over the re-emergence or emergence of mosquito-borne diseases in new places.\n\nNow we are in 2024. Science continues to make great advances. But to fight malaria, we might need more than just medical breakthroughs. We need a healthier planet.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sayli_dhodapkar@firstpost.com", "name": "Sayli Dhodapkar", "type":

Reuters\n\nIn Joseph Conrad's 1899 novel, Heart of Darkness, the oppressive atmosphere of the Congo, teeming with disease, is a potent metaphor for the darkness within humanity. Conrad captures the constant threat of malaria by describing the environment where mosquitoes swarm ominously, spreading the deadly disease. He writes, \"The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there -- it could crawl and at you with the veritable aspect of the devil&mldr; You wondered whether you had come to the wrong planet. What made this wild heartbeat, what made this wild lung breathe?\"\n\nThough written over a century ago, Conrad's portrayal of malaria is strikingly relevant today. In 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases globally, which led to the death of 608,000 individuals.\n\nDespite decades of global efforts to eradicate malaria -- starting with the Global Malaria Eradication Programme in 1955 and revitalised by the Sustainable Development Goals -- the progress has been painfully slow. Malaria mortality rates have decreased since 2000, but the pace is insufficient. The current trajectory suggests we are 400 years behind schedule.\n\nMore alarmingly, malaria still disproportionately affects the youngest, with a staggering 76 per cent of malaria deaths in 2022 occurring in children under five. According to recent estimations by the UN Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimations, the impact of malaria on young lives is devastatingly clear: nearly every minute, a child under the age of five succumbs to this preventable disease. The world's commitment to end malaria by 2030 is far from being on track.\n\nThe global distribution of malaria showcases stark regional disparities, with the burden predominantly falling on developing countries. In 2022, there were 249 million malaria cases across 85 endemic countries. Notably, the WHO African Region alone accounted for about 94 per cent of these cases, with four countries -- Nigeria (27 per cent), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12 per cent), Uganda (5 per cent), and Mozambique (4 per cent) -- bearing nearly half of the global caseload. While malaria deaths have decreased from 864,000 in 2000 to 608,000 in 2022, nearly 96 per cent of these deaths occurred in just 29 countries. In 2022, countries such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, and the United Republic of Tanzania accounted for over half of all global malaria fatalities.\n\nMalaria's deadliness in Africa compared to other regions like India can be attributed to several factors. First, malaria transmission is significantly heightened in Africa by the presence of the continent's most efficient vectors, i.e., Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus. These mosquito species are particularly adept at spreading the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, the most lethal and prevalent parasite on the continent.\n\nSecond, the situation is exacerbated by the emerging resistance to treatments. Over the years, Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance to several antimalarial drugs, including chloroquine and, more recently, artemisinins. Third, routine surveillance systems must often be developed in Africa to monitor resistance patterns and guide treatment protocols. This delays detecting and responding to resistance, allowing it to spread unchecked.\n\nWhile India has achieved a significant reduction in malaria cases, the disease continues to pose a health concern. According to the WHO South-East Asia Region's 2022 report, this region accounted for 5.2 million malaria cases, representing 2 per cent of the global burden, with India responsible for approximately 65.7 per cent of these cases. Nearly 46 per cent of the cases in India were caused by P. vivax. India also achieved an 85.1 per cent decline in malaria cases and an 83.36 per cent reduction in malaria-related deaths from 2015 to 2022, positioning it as the only high-burden, high-impact country in Southeast Asia to report a case decline in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nThis has been possible because GoI has implemented strategic initiatives such as the National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME) 2016-2030, aiming to eradicate malaria by 2030, and provides budgetary support for the prevention, control, and elimination of vector-borne diseases. However, the per capita incidence of malaria remains high in several states, including Mizoram, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Meghalaya.\n\nFor regions with high malaria incidence (globally), core interventions such as the deployment of Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs), specifically Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs), are critical. ITNs have proven effective in reducing individual exposure to mosquito bites and achieving a 'community effect,' where the presence of ITNs reduces the overall mosquito population and longevity, thus diminishing the vectorial capacity for malaria transmission.\n\nEnsuring people sleep under an ITN is one of the most cost-effective methods to prevent malaria -- costing less than $4 per net and leading to a significant reduction in transmission by ensuring mosquitoes die before the parasites can mature and spread. According to an analysis done by Copenhagen Consensus, this strategy, despite the $1.1 billion annual cost (globally) to address malaria resistance, yields a return of $48 for every dollar invested, underscoring the importance of systematic distribution and education to achieve at least 50 per cent coverage for significant community-wide protection.\n\nAdditionally, where pyrethroid resistance, the common insecticide on ITNs, is confirmed, the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets, which combine pyrethroid with piperonyl butoxide to counteract resistance, should be considered.\n\nFinally, in regions where vector control strategies like Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) are applicable, they should be integrated with ITN strategies for a more robust approach. IRS involves applying long-lasting insecticides to the surfaces of dwellings, killing mosquitoes that come into contact with these treated surfaces. Local vector resistance patterns should inform the choice of insecticide, and IRS should be strategically timed to precede peak transmission seasons to maximize its impact. This should be coupled with behavioural interventions to nudge people to use ITNs.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This year's theme is \"accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,\" as many people globally have no access to quality, timely treatment, and affordable services to prevent, detect, and treat malaria.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022, malaria claimed the lives of an estimated 608, 000 people worldwide and there were 249 million new cases.\n\nA 2022 Lancet study on malaria showed that an increase in temperatures could also enable the malaria parasite to develop faster and therefore escalate the transmission and burden of malaria. Even just a 2-3 degree Celsius increase could increase the population vulnerable to the disease by 5 per cent, equating to 700 million more people.\n\n\"Climate shifts play a pivotal role in altering the transmission patterns of malaria, particularly during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons from June to November. Fresh rainfall leads to waterlogging and the accumulation of stagnant water, creating ideal breeding grounds for the female Anopheles mosquito, the carrier of malaria parasites. This period witnessed a surge in malaria cases due to increased mosquito breeding in these water bodies,\" Dr Manish Mittal, Consultant Physician, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, told IANS.\n\n\"Early diagnosis and treatment are paramount in mitigating the impact of malaria, with heightened awareness prompting individuals to seek medical attention for fever symptoms and undergo simple blood tests,\" he added.\n\nIn a new study, researchers at the University of Florida showed that various mosquito and parasite traits exhibit intermittent relationships with temperature and that under future warming temperatures, transmission potential is likely to increase in some environments but could reduce in others.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, also suggests that parasites can develop more quickly at cooler temperatures and that the rate of parasite development might be less sensitive to changes in temperature than previously thought.\n\n\"The primary solution lies in avoiding construction sites and ensuring stagnant water is promptly cleared, especially at construction sites. Additionally, households should discard items that collect water, such as pots and old tires, and cover themselves while travelling,\" Dr Rajeev Boudhankar, Medical Director, Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, told IANS.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nDr Manish also emphasised employing personal protection methods such as insect repellents and mosquito nets.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water stagnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insect repellent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-06/ml5c42_malaria-_625x300_07_June_19.jpg?ver-20240422.08", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 281}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

By October, ten cases had been reported across Florida, Texas, Maryland, and Arkansas.\n\nThe presence of malaria in the United States is not unusual; every year, there are roughly 2,000 cases brought in by individuals traveling from abroad. But this was the first time in two decades that malaria had been locally transmitted - meaning that mosquitoes inside the United States, in U.S. parks and offices and homes, were shown to be capable of transmitting a disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people globally every year. It was a stark reminder that even in countries where malaria is not on the minds of most people, it can make a resurgence - with implications for the health of communities around the world.\n\nThe world has made incredible progress in preventing and treating malaria over the last two decades, with deaths from malaria dropping by nearly 37 percent in 2019 when compared to 2000. But the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed hospitals and health systems and interrupted patients' abilities to seek treatment. Global malaria deaths have largely plateaued since the height of the pandemic, with just over 600,000 lives lost in 2022. With nearly 250 million cases worldwide, and secondary impacts on poverty and economic growth, much more remains to be done.\n\nThat's why I am pleased that USAID continues to lead the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), implemented in partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. PMI has invested approximately $10 billion since 2006 to provide communities around the world with crucial prevention measures, such as mosquito nets, while also expanding access to malaria tests and medicines and strengthening the care provided by hospitals, clinics, and community health workers.\n\nToday, as resistance to malaria treatments is on the rise and changing weather patterns and climate shocks create conditions where mosquitoes thrive, USAID, through PMI, is adapting its approach in response. We are helping countries conduct surveillance to see where drug resistance is emerging, and we are supporting the development and delivery of alternative drugs. We are helping partner countries use climate data to predict malaria outbreaks so communities can prepare. And we are honored to have funded critical research that led to the world's first malaria vaccines, approved for use in the last two years. This year, we estimate that children across at least 20 countries in Africa will be able to get their malaria shots - which could help save tens of thousands of lives every year.\n\nIn PMI's 18th Annual Report to Congress, released today, the Initiative highlights how its work with partners since 2006 has cut death rates from malaria almost in half across its partner countries, representing millions of lives saved.

Malaria is a dangerous mosquito-borne disease that can cause death in severe cases. However, this disease can be prevented and its cure is also possible if treated on time. The Day is celebrated every year on April 25 to spread awareness about it.\n\nWorld Malaria Day Theme: The official theme for World Malaria Day 2024 is 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world'.\n\nWhat is Malaria: Malaria is a serious and potentially fatal disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. It is a major public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting millions of people every year.\n\nThe history of World Malaria Day dates back to 2000, when the African Summit on Roll Back Malaria was held in Abuja, Nigeria. The summit's main agenda was to highlight the devastating health risks associated with Malaria and design an action plan to reduce Malaria cases and deaths by half by 2010, but progress was slow, and Malaria remained a major public health concern worldwide.\n\nIn 2016, WHO launched the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, emphasising the goal of reducing Malaria cases and deaths by 90 per cent by 2030. To raise awareness about the significance of the strategy and to stimulate global action, WHO declared 25 April as World Malaria Day.\n\nBurden of malaria in India:\n\nThe World Malaria Report 2023 shows that the number of cases and deaths due to the mosquito-borne infection in India has continued to decline. With an estimated 33.8 lakh cases and 5,511 deaths, India saw a decline of 30 per cent in malaria incidence and 34 per cent in mortality in 2022, compared to 2021.\n\nWhile the world continues to see an increase in new cases of malaria, India is the only country to have bucked the trend in 2022, India witnessed a 30 per cent reduction in new cases and a 34 per cent decline in deaths compared to 2021. In contrast, globally, 249 million new cases were recorded in 2022, which was five million more than in 2021. The number of deaths recorded in 2022 was nearly 600,000 jumped from the numbers recorded in 2019 (570,000). In 2021, 619,000 deaths were recorded globally.\n\nNearly 3.3 million new malaria cases were detected in India in 2022, and 5,511 persons died.\n\nWorldwide Burden of Malaria: Globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases in 85 malaria endemic countries and areas (including the territory of French Guiana), an increase of five million cases compared with 2021.\n\nGlobally Deaths: Globally, malaria deaths declined steadily from 8,64,000 in 2000 to 5,86,000 in 2015 and to 5,76,000 in 2019. In 2020, malaria deaths increased by 10 per cent compared with 2019, to an estimated 6,31,000. Estimated deaths declined in 2022 to 6,08,000. The percentage of total malaria deaths in children aged under five years decreased from 87 per cent in 2000 to 76 per cent in 2015.

Now there are two against malaria: the RTS,S and the R21 vaccines.\n\nAdrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and chief investigator for the R21 vaccine, tells Nadine Dreyer why he thinks this is a great era for malaria control.\n\nMalaria has been around for 30 million years. Human beings have not.\n\nOur hominoid predecessors were being infected by malaria parasites tens of millions of years ago, so these parasites had a lot of practice at clever tricks to escape immune systems long before we came along. Homo sapiens first evolved in Africa about 315,000 years ago.\n\nMalaria is not a virus and nor is it a bacterium. It's a protozoan parasite, thousands of times larger than a typical virus. A good comparison is how many genes it has. COVID-19 has about a dozen, malaria has about 5,000.\n\nAdditionally, the malaria parasite goes through four life cycle stages. This is as complex as it gets with infectious pathogens.\n\nMedical researchers have been trying to make malaria vaccines for over 100 years. In Oxford it's taken us 30 years of research.\n\nThe four malaria life cycles are all hugely different, with different antigens expressed. An antigen is any substance that causes the body to make an immune response against that substance.\n\nWe targeted the sporozoites, which is the form that the mosquito inoculates into your skin. We were working to trap them before they could get to the liver and then carry on their life cycle by multiplying furiously.\n\nEach mosquito injects a small number of sporozoites, perhaps 20, into the skin. If you clear those 20, you've won. If one gets through, you've lost. The bad news is you've only got minutes.\n\nSo you need extraordinarily high levels of antibodies that the parasite hasn't seen before and hasn't learnt to evolve against. Technologically it's like having to design a car that's 10 times faster than anything else on the road.\n\nLuckily, there are no symptoms of malaria at that stage.\n\nA child dies every minute from malaria in Africa. Why are children more susceptible than adults?\n\nChildren under five years old account for about 80% of all malaria deaths in Africa. The age you're most likely to die of malaria in Africa is when you are one year old.\n\nFor the first six months you are protected largely by your mother's immunity and the antibodies she transfers during pregnancy.\n\nIf you survive to age two or three, and you've had a few episodes of malaria and you are still alive, you've got a bit of immunity. This improves over time.\n\nSome children get up to eight episodes in three or four months. They get quite unwell with the first, and three weeks later they're having a second bout and so on.\n\nNatural immunity doesn't work until you've had a lot of different infections and that's why adults are generally protected against malaria and don't become very unwell.\n\nWithout malaria, children would be healthier in general -- the disease makes you susceptible to other infections.\n\nWe've been disappointed that it's taken more than six months to roll out the R21 vaccine since it was approved in October last year. There are millions of doses of R21 sitting in a fridge in India.\n\nThere are a lot of organizations and processes involved in standard deployment that don't seem necessary.\n\nCompare that to a COVID-19 vaccine from Oxford and AstraZeneca that was approved on New Year's Eve 2020 and rolled out in several countries the very next week.\n\nIn the same year malaria killed more people in Africa than COVID-19 did.\n\nThe first malaria vaccine, the RTS,S, has already been given to millions of children in a large safety trial and the uptake has been really high, so large coverage can be achieved in Africa.\n\nWe really think we have an opportunity now to make a big impact.\n\nNobody is quite sure how many of the older tools such as insecticides and bed nets we need to carry on with. The advice is to keep them all.\n\nBut mosquitoes are building resistance to insecticides. Anti-malaria medication only lasts for days and parasites are building up resistance against these drugs as well.\n\nThere are about 40 million children born every year in malaria areas in Africa who would benefit from a vaccine. The R21/Matrix-M has been designed to be manufactured at scale. The Serum Institute of India, our manufacturing and commercial partner, can produce hundreds of millions of doses each year.\n\nAnother real advantage is its low cost. At US$3.90 a dose the R21/Matrix-M appears to be the most effective single intervention we can deploy against malaria\n\nWorldwide there is US$5 billion currently allocated to fight malaria each year.\n\nWe're optimistic that if this money is spent sensibly we can make a big difference. Buying 200 million doses of the R21/Matrix-M vaccine would cost US$800 million.\n\nBeing in the field I'm aware of other vaccines coming along. Some are targeting the blood stage and others the mosquito stage of malaria, which is very exciting. This looks like a great era for malaria control.\n\nMore than 600,000 people die of malaria each year. With low-cost, very effective vaccines being deployed we should be able to get this down to 200,000 or less by the end of this decade.\n\nThen the endgame will be malaria eradication worldwide, which really should happen in the 2030s.", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Oxford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexan_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apicomplexan life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenner_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jenner Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS,S", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RTS,S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaria vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protozoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitic disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_Institute_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serum Institute of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AstraZeneca"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2018/malaria.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of four doses to children from around 5 months of age.\n\nIn Liberia, the vaccine was launched in southern Rivercess County and will be rolled out afterward in five other counties that have a high malaria burden. At least 45,000 children are expected to benefit from the 112,000 doses of the available vaccine.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the first doses were administered to children at a health centre in Western Area Rural, where the authorities kicked off the rollout of 550,000 vaccine doses. The vaccine will then be delivered to health facilities nationwide.\n\nMinister of Health of Benin, Professor Benjamin Hounkpatin, said in a remark that the introduction of the malaria vaccine in the Expanded Programme on Immunisation for our children is a major step forward in the fight against this scourge.\n\nHe stated, \"I would like to reassure you that the malaria vaccines are safe and effective and contribute to the protection of our children against these serious and fatal diseases.\"\n\nLiberia's Minister of Health, Dr Louise Kpoto, said for far too long, malaria has stolen the laughter and dreams of our children, but that the launched vaccine and the unwavering commitment of communities, healthcare workers, and partners, including GAVI, UNICEF, and WHO, will help put a stop to this chain.\n\nHe added, \"We have a powerful tool that will protect them from this devastating illness and related deaths, ensuring their right to health and a brighter future. Let's end malaria in Liberia and pave the way for a healthier, more just society.\"\n\nIn a remark, Minister of Health of Sierra Leone Dr Austin Demby said, \"In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection.\"\n\nWHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, declared that the rollout of the malaria vaccine is a game-changer in our fight against this deadly disease, and WHO is providing continual support for this effort to save the lives of young children and lower the malaria burden in the region.\n\nMalaria remains a huge health challenge in the African region, which is home to 11 countries that carry approximately 70% of the global burden of malaria.

In Africa, it...", "body": "LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) - When a small number of cases of locally transmitted malaria were found in the United States last year, it was a reminder that climate change is reviving or migrating the threat of some diseases. But across the African continent malaria has never left, killing or sickening millions of people.\n\nTake Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal neighborhood in Nigeria\u00b4s Lagos city. Its ponds of dirty water provide favorable breeding conditions for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Kotun can\u00b4t afford insecticide-treated bed nets that cost between $7 and $21 each, much less antimalarial medications or treatment.\n\nFor World Malaria Day on Thursday, here is what you need to know about the situation in Africa:\n\nThe malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills. It mostly affects children under 5 and pregnant women. Vaccine efforts are still in early stages: Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine, which is only about 30% effective and doesn't stop transmission. A second vaccine was recently approved.\n\nCases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding by governments and donors for innovation is slowing.\n\nLiving conditions play a role, with crowded neighborhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials all issues in many areas. And an invasive species of mosquito previously seen mostly in India and the Persian Gulf is a new concern.\n\nFunmilayo Kotun, 66-years-old, a malaria patient is photographed in her one room in Makoko neighbourhood of Lagos, Nigeria, Saturday, April 20, 2024. When cases of locally transmitted malaria were found in the United States last year, it was a reminder that climate change is reviving the threat, or broadening the range, of some diseases. But across the African continent malaria has never left.(AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)\n\nGlobally, malaria cases are on the rise. Infections increased from 233 million in 2019 to 249 million in 85 countries in 2022. Malaria deaths rose from 576,000 in 2019 to 608,000 in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOf the 12 countries that carry about 70% of the global burden of malaria, 11 are in Africa and the other is India. Children under 5 constituted 80% of the 580,000 malaria deaths recorded in Africa in 2022.\n\nThe fight against malaria saw some progress in areas such as rapid diagnostic tests, vaccines and new bed nets meant to counter insecticide resistance, but the COVID-19 pandemic and a shift in focus and funding set back efforts.\n\nA study published in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease last year said COVID-19-induced lockdowns led to disruptions at 30% of rural community health service points across Africa. Malaria cases started spiking again, breaking a downward trend between 2000 and 2019.\n\nThat downward trend could soon return, according to the WHO.\n\nAfrica is \"at the sharp end of climate change,\" and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events causes havoc in efforts to combat malaria in low- and middle-income regions, Peter Sands, the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, warned in December.\n\nIn 2023, the WHO's World Malaria Report included a chapter on the link between malaria and climate change for the first time, highlighting its significance as a potential risk multiplier. Scientists worry that people living in areas once inhospitable to mosquitoes, including the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro and the mountains of eastern Ethiopia, could be exposed.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, which has recorded some of its hottest days in decades, malaria transmission periods have extended in some districts, \"and this shift has been attributed to climate change,\" said Dr. Precious Andifasi, a WHO technical officer for malaria in Zimbabwe.\n\nMutsaka reported from Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.

By traveling between remote villages, they've managed to reduce malaria cases by up to 70% in some areas this year.\n\nAs the global progress against malaria slows down, the World Health Organization is using World Malaria Day 2024 to reignite efforts against the disease, which claims around half a million children annually.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of malaria cases and deaths, with children under five being the most affected, accounting for about 80% of malaria-related deaths in the region.\n\nIn Cote d'Ivoire, a country endemic to malaria and among the top 10 globally for malaria cases, efforts to combat the disease are crucial. In 2022 alone, the country accounted for 3% of all malaria cases worldwide.\n\nA team of approximately 8,300 community health workers, supported by organizations like Save the Children, is leading the charge. Fran\u00e7ois Kouadio, one of these health workers, provides essential care and treatment to children and pregnant women in his village.\n\nThanks to Fran\u00e7ois and others like him, families like Prisca's have access to timely diagnosis and treatment for malaria. Having a health worker in the village ensures quick intervention, saving lives like that of Prisca's daughter, Charlene.\n\nEquipped with bikes, Fran\u00e7ois and his colleagues can reach up to eight families a day, offering treatment, raising awareness about malaria prevention, and providing much-needed comfort to their communities.\n\nThanks to initiatives like these and increased awareness, malaria cases have significantly dropped in recent years in Cote d'Ivoire. Fran\u00e7ois emphasizes the importance of community health workers in bridging the gap in healthcare access.\n\nAlongside community efforts, radio stations broadcast messages on malaria prevention and treatment, contributing to the overall goal of reducing malaria incidence and mortality by 75% by 2025 compared to 2015.\n\nSave the Children, operating in Cote d'Ivoire since 1991, collaborates with other organizations to implement malaria projects across the country, ensuring children have access to vital healthcare services.

The day also aims to mobilise efforts to control and eliminate malaria globally. Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans through the bites of Anopheles mosquito. This disease makes an individual feel very sick with a high fever. Other than fever, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, abdominal pain and fatigue are a few symptoms of malaria. World Malaria Day was established by the World Health Organisation to highlight the global burden of malaria and to promote actions to prevent and control the disease.\n\nWorld Malaria Day 2024: Theme, significance and moreTheme\n\nThis year the theme for World Malaria Day is 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world.'\n\nAccording to WHO, the theme focuses on ending malaria for people living in the most vulnerable situations including pregnant women, infants, children under 5 years of age and others.\n\nSignificance\n\nWorld Malaria Day urges people across the world to take all necessary steps that can help control the spread of this disease. As an individual, there are several small steps that one can take to keep themselves and their family members safe. On World Malaria Day 2024, let's discuss some of these.\n\nAll about preventing malaria:\n\n\"Malaria prevention is crucial because of the disease's seriousness and the enormous worldwide impact. The Plasmodium parasite, which causes malaria, is spread by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito and affects millions of people annually, mostly in tropical and sub-tropical countries,\" says Dr. Mohan Kumar Singh, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine, Marengo Asia Hospital, Gurugram.\n\n\"If left untreated, this disease may progress quickly, resulting in serious complications and sometimes fatal consequences. Effective preventive measures are essential to minimize the impact on public health,\" he adds.\n\nHere are some precautionary steps:\n\n1. Use mosquito repellent on exposed skin to lower your risk.\n\n2. Sleep under mosquito nets to create a physical barrier against mosquito bites.\n\n3. Wear full-sleeved clothes when outside to control the risk of transmission.\n\n4. Eliminate any source of standing water around your home as mosquitoes breed in stagnant water.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n5.

domestic resource mobilisation that will ensure equitable access to health, gender equity and reduced burden of the disease in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe commitment was made during a one-day stakeholders' meeting in Ikot Ekpene, Akwa Ibom State as part of this year's World Malaria Day celebration which attracted development partners, malaria experts, captains of industries and members of the organised private sector and top government officials.\n\nRead also: World Malaria Day: Goodknight's DestinationZero Malaria Initiative Safeguards 10,000+ Families\n\nThe meeting also created an opportunity for active collaboration between the public and private sector stakeholders that contributed to the reduction of malaria burden particularly among the most vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children under five years of age.\n\nAmong the private sector players, Ibom Air, announced the donation of malaria commodities including insecticide-treated nets.\n\nZenith Bank, pharmaceutical companies and Mobil Producing Nigeria as well as the Chief Medical Director of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Professor Emem Bassey showed their presence.\n\nAmong the partners was the World Health Organisation (WHO) which highlighted the need for collaboration in malaria response for a healthy society in line with the theme of this year's commemoration which is 'Accelerating the Fight Against Malaria for a More Equitable World.'\n\nOther partners were Breakthrough Action Nigeria, United States President Malaria Initiatives for States (PMI-S), the state Primary Healthcare Development Agency and the Akwa Ibom State Malaria Elimination Programme as well as the directorate, public health services and the state ministry of Health.\n\nSpeaking, John Orok, the programme manager, Akwa Ibom State Malaria Elimination Programme, said it was important to narrow the funding gap in the fight against malaria adding that depending on donor funding was not good enough.\n\n\"No effort will be too much in the fight against malaria, it requires all hands to be on deck, we need to attract the private sector and narrow the funding gap,'' he said.\n\nAccording to him, the insecticide-treated nets should get to as many households as possible, the information, education and communication materials should be translated into local languages and other commodities adding that \"it was important to bring people from various backgrounds together because everybody is affected by malaria, which is preventable.\"\n\nDeclaring the stakeholders' meeting open, the Commissioner for Health, Augustine Umo who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Patrick Eshiet said it was time for all to come together to eliminate malaria, pointing out that \"we cannot continue to rely on foreign donors.''\n\nHe called for increased funding and more resources for research on malaria and efficient use of available resources, raise awareness and encourage preventive measures including the use of insecticide-treated nets.\n\nNigeria has the highest burden of malaria globally accounting for nearly 27 percent of the global malaria burden, according to experts.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aniefiok_udonquak@businessday.ng", "name": "Aniefiok Udonquak", "type":

To educate the community on malaria prevention with focus on making Bareilly malaria-free, Mortein Mission Zero Malaria joined forces with renowned artist Dr. Bibhuti Adhikary to create a striking public installation dedicated to raising awareness about mosquito-borne diseases, particularly malaria.\n\nMalaria remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, where Bareilly district alone accounted for a high percentage of the state's malaria cases, underscoring urgent need for targeted interventions. Since its inception in 2023, Mortein Mission Zero Malaria strives to raise health awareness and drive behavioral change among communities in Bareilly.\n\nGaurav Jain, Executive Vice President, Reckitt - South Asia, said, \"The elimination of malaria by 2030 is a critical global and national public health objective. At Reckitt, we uphold the belief that access to health is not a privilege, but a fundamental right for all. As we observe World Malaria Day, we are proud to leverage art and culture to convey the message that while malaria is a serious threat, it can be prevented through effective mosquito control, timely diagnosis, and proper treatment. Given that Bareilly is a land of public art installations, we believe this unique sculpture will serve as a perpetual reminder to mobilize the Bareilly community to remain vigilant until we achieve a malaria-free environment.\"\n\nPratik Kumar, President, Prayatna said, \"On this World Malaria Day, we are happy to partner with Reckitt as we stand united in our commitment to combatting one of the oldest and deadliest foes humanity has faced - Malaria. Together, with collective action and unwavering determination, we can beat malaria. Let us stand together in solidarity, not just today, but every day until we achieve our goal of a malaria-free Bareilly and a malaria-free world.\n\nSonali Khan, Managing Director, Sesame Workshop India said, \"As we embark on the Mission Zero Malaria journey with Mortein and Prayatna, Sesame Workshop India proudly introduces an engaging school malaria curriculum with quirky characters like Malaria Jasoos, Malaria Police, Malaria Guru, and Miss Malaria to educate children. Our goal is to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice, instilling critical attitudes towards malaria prevention through engaging content. The educational kit, Stop Malaria Club, aligned with STEM curriculum, not only prevents malaria but also nurtures a generation of informed, responsible citizens. Sesame Workshop India focuses on empowering children with tools to understand the breeding cycle, recognize symptoms, and take proactive measures.\"\n\nThe mosquito installation at the Machhar Chowk of Bareilly, akin to the iconic Polio Chowk in Moradabad and the 'Statue of Unity' in Gujarat, aims to spark conversations and sensitize schools, communities, organizations, and healthcare professionals, on the importance of malaria prevention and control. The artwork features an 18-foot-tall structure adorned with three pillars and three mosquitoes, serving as a poignant reminder of the threat posed by mosquitoes. The sculpture will have 3 lights that will change colours based on the pattern of mosquito infestation in the city: Green for when there is no need to fear malaria/mosquito infestations, Orange when there is an outbreak of cases of malaria in the city and Red when the cases are increasing, and people need to protect themselves.\n\nSculpture Artist, Dr. Bibhuti Adhikary said, \"For an artist, the opportunity to make a profound social impact through their art is unparalleled. When Reckitt approached me about creating a public art installation addressing malaria, I recognized the immense potential of the project. Embracing Reckitt's vision, I brought it to life using my artistic skills. As an artist, I strongly believe in the idea that art is not what you see, but what you make others see. If this artwork succeeds in raising awareness about malaria and encourages the community in Bareilly to take collective necessary measures, it will have achieved its purpose.\"\n\nBased on 'Know. Act. Control' framework, Mortein along with Sesame Workshop India developed a comprehensive school malaria curriculum with the aim to educate and raise awareness among children. Tailored for children aged 5-15 years, the curriculum comprises of engaging educational materials such as Malaria Activity sheets, Macchar Hunt Books, Malaria Calendars, Malaria Suraksha Chakras, and Stop Malaria Club badges along with fun characters to effectively communicate with children. The school malaria curriculum aims to reach over 4 lakh children across 850 schools in the district of Bareilly, equipping them with essential knowledge and empowering them to become agents of change within their communities by adopting desired behaviour change practices.\n\nMortein remains committed to its mission of making Bareilly malaria-free, with its Mission Zero Malaria program. The partnerships ensure investments, access to technology, and innovation that can be leveraged to lessen the burden of malaria in the targeted area. Through collaborative efforts and community engagement, the campaign aims to overcome the challenges posed by malaria and build a healthier, malaria-free future for generations to come.", "source":

This year's theme is \"accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,\" as many people globally have no access to quality, timely treatment, and affordable services to prevent, detect, and treat malaria.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022, malaria claimed the lives of an estimated 608, 000 people worldwide and there were 249 million new cases.\n\nA 2022 Lancet study on malaria showed that an increase in temperatures could also enable the malaria parasite to develop faster and therefore escalate the transmission and burden of malaria. Even just a 2-3 degree Celsius increase could increase the population vulnerable to the disease by 5 per cent, equating to 700 million more people.\n\n\"Climate shifts play a pivotal role in altering the transmission patterns of malaria, particularly during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons from June to November. Fresh rainfall leads to waterlogging and the accumulation of stagnant water, creating ideal breeding grounds for the female Anopheles mosquito, the carrier of malaria parasites. This period witnessed a surge in malaria cases due to increased mosquito breeding in these water bodies,\" Dr Manish Mittal, Consultant Physician, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, told VOICE.\n\n\"Early diagnosis and treatment are paramount in mitigating the impact of malaria, with heightened awareness prompting individuals to seek medical attention for fever symptoms and undergo simple blood tests,\" he added.\n\nIn a new study, researchers at the University of Florida showed that various mosquito and parasite traits exhibit intermittent relationships with temperature and that under future warming temperatures, transmission potential is likely to increase in some environments but could reduce in others.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, also suggests that parasites can develop more quickly at cooler temperatures and that the rate of parasite development might be less sensitive to changes in temperature than previously thought.\n\n\"The primary solution lies in avoiding construction sites and ensuring stagnant water is promptly cleared, especially at construction sites. Additionally, households should discard items that collect water, such as pots and old tires, and cover themselves while travelling,\" Dr Rajeev Boudhankar, Medical Director, Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, told VOICE.\n\nDr Manish also emphasised employing personal protection methods such as insect repellents and mosquito nets.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water stagnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insect repellent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8524c4b1a50eb63b72d7d38ffa14a03d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 19, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

To educate the community on malaria prevention with focus on making Bareilly malaria-free, Mortein Mission Zero Malaria joined forces with renowned artist Dr. Bibhuti Adhikary to create a striking public installation dedicated to raising awareness about mosquito-borne diseases, particularly malaria.\n\nMalaria remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, where Bareilly district alone accounted for a high percentage of the state's malaria cases, underscoring urgent need for targeted interventions. Since its inception in 2023, Mortein Mission Zero Malaria strives to raise health awareness and drive behavioral change among communities in Bareilly.\n\nGaurav Jain, Executive Vice President, Reckitt - South Asia, said, \"The elimination of malaria by 2030 is a critical global and national public health objective. At Reckitt, we uphold the belief that access to health is not a privilege, but a fundamental right for all. As we observe World Malaria Day, we are proud to leverage art and culture to convey the message that while malaria is a serious threat, it can be prevented through effective mosquito control, timely diagnosis, and proper treatment. Given that Bareilly is a land of public art installations, we believe this unique sculpture will serve as a perpetual reminder to mobilize the Bareilly community to remain vigilant until we achieve a malaria-free environment.\"\n\nPratik Kumar, President, Prayatna said, \"On this World Malaria Day, we are happy to partner with Reckitt as we stand united in our commitment to combatting one of the oldest and deadliest foes humanity has faced - Malaria. Together, with collective action and unwavering determination, we can beat malaria. Let us stand together in solidarity, not just today, but every day until we achieve our goal of a malaria-free Bareilly and a malaria-free world.\n\nSonali Khan, Managing Director, Sesame Workshop India said, \"As we embark on the Mission Zero Malaria journey with Mortein and Prayatna, Sesame Workshop India proudly introduces an engaging school malaria curriculum with quirky characters like Malaria Jasoos, Malaria Police, Malaria Guru, and Miss Malaria to educate children. Our goal is to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice, instilling critical attitudes towards malaria prevention through engaging content. The educational kit, Stop Malaria Club, aligned with STEM curriculum, not only prevents malaria but also nurtures a generation of informed, responsible citizens. Sesame Workshop India focuses on empowering children with tools to understand the breeding cycle, recognize symptoms, and take proactive measures.\"\n\nThe mosquito installation at the Machhar Chowk of Bareilly, akin to the iconic Polio Chowk in Moradabad and the 'Statue of Unity' in Gujarat, aims to spark conversations and sensitize schools, communities, organizations, and healthcare professionals, on the importance of malaria prevention and control. The artwork features an 18-foot-tall structure adorned with three pillars and three mosquitoes, serving as a poignant reminder of the threat posed by mosquitoes. The sculpture will have 3 lights that will change colours based on the pattern of mosquito infestation in the city: Green for when there is no need to fear malaria/mosquito infestations, Orange when there is an outbreak of cases of malaria in the city and Red when the cases are increasing, and people need to protect themselves.\n\nSculpture Artist, Dr. Bibhuti Adhikary said, \"For an artist, the opportunity to make a profound social impact through their art is unparalleled. When Reckitt approached me about creating a public art installation addressing malaria, I recognized the immense potential of the project. Embracing Reckitt's vision, I brought it to life using my artistic skills. As an artist, I strongly believe in the idea that art is not what you see, but what you make others see. If this artwork succeeds in raising awareness about malaria and encourages the community in Bareilly to take collective necessary measures, it will have achieved its purpose.\"\n\nBased on 'Know. Act. Control' framework, Mortein along with Sesame Workshop India developed a comprehensive school malaria curriculum with the aim to educate and raise awareness among children. Tailored for children aged 5-15 years, the curriculum comprises of engaging educational materials such as Malaria Activity sheets, Macchar Hunt Books, Malaria Calendars, Malaria Suraksha Chakras, and Stop Malaria Club badges along with fun characters to effectively communicate with children. The school malaria curriculum aims to reach over 4 lakh children across 850 schools in the district of Bareilly, equipping them with essential knowledge and empowering them to become agents of change within their communities by adopting desired behaviour change practices.\n\nUnlock the puzzle by scanning the QR code below and escape without being bitten by mosquitoes.\n\nMortein remains committed to its mission of making Bareilly malaria-free, with its Mission Zero Malaria program. The partnerships ensure investments, access to technology, and innovation that can be leveraged to lessen the burden of malaria in the targeted area. Through collaborative efforts and community engagement, the campaign aims to overcome the challenges posed by malaria and build a healthier, malaria-free future for generations to come.\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by BusinessWire India.

This year's theme is \"accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,\" as many people globally have no access to quality, timely treatment, and affordable services to prevent, detect, and treat malaria.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022, malaria claimed the lives of an estimated 608, 000 people worldwide and there were 249 million new cases.\n\nA 2022 Lancet study on malaria showed that an increase in temperatures could also enable the malaria parasite to develop faster and therefore escalate the transmission and burden of malaria. Even just a 2-3 degree Celsius increase could increase the population vulnerable to the disease by 5 per cent, equating to 700 million more people.\n\n\"Climate shifts play a pivotal role in altering the transmission patterns of malaria, particularly during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons from June to November. Fresh rainfall leads to waterlogging and the accumulation of stagnant water, creating ideal breeding grounds for the female Anopheles mosquito, the carrier of malaria parasites. This period witnessed a surge in malaria cases due to increased mosquito breeding in these water bodies,\" Dr Manish Mittal, Consultant Physician, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, told IANS.\n\n\"Early diagnosis and treatment are paramount in mitigating the impact of malaria, with heightened awareness prompting individuals to seek medical attention for fever symptoms and undergo simple blood tests,\" he added.\n\nIn a new study, researchers at the University of Florida showed that various mosquito and parasite traits exhibit intermittent relationships with temperature and that under future warming temperatures, transmission potential is likely to increase in some environments but could reduce in others.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, also suggests that parasites can develop more quickly at cooler temperatures and that the rate of parasite development might be less sensitive to changes in temperature than previously thought.\n\n\"The primary solution lies in avoiding construction sites and ensuring stagnant water is promptly cleared, especially at construction sites. Additionally, households should discard items that collect water, such as pots and old tires, and cover themselves while travelling,\" Dr Rajeev Boudhankar, Medical Director, Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, told IANS.\n\nDr Manish also emphasised employing personal protection methods such as insect repellents and mosquito nets.", "source": {"uri": "newsroomodisha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Room Odisha"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_stagnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water stagnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monsoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_repellent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insect repellent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 19, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Children under 5 years old and pregnant women face heightened risks. In the African Region, 4 out of 5 malaria-related deaths occur in children under 5.\n\nPregnant women face increased exposure to malaria. Malaria in pregnancy has several risks including maternal death, stillbirth, premature delivery, and low birth weight.\n\nRefugees, migrants, internally displaced people, and Indigenous communities also face increased malaria risks due to limited access to healthcare.\n\nObstacles include discrimination, gender inequality, and lack of healthcare access.\n\nSocial and cultural standards often stop women from seeking convenient prevention or treatment. Conflicts also disrupt healthcare services, leaving women and children particularly vulnerable.\n\nIn response to this, WHO and its partners support targeted interventions to accelerate progress towards a malaria-free world. These include:\n\nInvesting in innovative tools such as malaria vaccines and new-generation insecticide-treated nets holds promise. Vaccines deployed through national child immunisation platforms can significantly increase prevention efforts, especially benefiting vulnerable children.\n\nWHO's Global Technical Strategy for Malaria aims to reduce incidence and mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030 and eliminate malaria in 35 countries.\n\nEquity, gender responsiveness, and human rights are at the forefront of this strategy.

And last year, after two decades of no domestically-acquired cases of malaria, ten cases were reported in the United States. While the individuals were successfully treated, and the spread was halted, it was a solemn reminder of the urgent need to continue preventing and treating the disease globally.\n\nThat is exactly what my Administration is doing. We've expanded the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative, and are now partnering with 30 countries to bring life-saving tools and treatments to people in need. We also hosted the seventh replenishment for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, raising a historically high level of funding from global donors. And, the United States has been a driving force behind deployment of the first-ever malaria vaccine. When combined with other prevention tools -- such as mosquito nets and preventive medicines -- these vaccines have the potential to save millions of children's lives around the world.\n\nTo all those living in fear of malaria: the United States sees you.

An Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States.\n\nConor McMeniman who made this known during a webinar, described insecticide-treated bednets as a frontline measure used in coordination, often with indoor residual spraying to really kill the mosquitoes that transmit malaria.\n\nMcMeniman made this known during an expert webinar briefing by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The media briefing titled 'Malaria Across The Globe: Current Research, Transmission Risks, and Reasons for Optimism' was organised by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health ahead of the 2024 World Malaria Day marked today, April 25 globally.\n\nWorld Malaria Day is an occasion to highlight the need for continued investment and sustained political commitment for malaria prevention and control by the worldwide malaria community. It was instituted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Member States during the World Health Assembly of 2007.\n\nMalaria is transmitted to humans by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Female mosquitoes take blood meals for egg production, and these blood meals are the link between the human and the mosquito hosts in the parasite life cycle. Plasmodium sporozoites are the infective stage of malaria parasites that infect humans.\n\nThe sporozoites residing in the salivary glands of the female Anopheles mosquitoes are transmitted to humans via mosquito bites during blood feeding. Insecticide resistance has decreased the efficacy of the most commonly used insecticide class of pyrethroids. This decreased efficacy has consequently increased mosquito survival, which is a prelude to rising incidence of malaria and fatalities.\n\nPyrethroids are widely used for controlling various insects. They are commonly used in mosquito control programme to kill adult mosquitoes. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there are approximately 250 million malaria cases, and more than 600,000 deaths per year.\n\nTragically, three-quarters of these deaths occur in children under the age of five, mostly in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, but also India and Southeast Asia. Responding to which of the current malaria vaccines: R 21 and Rtss is more effective, based on current efficacy data, the Director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Jane\n\nThere is no evidence that one vaccine performs better than the other\n\nM. Carlton said, \"For the first time we have these two approved vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO). They are complementary to each other, both are safe and effective and both prevent around 75 percent of malaria episodes when given in conjunction with other control methods such as antimalarial drugs.\n\n\"There is no evidence that one vaccine performs better than the other, and really, countries need to choose which one to use based upon the vaccine supply and affordability.\" On whether resistance might develop against the vaccines, Carlton said the clinical trials performed to date in three pilot countries Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi resulted in about 13 per cent drop in malaria mortality among children that were eligible for vaccination and also there were substantial reduction in hospitalisations for severe malaria.\n\n\"I should also remark about the issue of potential resistance. The term used is vaccine escape, and so far there is no evidence that the parasite will evade an immune response elicited by the vaccines. Obviously this will continue to be monitored closely in the coming years.\"", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "appolonia_adeyemi@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "Appolonia Adeyemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "new_telegraph_admin@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "New Telegraph-Admin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Bloomberg_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indoor residual spraying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molecular biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrethroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyrethroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salivary_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salivary gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biological life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cranberries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cranberries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-25-124037.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 922, "textEnd": 930}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

To educate the community on malaria prevention with focus on making Bareilly malaria-free, Mortein Mission Zero Malaria joined forces with renowned artist Dr. Bibhuti Adhikary to create a striking public installation dedicated to raising awareness about mosquito-borne diseases, particularly malaria.\n\nMalaria remains a significant public health challenge, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, where Bareilly district alone accounted for a high percentage of the state's malaria cases, underscoring urgent need for targeted interventions. Since its inception in 2023, Mortein Mission Zero Malaria strives to raise health awareness and drive behavioral change among communities in Bareilly.\n\nGaurav Jain, Executive Vice President, Reckitt - South Asia, said,\n\nThe elimination of malaria by 2030 is a critical global and national public health objective. At Reckitt, we uphold the belief that access to health is not a privilege, but a fundamental right for all. As we observe World Malaria Day, we are proud to leverage art and culture to convey the message that while malaria is a serious threat, it can be prevented through effective mosquito control, timely diagnosis, and proper treatment. Given that Bareilly is a land of public art installations, we believe this unique sculpture will serve as a perpetual reminder to mobilize the Bareilly community to remain vigilant until we achieve a malaria-free environment.\n\nPratik Kumar, President, Prayatna said,\n\nOn this World Malaria Day, we are happy to partner with Reckitt as we stand united in our commitment to combatting one of the oldest and deadliest foes humanity has faced - Malaria. Together, with collective action and unwavering determination, we can beat malaria. Let us stand together in solidarity, not just today, but every day until we achieve our goal of a malaria-free Bareilly and a malaria-free world.\n\nSonali Khan, Managing Director, Sesame Workshop India said,\n\nAs we embark on the Mission Zero Malaria journey with Mortein and Prayatna, Sesame Workshop India proudly introduces an engaging school malaria curriculum with quirky characters like Malaria Jasoos, Malaria Police, Malaria Guru, and Miss Malaria to educate children. Our goal is to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice, instilling critical attitudes towards malaria prevention through engaging content. The educational kit, Stop Malaria Club, aligned with STEM curriculum, not only prevents malaria but also nurtures a generation of informed, responsible citizens. Sesame Workshop India focuses on empowering children with tools to understand the breeding cycle, recognize symptoms, and take proactive measures.\n\nThe mosquito installation at the Machhar Chowk of Bareilly, akin to the iconic Polio Chowk in Moradabad and the 'Statue of Unity' in Gujarat, aims to spark conversations and sensitize schools, communities, organizations, and healthcare professionals, on the importance of malaria prevention and control. The artwork features an 18-foot-tall structure adorned with three pillars and three mosquitoes, serving as a poignant reminder of the threat posed by mosquitoes. The sculpture will have 3 lights that will change colours based on the pattern of mosquito infestation in the city: Green for when there is no need to fear malaria/mosquito infestations, Orange when there is an outbreak of cases of malaria in the city and Red when the cases are increasing, and people need to protect themselves.\n\nSculpture Artist, Dr. Bibhuti Adhikary said,\n\nFor an artist, the opportunity to make a profound social impact through their art is unparalleled. When Reckitt approached me about creating a public art installation addressing malaria, I recognized the immense potential of the project. Embracing Reckitt's vision, I brought it to life using my artistic skills. As an artist, I strongly believe in the idea that art is not what you see, but what you make others see. If this artwork succeeds in raising awareness about malaria and encourages the community in Bareilly to take collective necessary measures, it will have achieved its purpose.\n\nBased on 'Know. Act. Control' framework, Mortein along with Sesame Workshop India developed a comprehensive school malaria curriculum with the aim to educate and raise awareness among children. Tailored for children aged 5-15 years, the curriculum comprises of engaging educational materials such as Malaria Activity sheets, Macchar Hunt Books, Malaria Calendars, Malaria Suraksha Chakras, and Stop Malaria Club badges along with fun characters to effectively communicate with children. The school malaria curriculum aims to reach over 4 lakh children across 850 schools in the district of Bareilly, equipping them with essential knowledge and empowering them to become agents of change within their communities by adopting desired behaviour change practices.\n\nUnlock the puzzle by scanning the QR code below and escape without being bitten by mosquitoes:\n\nMortein remains committed to its mission of making Bareilly malaria-free, with its Mission Zero Malaria program.

Local government and partners from sectors that influence malaria must also be committed.\n\nThese sectors are grouped into five dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals; health, political and institutional, social, economic and environmental. Targeted actions across all five groups could address both the root causes of malaria and the lack of development leaving people furthest behind.\n\nPartners further commit to \"malaria-smart\" engagement with local businesses, employers and human activities that produce and reduce malaria, while minimizing inequities within the district. Finally, robust data analysis, citizen engagement and local council oversight continuously reinforce accountability for programme objectives.\n\nPathfinding in action\n\nUganda, which had the third highest number of malaria cases globally in 2022, is among the first countries to test this strategy. It could provide lessons for employing existing programmes and resources to further realize health and development benefits in other countries.\n\nFive districts with especially vulnerable populations, including refugees, sex workers and people in informal settlements, and opportunities for integrated approaches through local champions have been identified.\n\nUNDP and our partners are now developing an impact and investment case study to understand the local dynamics between malaria and development, the benefits for communities, districts and businesses and the costs of action and inaction.

Malaria remains a significant public health challenge worldwide, with an estimated 249 million cases and 608,000 deaths in 2022. The degree of its impact on livelihood, long-term economic growth, and development in vulnerable countries has been significantly rising than ever before. This becomes a cause of concern, especially with the volatility and uncertainty amplified by climate change. The relationship between malaria and climate change is complex due to the influence of external factors of demographics, migration, urbanisation, and land use. However, the climate change-induced fluctuations in global temperatures and rainfall that are suitable for the malaria parasite and vectors have an immense potential to increase transmission, resurge malaria in eliminated areas, and induce loss of livelihood.\n\nThe relationship between malaria and climate change is complex due to the influence of external factors of demographics, migration, urbanisation, and land use.\n\nThe Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in particular are disproportionately impacted by climate change and are more susceptible to the rising numbers of Malaria cases. Figure 1 depicts the number of malaria cases per 1000 population at risk in SIDS as of 2020. However, between 2021 and 2022, a rise of 23 percent was observed in the number of malaria cases, reaching 1.9 million cases in the WHO Western Pacific region, constituting several SIDS. Papua New Guinea accounted for 90 percent of the cases and a 29-percent increase in deaths due to malaria in the region. While the SIDS in the Caribbean region have mostly eliminated malaria, political instability, civil unrest, climate shocks, and underfunding in states like Haiti continue to be a threat and hindrance to progress in healthcare infrastructure resilience and the flow of essential resources. Thus, these rising instances of malaria in SIDS need a renewed global response to mitigate climate-induced transmission and re-emergence.\n\nThere is a need for policy interventions in SIDS that not only address the health concern but also address the systemic challenges of limited healthcare infrastructure, declining funding, inadequate resources, lack of robust surveillance, and fragmented governance structures. In 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) launched the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2015-2030, which aimed to reduce the global malaria cases and mortality rates by at least 90 percent by 2030. The Global Malaria Programme and A Framework for Malaria Elimination were also initiated to facilitate countries to reach the targets set for 2030 by the technical strategy. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) released the Comprehensive Multisectoral Action Framework for Malaria and Sustainable Development which envisions that a \"whole-of-society, whole of government and health-in-all-policies\" approach is vital in malaria elimination. However, despite these initiatives, it was only during the Fijian presidency of COP23 that malaria was mentioned in the special initiative and regional plans launched with the partnership of WHO and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) Secretariat that acknowledged the interlinkage and vulnerability of climate change and health in SIDS.\n\nThe Global Malaria Programme and A Framework for Malaria Elimination were also initiated to facilitate countries to reach the targets set for 2030 by the technical strategy.\n\nWhile global initiatives are in place to increase health system resilience against malaria, funding such initiatives becomes critical. Since 2002, multilateral financing initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria have contributed significantly to addressing the disease-prone and vulnerable areas. Figure 2 depicts the allocation of Global Fund 2023-2025 for Malaria in SIDS, highlighting the recognition of the dire state in Papua New Guinea. However, the high dependence on the United States (US) for global malaria funding, which accounts for 36 percent of the funds, could lead to a disproportionate influence on national malaria policies and outcomes in aid-receiving countries. Additionally, the WHO suggests that the funding gap has been widening with a deficit of US$2.3 billion in 2018 to US$3.7 billion in 2022. This trend could be particularly concerning for SIDS. As the GDP per capita has been used as a measure to decide the provisions of aid, their low population size can hinder the allocation of funds despite being highly vulnerable to climate-induced health challenges.\n\nFigure 2: Global Fund 2023-2025 Allocations for Malaria in SIDS (in million US Dollars)\n\nOne of the effective means to prepare and prevent malaria transmission is by promoting and ensuring the use of vaccines. Following the success of the pilot project of distributing the RTS/AS01 malaria vaccine under the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP), 18 million doses have been allocated for distribution between 2023 and 2025 among the highly vulnerable regions of Africa. While this allocation of vaccines is still insufficient, the expansion of such programmes to SIDS can become critical for their preparedness. To procure malaria vaccines in the future, the SIDS must develop mechanisms to collect accurate and consistent data on its requirements to reduce wastage. There is also a need for enhanced transdisciplinary and global scientific collaboration in research on climate-health interlinkages in SIDS as it could also help in determining the specific requirements of cold chains for these island states. While the role of international players such as the US and China in supply-chain management of the malaria vaccines and mitigation of malaria in SIDS has been vital, the increasing involvement of emerging powers like India in global health initiatives can accelerate the progress of building climate-resilient health system among the islands.\n\nTo procure malaria vaccines in the future, the SIDS must develop mechanisms to collect accurate and consistent data on its requirements to reduce wastage.\n\nBeing known as the \"pharmacy of the world\", India has immense potential to mitigate the risks of malaria in SIDS through its expertise, quality, and cost-effective supply of malaria vaccines. With India increasingly willing to be a leader in global health governance through health diplomacy initiatives, it can facilitate climate and health assistance to SIDS. The initiative of Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS) under the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) aims to strengthen infrastructure against the impact of climate change and disasters in SIDS. As the Indo-Pacific region has become central to geopolitical, geoeconomic, and geostrategic discourse, India with its financial support mechanisms and initiatives across sectors has built stronger ties with the Pacific SIDS. India could also utilise the Sagar Amrut initiative for health system resilience against malaria as it was launched to catalyse capacity-building and training of professionals in Pacific Island states. Thus, building cooperation, providing aid, capacity-building, mitigating vector and water-borne diseases, and facilitating climate action, are important enablers for India's diplomatic relations with SIDS.\n\nDiplomatic and collaborative efforts involving governments, international organisations, researchers, and communities are essential for effective, equitable, and inclusive policy interventions. Targeted climate adaptation strategies, integrated vector management, and health system strengthening are vital for mitigating the effects of malaria in SIDS. However, the international community must also focus on addressing the socio-economic and political determinants to ensure preparedness among the island states. Sharing and adopting best policy practices among SIDS can enable the contextual understanding and measures required for addressing the complex relationship between climate and malaria. The upcoming 4 International Conference on Small Island Developing States can be a vital forum to discuss the interlinkage of climate and health. Bridging the gap between climate and health policies through systemic reforms rather than disease-specific solutions can pave the way for a healthier and more malaria-resilient future for SIDS.\n\nAniruddha Inamdar is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Health Diplomacy, Department of Global Health Governance, Prasanna School of Public Health, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal\n\nAnirudh Prem is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Health Diplomacy, Department of Global Health Governance, Prasanna School of Public Health, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal\n\nSanjay M Pattanshetty is Head of the Department of Global Health Governance Prasanna School of Public Health Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) Manipal\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

Most affected are children and some pregnant mothers,\" Nakazzi told Xinhua in a recent interview.\n\nFor the medical officer, although malaria is an easily preventable disease, its prevalence remains high in the country due to limited economic and health conditions in most areas.\n\nAs the world commemorates World Malaria Day on April 25, Uganda continues to struggle with the disease, accounting for 5.4 percent of global cases and ranking third among high-burden countries, according to the country's Ministry of Health.\n\nUganda also ranks as the seventh-highest contributor to malaria deaths globally (2.9 percent). World Health Organization figures indicate that the country records between 70,000 and 100,000 malaria deaths per year.\n\nDespite this precarious situation, Uganda recently announced that international donors have warned that they will stop funding the country's malaria response due to other global challenges such as conflict and climate change. According to the Ministry of Health, 85 percent of the country's health budget for the 2024/2025 fiscal year is externally funded.\n\nDespite these global complexities, Henry Kyobe, head of the Ministry of Health's Incident Management Team, said China has not given up on helping Uganda combat malaria, adding that China has provided technical and medical assistance in the fight against the scourge.\n\n\"Recently, the government of China supported us with anti-malarial drugs that we are going to use at the community level in four high-burden districts,\" Kyobe told Xinhua in a recent interview. \"This support from the Chinese government is to stop or tackle malaria at the point of transmission and ensure that we reduce the burden on the household even before we go to the facilities,\"\n\nReceiving a shipment of 1.1 million U.S. dollars worth of anti-malarial drugs donated by the Chinese government earlier this month, Minister of Health Jane Ruth Aceng said Uganda last year experienced an upsurge in cases of malaria, which spread to more than half of its districts.\n\n\"As a country, we are at high risk of malaria due to our climatic conditions. Therefore, this generous donation of anti-malarial drugs will be helpful in the fight against malaria and in controlling the malaria epidemic, especially in high-risk areas,\" Aceng said.\n\nKyobe explained that Uganda had long benefitted from the Chinese government in terms of medicine, research, and technical training. \"You remember the 'wonder drug' we use to treat malaria, artemisinin. It is a drug discovered by the Chinese. It's been 18 years since we stopped using chloroquine and started using the new drug.\"\n\nChina has also helped Uganda in terms of research through the China-Uganda Friendship Hospital donated by the Asian country.\n\n\"We have also had many people go to China. Last year alone, almost 60 experts from the Ministry of Health trained at different institutes in China in malaria elimination, malaria case management, and different elements of malaria,\" Kyobe said.\n\nAccording to the Chinese embassy, China has sent 23 batches of medical teams with 218 doctors to Uganda since 1983. Since 2005, Chinese medical teams have treated more than 150,000 local patients, performed more than 4,000 surgeries, and rescued more than 600 critically ill patients.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antimalarial medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevalence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kampala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemisinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Acupuncture_and_Chinese_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kampala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 17, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

researcher on malaria pathogenesis and molecular resistance at the University of Ibadan, Prof Olusegun Ademowo, has refuted the belief that walking under the sun or experiencing stress can lead to malaria infection.\n\nIn an interview with PUNCH Healthwise, he asserted that malaria is transmitted solely through exposure to the malaria parasite carried by female Anopheles mosquitoes.\n\nPUNCH Healthwise discovered that some individuals have held on strongly to the misconception that walking under the sun or prolonged exposure to sunlight could lead to malaria infection.\n\nHe said consequently, these individuals attribute feverish symptoms to recent sun exposure and promptly seek anti-malaria drugs from patent medicine stores without undergoing proper blood tests.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organisation states that malaria spreads to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.\n\nThe WHO noted that malaria could also be transmitted through blood transfusion and contaminated needles, but noted that the number of people that receive blood transfusion is minimal.\n\nAccording to the global health body, malaria is a life-threatening disease with mild or life-threatening symptoms such as fever, cold, headaches, fatigue and difficulty in breathing, among other symptoms.\n\nThe WHO noted that the disease burden is about 249 million cases and 608,000 deaths in 85 countries as of 2022.\n\nAfrica carries a high incidence rate of the global malaria burden with about 233 million cases and 580,000 deaths.\n\nSpeaking on WMD, which is celebrated on April 25 every year, the WHO decried the standstill in the progress made in reducing the malaria burden globally.\n\nThis year's theme, \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world\" seeks to reach the 2030 malaria reduction target through the application of \"equity-oriented, gender-responsive and human-rights-based approaches.\"\n\nAlso speaking on the WMD, the professor of Biochemical Pharmacology called for the adoption of preventive measures and proper diagnosis and treatment of malaria to reduce the onset of anti-malaria resistance.", "source": {"uri":

Worldwide, one child dies of malaria every minute. Of the 608,000 people who will die from malaria in 2022, 95 per cent (!) will be in sub-Saharan Africa, and most will be children under the age of five. That is why we are using World Malaria Day on 25 April to once again raise awareness of this deadly disease.\n\nMalaria is on the rise around the world again. There are many reasons for this, including climate change: more (and more devastating) rainfall and flooding with rising temperatures - ideal conditions for the mosquitoes that transmit the disease to humans. In addition, these mosquitoes are now often resistant to insecticides, including those used to impregnate protective nets.\n\nBut there is also news that gives hope: According to a report in the \"Neuen Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung\", a promising new vaccine is within reach. It is a further development of the vaccine Mosquirix, which is already in use. According to a study published in The Lancet, the new vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, is 79 percent effective. By comparison, the effectiveness of Mosquirix is estimated at 56 percent. This rate only increases when the vaccine is administered more frequently.\n\nPregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. 20 per cent of stillbirths in sub-Saharan Africa are caused by malaria, as pregnancy reduces immunity to malaria and increases the risk of infection. The Gavi Immunisation Alliance and the Global Fund are committed to fighting malaria. They promote prevention through bed nets and testing, and the development of vaccines for people in the regions that need them most.\n\nNo single component will be the silver bullet in the fight against malaria: In addition to the vaccine, diagnostics, other (prophylactic) drugs and other tools such as insecticides need to be developed. Pregnant and women who are breastfeeding, in particular, should be much more visible as a risk group in future research and should be more closely involved in the research process, for example in clinical trials.\n\nAccording to the Global Fund, it distributed around 220 million mosquito nets and tested 321 million people for malaria infection in 2022 alone. In addition, 166 million malaria cases were treated. According to Gavi, it will also distribute 18 million vaccine doses between 2023 and 2025 to a total of 12 countries where the risk of malaria is highest. The Vaccine Alliance estimates the number of doses required at 40 to 60 million doses - with a strong upward trend (up to 100 million doses by 2030).\n\nIn view of these figures, it is essential that Germany, in particular, continues to support its partner countries in the Global South and does not abandon them. Cutting the budget of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development by a billion euro is therefore clearly the wrong decision. On the contrary, sufficient funding is essential to ensure that Gavi and the Global Fund can continue to fulfil their tasks. Cuts in this area cost more than money.

The infection remains a major burden and global health challenge, especially in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. Therefore proactive steps and efforts should be to control and eliminate malaria. However, numerous obstacles hinder equitable access to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. On World Malaria Day, expert shares the challenges involved in involved malaria control programs.\n\nDr Ravi N Sangapur, MD (Internal Medicine), Consultant Physician, HCG Suchirayu Hospital, Hubli told News9, \"Barriers to effective malaria control programs include limited resources, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, geographic isolation, and socioeconomic disparities. Overcoming these challenges requires a multifaceted approach that addresses systemic issues while leveraging innovations in technology, community engagement, and policy. By breaking down barriers to access and strengthening collaborative efforts, we can make substantial strides towards achieving malaria eradication and ensuring equitable healthcare for all populations affected by this disease.\"\n\nLimited Healthcare Infrastructure: One of the primary barriers to accessing malaria control programs is the limited healthcare infrastructure in many affected regions. Insufficient healthcare facilities, lack of trained healthcare professionals, and inadequate diagnostic tools hinder the effective identification, treatment, and prevention of malaria. Addressing this barrier requires investments in infrastructure development, capacity building, and resource allocation.\n\nInadequate Funding: Insufficient funding remains a significant obstacle in implementing comprehensive malaria control programs. Limited financial resources restrict the availability of essential medications, diagnostic tools, insecticide-treated bed nets, and other necessary interventions. International organisations, governments, and donors must prioritise funding for malaria control initiatives to ensure sustainable progress.\n\nGeographic Challenges: The geographical complexity of malaria-endemic regions poses unique obstacles to access. Remote and hard-to-reach areas lack adequate transportation infrastructure, making it difficult for healthcare workers to reach affected communities. Innovative approaches, such as distributing nets and conducting residual spraying using drones, can help reduce mosquito breeding sites and ensure timely access to malaria control interventions.\n\nSocio-cultural Factors: Socio-cultural factors, including beliefs, traditions, and gender inequalities, can significantly impact access to malaria control programs. Cultural practices and misconceptions about the disease may lead to low uptake of preventive measures or delay in seeking appropriate treatment. Engaging local communities, promoting health education, and fostering community-based interventions can help overcome these socio-cultural barriers.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sneha_kumari@news9live.com", "name": "Sneha Kumari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomic status"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Untitled-design-39.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The \u00a37.4 million support for MedAccess will be used to negotiate lower prices for vital malaria drugs and diagnostic tests for people in countries affected by the disease.\n\nThe funding brings total UK support to MedAccess to \u00a317.4 million, which will help one million people access new diagnostic tests and 120 million patients to receive anti-malarial treatments.\n\nMedAccess guarantees sales volumes of drugs in markets where demand is uncertain so manufacturers can commit to affordable prices and stable supply. In return, manufacturers receive assurance that they will be paid even if the demand doesn't materialise.\n\nIn three years, it is expected that more than 50 million people will have access to drugs and other items.\n\nThe announcement comes on the World Health Organisation's World Malaria Day, which aims to keep the disease high on the political agenda, mobilize additional resources, and empower communities.\n\nDeputy Foreign Secretary and Minister for Development and Africa, Andrew Mitchell, said:\n\nThanks to British science, we now have life-saving malaria vaccines which will protect millions of people.\n\nBut we also need to make sure we are making drugs available at the best possible price to the countries that most need them. Deaths from malaria are entirely preventable and the UK's support for MedAccess will ensure that countries can afford to offer people the best protection against the disease.\n\nIt has also been announced that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Benin will begin their first roll out of the UK-Indian developed RTS,S vaccine, marking a significant milestone in ending malaria.\n\nCollaboration between British scientists and Indian manufacturers resulted in two essential malaria vaccines being developed - RTS,S and R21. These have been used in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, with two million children vaccinated since 2019, and, in January, Cameroon became the first country to give the vaccines to children routinely.\n\nA total of 22 countries are due to roll out the vaccine. Gavi, which is funded by the UK, is aiming to immunise more than six million children from malaria by the end of 2025.\n\nUK funding helps MedAccess to reduce the costs of a range of innovative health products for HIV, TB and malaria, meaning that UK support for organisation like Gavi and the Global Fund will go further as they benefit from lower prices for products.\n\nChief Executive Officer for MedAccess, Michael Anderson, said:\n\nWe are deeply grateful for FCDO's continued support, which enables MedAccess to improve access to products for HIV, TB, and malaria in support of Global Fund programmes.\n\nMedAccess will continue to use innovative financial tools to reduce the cost of diagnosis, prevention and treatment, improving value for money while improving patient access. We are glad to announce this renewed funding on World Malaria Day, an important moment for global stakeholders to come together with a common ambition to accelerate malaria prevention and control.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe UK is a leading investor in the fight against malaria and the third largest historical donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, investing \u00a35.5 billion to date. Our current \u00a31 billion commitment to the Global Fund (2023/24 to 2025/26) will support distributing 86 million mosquito nets, provide 452,000 seasonal malaria chemoprevention treatments and providing malaria treatment and care for 18 million people.The UK is the largest sovereign donor to the core immunisation programme of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is currently supporting the roll-out the RTS,S malaria. A total of 22 countries are approved to roll out the vaccine.The UK is a leading donor and the largest donor of flexible voluntary contributions to WHO which plays a critical role in setting the norms and standards for health including malaria, as well as supporting countries with technical assistance. /Public Release.

About five million cases were recorded in 2016, but just over 600,000 were registered last year.\n\nThe numbers speak volumes; a reduction of severe malaria cases by 90%, a decline in malaria-related deaths by 91%, and an increase in Community Health Workers (CHWs) managing malaria cases from 18% to 60%. The statistics are not just figures in a report; they represent lives saved, families protected, and communities strengthened.\n\nThe journey towards a malaria-free Rwanda has been marked by concerted efforts and innovative strategies. From the deployment of CHWs to the distribution of Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) and the introduction of larviciding using drones, Rwanda has embraced a multifaceted approach that targets every aspect of malaria prevention and control.\n\nCentral to Rwanda's success has been its adaptability and commitment to evidence-based strategies. Recognizing the challenge of mosquito resistance to insecticides and pesticides, the decision to rotate between different products since 2017 demonstrates a proactive approach that is both responsive and effective.\n\nInitiatives like integrated vector management and community mobilization have also empowered local communities to take ownership of malaria prevention efforts.\n\nRwanda's ambition to be malaria-free aligns perfectly with the 2016-2030 global targets set by the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate the disease in 35 countries and reduce malaria morbidity and mortality rates by 90%. With a clear roadmap in place and the dedication of healthcare professionals, policymakers, and community leaders, this goal is within reach.\n\nALSO READ: Rwanda records 60% reduction in malaria deaths\n\nAs the country cements its place in healthcare governance, it is no surprise that it is hosting the 8th Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) Society Conference from April 21 to 27.

Mostly found in tropical countries, malaria can be a life-threatening disease that spreads to humans by some types of mosquitoes - to be specific, infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The infection is caused by a plasmodium parasite and does not spread from person to person.\n\nWhile malaria is completely curable, timely diagnosis and treatment is very much essential. Malaria can also become complicated, and even turn fatal. According to the World Health Organization website, \"globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608,000 malaria deaths in 85 countries.\" While a large number of these cases emerge from the African region, malaria is also not uncommon in India, a tropical nation.\n\nDr Seema Dhir, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Artemis Hospital Gurugram, shares the difference between complicated and uncomplicated malaria and how the treatment differs in both cases. \"Uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria differ in terms of levels of severity and accordingly, their treatments also vary. It is important to understand the differences between the two for effective management and treatment of malaria.\"\n\nUncomplicated malaria is the typical presentation of the disease, and the common symptoms include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and vomiting, says Dr Dhir. She adds, \"Although these symptoms can sometimes prove to debilitating, they do not indicate the presence of severe complications. These types of uncomplicated malaria can generally be managed on an outpatient basis, and the prognosis is generally good with immediate and effective treatment,\" adds Dr Dhir.\n\nThe treatment of uncomplicated malaria typically involves the use of antimalarial medications, which target the Plasmodium parasites that cause infection, according to Dr Dhir. \"The choice of antimalarial medication depends on various factors, like the species of Plasmodium involved and the drug resistance patterns in the region where the infection was acquired,\" the doctor adds. Commonly used antimalarial drugs include:\n\n1. Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs): For uncomplicated malaria, in several regions where the disease is endemic, ACTs are considered to be the first-line treatment. These combination therapies generally include an artemisinin derivative, which instantly reduces the parasite load. They are combined with a longer-acting partner drug that helps clear the remaining parasites.\n\n2. Chloroquine: In areas where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is susceptible to chloroquine, this drug is generally used as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases.\n\n3. Other antimalarial medications: In places where people show resistance to artemisinin or other antimalarial drugs, other medications like mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil, or quinine may be used for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.\n\nThe doctor highlights the fact that the duration of treatment and specific dosing regimens vary depending on the medication used and the severity of the infection. \"Apart from antimalarial drugs, supportive care measures like rest, hydration, and symptomatic relief of fever and pain may be recommended to help alleviate symptoms and promote recovery,\" says Dr Dhir.\n\nIf the malaria is severe, then it is a medical emergency that requires urgent intervention, says Dr Dhir, failing which there can be life-threatening complications. \"Symptoms of severe malaria may include impaired consciousness, seizures, respiratory distress, severe anaemia, jaundice, renal failure, and circulatory collapse. If not treated immediately, severe malaria can progress to multiple organ failure and death at a very fast pace.\"\n\nRigorous management to address both the underlying infection as well as associated complications is key in the treatment of severe malaria. Dr Seema Dhir breaks down the key components of the treatment:\n\n1. Intravenous Antimalarial Therapy: Oral medications may not be sufficient if a patient has severe malaria because of impaired absorption or inability to tolerate oral intake, says Dr Dhir. She adds that therefore, intravenous (IV) administration of antimalarial drugs like artesunate or quinine is generally recommended as the first-line treatment.\n\n2. Supportive Care: Patients with severe malaria require intensive supportive care to manage complications and maintain vital organ function. \"This generally includes measures like fluid resuscitation, oxygen therapy, blood transfusion for severe anaemia, and management of electrolyte imbalances,\" says Dr Dhir.\n\n3. Monitoring And Close Observation: \"Patients with severe malaria need to be closely monitored for signs of clinical deterioration, including changes in consciousness, respiratory distress, and hemodynamic instability,\" says Dr Dhir. She adds that time-to-time clinical assessments, laboratory testing, and vital sign monitoring are necessary to guide treatment decisions and optimize patient outcomes.\n\n4.

This disease is quite common in tropical and subtropical countries. The common symptoms of Malaria include shaking, chills and high fever. However, this disease can be prevented with proper precautions and some preventive measures.\n\nEvery year, the world celebrates World Malaria Day on April 25, 2024, to raise awareness about the preventive measures against Malaria and what we can do to ensure that we don't fall prey to the disease. On World Malaria Day, let's understand the history and significance of this day apart from theme.\n\nHistory\n\nAfrican governments have been celebrating Africa's Malaria Day since 2001 which was changed to World Malaria Day at the World Health Assembly's 60th session sponsored by the World Health Organisation (WHO). They decided that the world needs to be more aware and cautious about preventive measures against Malaria and mosquito bites. This is how this day came into being.\n\nSignificance\n\nWorld Malaria Day urges people to come together to prevent the spread of this disease. This is a platform for international partners, foundations and companies showing their efforts in eradicating this disease and contributing to getting a better healthcare structure.\n\nTheme\n\n\"On this World Malaria Day 2024, we unite under the theme \u2011 Accelerating the fight against malaria for more equitable world. This theme, which is in sync with this year's World Health Day theme - My Health, My Right, underscores the urgent need to address the stark inequities that persist in access to malaria prevention, detection, and treatment services,\" stated Saima Wazed, WHO Regional Director for South-East Asia on the official website of World Health Organisation.\n\nSymptoms of Malaria\n\nThe first symptoms usually begin within 10-15 days after the bite from a mosquito. The common symptoms include Fever, headache and chills, which may be mild and difficult to recognise. However, in malaria endemic areas, people who have developed partial immunity may not experience such symptoms.\n\nTreatment for Malaria\n\nMalaria is a curable disease and it can be treated through early diagnosis. The most common medications that are used for the treatment of malaria are Quinine, Doxycycline, Chloroquine, Artemisinin, Mefloquine and Atovaquone.\n\nIndia Malaria Programme\n\nThe India Malaria Control Program, now the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), has evolved since the 1950s. Initially focusing on DDT spraying, it shifted to comprehensive strategies like bed nets, ACTs, and RDTs. Successes include reduced cases and deaths, especially in high-risk states like Odisha. Challenges include drug resistance and remote-area transmission. Key strategies for success are vector control, early diagnosis with ACTs, robust surveillance, and community engagement. Despite progress, ongoing efforts and innovation are needed to meet the goal of malaria elimination by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "ommcomnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ommcom News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefloquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mefloquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artemisinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxycycline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doxycycline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chloroquine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vector control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://ommcomnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/world-malaria-day.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But across the African continent malaria has never left, killing or sickening millions of people.Take Funmilayo Kotun, a 66-year-old resident of Makoko, an informal neighborhood in Nigeria's Lagos city. Its ponds of dirty water provide favorable breeding conditions for malaria-spreading mosquitoes. Kotun can't afford insecticide-treated bed nets that cost between $7 and $21 each, much less antimalarial medications or treatment.For World Malaria Day on Thursday, here is what you need to know about the situation in Africa:MALARIA IS STILL WIDESPREADThe malaria parasite mostly spreads to people via infected mosquitoes and can cause symptoms including fever, headaches and chills. It mostly affects children under 5 and pregnant women. Vaccine efforts are still in early stages: Cameroon this year became the first country to routinely give children a new malaria vaccine, which is only about 30% effective and doesn't stop transmission. A second vaccine was recently approved.Cases of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides are increasing, while funding by governments and donors for innovation is slowing.Living conditions play a role, with crowded neighborhoods, stagnant water, poor sanitation and lack of access to treatment and prevention materials all issues in many areas. And an invasive species of mosquito previously seen mostly in India and the Persian Gulf is a new concern.A GROWING PROBLEMGlobally, malaria cases are on the rise.

In 1951, the United States eliminated malaria in our country. And with strong bipartisan support in Congress, we've led the fight to eliminate this disease worldwide-saving nearly 12 million lives and preventing more than two billion infections since 2000.\n\nBut despite this progress, nearly half the global population remains vulnerable to malaria-living in constant fear that they will lose their lives because of a mosquito bite. And last year, after two decades of no domestically-acquired cases of malaria, ten cases were reported in the United States. While the individuals were successfully treated, and the spread was halted, it was a solemn reminder of the urgent need to continue preventing and treating the disease globally.\n\nThat is exactly what my Administration is doing. We've expanded the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative, and are now partnering with 30 countries to bring life-saving tools and treatments to people in need. We also hosted the seventh replenishment for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, raising a historically high level of funding from global donors. And, the United States has been a driving force behind deployment of the first-ever malaria vaccine. When combined with other prevention tools-such as mosquito nets and preventive medicines-these vaccines have the potential to save millions of children's lives around the world.\n\nTo all those living in fear of malaria: the United States sees you.

World Malaria Day is observed annually on April 25, to spread awareness about the mosquito-borne disease. This year's theme is \"accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,\" as many people globally have no access to quality, timely treatment, and affordable services to prevent, detect, and treat malaria.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2022, malaria claimed the lives of an estimated 608,000 people worldwide and there were 249 million new cases.\n\nA 2022 Lancet study on malaria showed that an increase in temperatures could also enable the malaria parasite to develop faster and therefore escalate the transmission and burden of malaria. Even just a 2-3 degree Celsius increase could increase the population vulnerable to the disease by 5 per cent, equating to 700 million more people.\n\nAlso Read: World Malaria Day: WHO Calls For Equitable Health Access\n\nDr Manish Mittal, Consultant Physician, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, told IANS,\n\nClimate shifts play a pivotal role in altering the transmission patterns of malaria, particularly during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons from June to November. Fresh rainfall leads to waterlogging and the accumulation of stagnant water, creating ideal breeding grounds for the female Anopheles mosquito, the carrier of malaria parasites. This period witnessed a surge in malaria cases due to increased mosquito breeding in these water bodies.\n\n\"Early diagnosis and treatment are paramount in mitigating the impact of malaria, with heightened awareness prompting individuals to seek medical attention for fever symptoms and undergo simple blood tests,\" he added.\n\nIn a new study, researchers at the University of Florida showed that various mosquito and parasite traits exhibit intermittent relationships with temperature and that under future warming temperatures, transmission potential is likely to increase in some environments but could reduce in others.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature Communications, also suggests that parasites can develop more quickly at cooler temperatures and that the rate of parasite development might be less sensitive to changes in temperature than previously thought.\n\nDr Rajeev Boudhankar, Medical Director, Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, told IANS,\n\nThe primary solution lies in avoiding construction sites and ensuring stagnant water is promptly cleared, especially at construction sites. Additionally, households should discard items that collect water, such as pots and old tires, and cover themselves while travelling.\n\nDr Manish also emphasised employing personal protection methods such as insect repellents and mosquito nets.\n\nAlso Read: Second Malaria Vaccine Gets WHO Approval: 5 Things To Know\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nNDTV - Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via the Banega Swachh India initiative, which in its Season 10 is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Ayushmann Khurrana. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future - Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone's health in India - especially vulnerable communities - the LGBTQ population, indigenous people, India's different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In a world post COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition, mental well-being, self-care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival - climate change. It has now been described as a \"code red for humanity.\" The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution, waste management, plastic ban, manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene. Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat, the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.", "source": {"uri":

This year's celebration is themed, 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world,' according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nFindings by our correspondent showed that the prices of some antimalarial drugs have increased from 12 per cent to 23 per cent from November 2023 to April 2024.\n\nIn November, an Artesunate injection of 120mg was sold for N2,500, while the 60mg of the injection was sold for N1,800.\n\nCoartem 80/480 was N3, 300, while Amatem soft gel was sold for N2,500, and Lonart 80/480mg, for N2,850.\n\nHowever, in April, market surveys showed that Artesunate 120mg now sells for N2,800, while 60mg of the injection now sells for N2,000. Coartem 80/480 is now sold for N4,000. Amatem soft gel, N3, 000; and Lonart 80/480mg for N3, 500.\n\nA school teacher, Amina Yusuf lamented that the hike in antimalarial drugs has become unbearable and there is a need for the government to urgently intervene.\n\n\"They keep telling us that we should not use concoctions to treat ourselves, yet we can't afford the drugs at the pharmacies.\n\n\"Malaria is common in Nigeria, hence the need for the government to intervene. The high prices of drugs have become unbearable, and my take-home pay at the end of the month is not enough,\" Yusuf said.\n\nMr Akin Ojo said he resorted to taking herbal medicines when he was diagnosed with malaria because he could not afford antimalarial drugs at the pharmacy.\n\n\"When taking those medications, you have to eat well. They will still tell you to buy paradol or paracetamol, and by the time you calculate everything, you will see that people like us can't afford it,\" he lamented.\n\nIn 2023, the former Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire said an estimated 55 million cases of malaria and nearly 90,000 malaria deaths occur each year in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the economic burden of malaria in Nigeria was estimated at $1.6b (N687bn) in 2022 and may increase to about $2.8bn (N2tn) in 2030.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, the National Chairman of the Association of Community Pharmacists in Nigeria, Adewale Oladigbolu, said the government needs to invest adequately in the health sector to reduce the prices of drugs in the country.\n\n\"Patients are not meant to have a problem with the prices of drugs if the health insurance is working in Nigeria. The government needs to invest so we can make Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients because many of the antimalarial drugs are imported.\n\n\"For those that are locally made, they have to improve the APIs, and they are subject to changes in exchange rates.\n\n\"If the government invests in the sector and partners with the private sector, that will help in the reduction of antimalarial drugs. Nigeria is probably the country that has the highest antimalarial consumption rate in the whole world,\" he said.\n\nThe African Region carries a high proportion of the global malaria burden, accounting for about 95 per cent of all malaria cases and 96 per cent of all malaria deaths in 2021, according to WHO.\n\nWHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti said, \"While Nigeria accounts for around 27 per cent of the global burden of malaria cases, the country has seen major progress.\n\n\"Malaria incidence has fallen by 26 per cent since 2000, from 413 per 1000 to 302 per 1000 in 2021. Malaria deaths also fell by 55 per cent, from 2.1 per 1000 population to 0.9 per 1000 population.\n\n\"Drivers of this continuing disease burden include the size of Nigeria's population, making scaling up intervention challenging; suboptimal surveillance systems, which pick up less than 40 per cent of the country's malaria data; inadequate funding to ensure universal interventions across all states; and health-seeking behaviour, where people use the private sector, with limited regulation, preferentially.\"\n\nMeanwhile, WHO said malaria remains a serious global health challenge that takes its heaviest toll on the most vulnerable.\n\nIt stated that young children living in the poorest households in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by the disease.\n\n\"Pregnant women, refugees, migrants, internally displaced people, and Indigenous Peoples are among the other groups at higher risk of contracting malaria.\n\n\"Too many people continue to miss out on the services and information they need to prevent, detect and treat malaria, especially those experiencing disadvantage, discrimination and exclusion,\" it said.\n\nThe WHO noted that there is a need to strengthen and step up support for these populations, stressing that it is the best way to get back on track to achieve the global malaria targets.", "source": {"uri": "healthwise.punchng.com",

20.1 percent in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday.\n\nThe UN health agency said the gain was made in the most affected areas by adopting an integrated disease response with support from the WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and donors.\n\nSomalia's malaria program reduced disease incidence to as low as 3.4 percent in 2022 by applying prevention, interruption and supplementary measures, as documented by the country's National Malaria Control Program.\n\nHowever, the effects of the nation's drought and floods contributed to a minor increase in incidence in 2023, to 4 percent, according to the WHO.\n\n\"Detection of new malaria strains, compounded by persistent insecurity and health impacts of climate change, may exacerbate the malaria situation in the country,\" Jamal Amran, WHO Somalia's focal person for malaria control, said in a statement issued in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.\n\nA historic drought affected Somalia from 2022 to 2023, and the country has since been hit by heavy rainfalls due to the El Nino phenomenon, according to the WHO.\n\nSuch rapid changes to climate, including temperature, rainfall patterns and humidity, could easily lead to further geographic expansion of malaria transmission or new variation, it said.\n\nDuring 2023, Somalia increasingly detected a new strain of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which is hard to detect with the usual rapid diagnostic test, as well as a new urban invasive vector for malaria, the mosquito Anopheles stephensi, in several districts, the WHO said.\n\nThe country also has a large number of people on the move, including nomadic communities, internally displaced people, and people arriving from neighboring countries Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen.\n\n\"This tends to increase the disease prevalence, including malaria, owing to contributing factors such as overcrowded environments, limited access to health care, and lack of awareness,\" the WHO said.",

Despite several exciting advances, efforts to tackle the parasitic pathogen have stalled since 2015: then, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 586,000 people died from the disease; in 2022, it killed 608,000.\n\n\"It really does seem like a Red Queen scenario, we do an awful lot of running [to] make small steps forward,\" says Prof Chris Drakeley, a professor of infection and immunity at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThat's because both the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes which spread it are wily opponents, constantly evolving to evade efforts to wipe out the disease. \"Any organism, when you put pressure on it, will change,\" Prof Drakeley says. \"I think the challenge at the moment is really: how do we deal with these changes?\"\n\nThree biological threats are of particular concern to experts grappling to eradicate malaria: stealth parasites, super mosquitoes, and mounting resistance.\n\n\"Right now we are in this sort of turning point moment, where it could go either way,\" says Prof Olivo Miotto, a malaria genomics expert at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok.\n\nStealth parasites\n\nThe first issue affects diagnostics. In 2010, researchers in the Peruvian Amazon detected an unusual mutation: some parasites no longer had HRP2 proteins, which many lateral flow tests use to detect malaria. This meant cases could be missed, giving the disease - and the genetic quirk - space to circulate.\n\nSince then, the deletion has spread across continents. While prevalence estimates vary, a concerning hotspot has emerged in the Horn of Africa - some studies have suggested as many as 80 per cent of asymptomatic cases in Djibouti and Eritrea have could not be picked up by rapid diagnostics reliant on the HRP2 and HRP2 protein. In 2022, according to the WHO, 415.5 million such tests were sold worldwide.\n\n\"There's a different antigen [test] to pick this up, but it's not as well researched and developed,\" says Dr Stephen Woolley, an honorary clinical researcher and malaria specialist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \"WHO is trying to validate these newer tests... but I think this could be a really big challenge to global health and malaria control.\n\n\"We're seeing that in the Horn of Africa, and it's now spreading to Kenya and Uganda,\" he says, adding that doctors have also identified the issue in clinics in Britain. Earlier this week, the UK Health Security Agency said the number of malaria cases diagnosed here among travellers exceeded 2,000 for the first time since 2001.\n\nBut the deletion does not mean the malaria parasite is \"under an invisibility cloak\", says Prof Drakeley, as cases can still be diagnosed in the laboratory. He is optimistic that the issue - which affects only a tiny proportion of global malaria infections - can be contained, and that newer rapid diagnostics to solve it are on the horizon.\n\nSuper mosquitoes\n\nSuper mosquitoes have also emerged and appear to be driving an unexpected surge in malaria across the Horn of Africa. Combined with the changing parasite, the impact could be terrible.\n\n\"The genotype of the parasite, mixed with Anopheles stephensi [mosquito]... is a recipe for disaster potentially in Africa, and could make elimination extremely difficult,\" says Dr Woolley.\n\nUnlike the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, the most widespread carrier of malaria, the highly adaptable Anopheles stephensi thrives in urban areas and breeds almost anywhere - in a dirty puddle between slum shacks, a rubbish dump, or even water in an abandoned car tyre.\n\nIt also survives in high temperatures in dry seasons, when malaria transmission usually lulls.\n\nNative to parts of Asia and the Arabian peninsula, its arrival in Africa has triggered concerns that the burden of disease could shift from rural to urban areas. It was first spotted in Djibouti in 2012, and was a key driver of a 2,800 per cent surge over the next eight years.\n\nIt has since spread to countries including Ethiopia, Somalia and Nigeria, while the WHO has described it as a \"threat to malaria control and elimination\", especially in African megacities.\n\n\"There's clearly a concern around the arrival of the anopheles stephensi in Africa and the impact of that is still, in my view, extremely uncertain,\" says Prof Nick White, a professor at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, who specialises in malaria.\n\n\"It's a worry because we have an increasing change in the demography in Africa, with a move from rural areas to cities. It follows that a city-dwelling mosquito would do quite well - but it's not a fantastic vector.\"\n\nBut with the stephensi, \"it feels like for once we are above the curve\", says Dr Jackie Cook, co-director of the Malaria Centre at the LSHTM. The vector was detected early, surveillance networks have been established, and vector control efforts are ramping up.\n\nResistance\n\nThe same cannot be said for drug and insecticide resistance, which have repeatedly emerged.\n\n\"We're a little bit slow at having new things coming through the pipeline, we never seem to be ahead of the curve,\" she warns. \"We're always waiting for something bad to happen, and then we react to it.\"\n\nThere are two forms of resistance: resistance among mosquitoes to insecticides, and resistance among parasites to antimalarial drugs.\n\nIn the WHO's latest malaria report, published in November, the agency warned that 87 per cent of countries have reported some resistance to pyrethroid-based insecticides, 82 per cent to organochlorines, 69 per cent of carbamates, and 60 per cent to organophosphates.\n\nThis problem has not emerged overnight - reduced efficacy of pyrethroid, which is used on bednets, was first noticed more than a decade ago. While there have been efforts to rotate or mix insecticides, it was not until last year that the WHO updated its recommendations to also use chlorfenapyr - the first insecticide in some 40 years, which grounds mosquitoes by causing their wings to spasm.\n\nThis has proven to be incredibly effective: a study earlier this month found that the rollout of the potent insecticide has prevented at least 13 million cases in Africa.\n\nDr Cook says the new insecticide coated bednets are \"fantastic\", but is concerned they will lull us into a false sense of security.\n\n\"It feels like we're all piling on chlorfenapyr - lots of companies are pivoting because it's been shown to be more effective, which creates more competition and brings prices down. But what's next? Will we find ourselves in the same situation 10 years down the line? There doesn't seem to be much else coming through the pipeline.\n\n\"We're spending all this money monitoring the situation, but we should have put a lot of that money into developing the new tools,\" Dr Cook adds. \"I think we've done things badly in terms of insecticide resistance. The concern is we do the same with drug resistance as well.\"\n\nThis would be a major blow. At the moment, doctors are predominantly reliant on artemisinin-based treatments to tackle malaria - between 2010 and 2022, more than four billion courses were delivered to clinics by manufacturers.\n\nCurrently, the WHO describes the status as \"partial resistance\" - drugs still work, just more slowly. But the issue is spreading, having jumped from the Greater Mekong Region where it was first noted, to Africa.\n\n\"We rely entirely on artemisinin combination treatments, of which there are over half a billion treatments given each year,\" says Prof White. \"If we lose these, we're in serious trouble - because despite all the large investments in antimalarial drug discovery in the past 20 years, we've been rather unsuccessful.\n\n\"There are new drugs that could save us - candidates from Novartis look most promising - but they are still three to five years away,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that efforts are underway to reduce the rise of resistance - such as using two other drugs alongside artemisinin, not just one, and encouraging people to finish their course. But this is likely only \"sticking a plaster\" on the issue - at some point, full resistance will spread.\n\nSlither of light - and age-old issues\n\nOf course, it's not all doom and gloom, and there have been huge steps forward in efforts to eradicate malaria.\n\nMost significant is the rollout of two new malaria vaccines: in July 2022 GSK's RTS,S shot, also known as Mosquirix, was approved, followed by Oxford University's R21 immunisation in December. Experts say these shots, which are around 75 per cent effective at preventing the disease in areas where transmission is seasonal, could save tens of thousands of children's lives every year.\n\n\"The vaccine is the latest 'shiny thing' for humans, but alone it's not going to end malaria transmission,\" says Prof Drakeley. \"But it will save lives... it's a nine per cent reduction in all cause mortality in children, that's massively impressive.\"\n\nOther exciting tools - from gene drive mosquitoes to spatial repellents for homes and buildings - are also emerging, with researchers describing it as an \"exciting time\" to be in the malaria field.\n\nCountries are also containing the disease: in 2023, Azerbaijan, Belize and Tajikistan all eliminated the parasitic pathogen, joining 40 other countries certified as malaria-free, while regions like southeast Asia - where the disease once thrived - now have minimal infections.\n\nYet there are concerns that the funding needed to replicate these successes is dwindling - according to analysis from Malaria No More and the Oxford Economics Group, the proportion of global research and development funding dedicated to malaria has fallen from $707m in 2019 to $604m in 2022.\n\n\"Governments, research institutions and funding organisations must keep their foot on the accelerator to continue fostering novel interventions and treatments to maintain a robust malaria pipeline for the future,\" says Gareth Jenkins, an executive director at Malaria No More UK. \"If we don't, this disease can thrive again.\"\n\nThere are other \"not very politically digestible\" issues too, says Prof White, \"such as incompetence, corruption, fabrication of data, wrong results - all those sorts of things that no one ever talks about, but are actually quite important\".\n\nAnd then there are the broader societal issues - including climate change, extreme weather events, conflict and mass migration - that could derail eradication efforts, providing opportunities for malaria to thrive and new obstacles to deliver services.\n\n\"The playground for this disease is basically social circumstances - it's poverty, lack of resources, lack of accessibility to the really basic health services,\" says Prof Miotto. \"And in that sense, the failure of rapid tests or partial artemisinin resistance makes little difference if you don't have any rapid tests, and you don't have any drugs. We can't lose sight of the basics.\"\n\nProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

During the deadly Khmer Rouge regime in the mid-1970s, he saved countless lives by dispensing malaria medication from his pockets. In the decades after the war, he helped rebuild the country's shattered malaria control programme from scratch.\n\nToday, as Cambodia approaches malaria elimination, Chheang is finally getting the recognition he deserves: In December, he received the \"Unsung Hero\" award at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai for the sacrifices he made in efforts to eliminate this deadly infectious disease.\n\n\"A life of unwavering service to preventing illness and saving lives is an exceptional career worthy of recognition in and of itself,\" Dr David Walton, the US Global Malaria Coordinator at the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), wrote in a recent letter to Chheang. \"To do so through the terror and suffering of the Khmer Rouge regime and to rebuild in its wake is truly heroic.\"\n\nChheang, a soft-spoken man with wire-rimmed glasses and a razor-sharp memory, has remained humble through it all. One recent muggy afternoon while sipping coconut water in his Phnom Penh apartment, the retired entomologist quietly recounted the horrors and blessings of the seven decades he spent on the front lines of the war on malaria.\n\nCambodia's Historic Milestone\n\nFor decades, malaria has ranked as one of the most common causes of illness and death in Cambodia, where many of the country's 17 million residents live and work in rural villages surrounded by dense forests that also are home to malaria-carrying mosquitoes.\n\nBut recently, Cambodia has reached an incredible milestone: Not a single malaria death has been recorded in more than six years, and the total number of infection cases in 2023 decreased by two-thirds from the previous year. Suddenly, the dream of eliminating malaria in Cambodia is a real possibility.\n\nNo one person or programme can take full credit for the turnaround; but together, the Cambodian government; the US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), led by USAID and co-implemented with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria have accomplished a great deal. Chheang helped lead control efforts from the very beginning.\n\nChheang was born in a rural commune in Kampong Thom Province, where he lived with his parents and four siblings, all of whom would later die in the Khmer Rouge genocide. From a young age, Chheang had a fascination with insects. But it wasn't until age 17, when a French entomologist at the Institut de Biologie took him under his wing and trained him in vector control, that he decided on his future career path.\n\n\"I was fascinated with insects, especially the mosquito which could deliver this powerful disease from its bite,\" Chheang said through an interpreter. \"I am forever grateful to (him) for recognising my interest and training me.\"\n\nIn 1960, during the rule of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chheang was sent to study in the Philippines. When he returned to Cambodia, he became a 23-year-old entomologist technician at the Ministry of Health's national malaria control programme. He helped initiate the first malaria eradication pilot project in Kratie province in the 1960s and held a number of senior roles in the malaria programme technical bureau when the Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975.\n\nSacrifice and Courage\n\nLike most Cambodians at the time, Chheang experienced horrific loss and sacrifice under the Khmer Rouge. His three brothers, sister, and mother were murdered. His wife and their 10-month-old son starved to death in a labour camp. Chheang was evacuated by foot to Preah Net Preah district in Banteay Meanchey province, but before leaving Phnom Penh he secretly stashed packets of antimalarial pills in his pockets.\n\nAt first Chheang tried to keep his pharmacy a secret, fearing retribution from the Khmer Rouge soldiers. But as more prisoners were cured of malaria, the soldiers took notice and demanded treatment for themselves.\n\nThen one day, a top regional military leader became sick and sent for Chheang.\n\n\"I was so scared and thought if anything went wrong, I would be killed right there in front of everyone,\" he said. Instead, the commander was cured and Chheang gained the respect of fellow prisoners and his captors alike. \"After this, they allowed me to move freely from home to home to treat sick people. Anyone with a fever was referred to me.\"\n\nWhile Chheang worked to save lives, Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge killed an estimated two million people from 1975 to 1979, including many doctors and other health professionals. Chheang also lost the majority of his colleagues from the malaria control programme.\n\n\"I survived the Khmer Rouge because of those malaria tablets. They were my blessing,\" he says.\n\nRebuilding\n\nAfter the war, Chheang was one of just five malaria workers remaining who returned to Phnom Penh to help restore the national malaria control programme - with no budget or staff - from ground zero. He also picked up other pieces of his life and married his late wife's younger sister, Nong Bunny, who was then a lab technician in the malaria programme.\n\nOne of his biggest accomplishments at the time, Chheang says, was organising training for 68 participants from 24 provinces to be able to test and treat malaria. Cambodia lacked healthcare providers, medical equipment and supplies, but Chheang convinced the World Health Organization (WHO) in Manila to provide tests, slides, microscopes, and drugs through UNICEF to help the national programme get its start.\n\nPartnering with PMI\n\nChheang spent many years working alongside USAID-supported PMI projects, including the Malaria Control in Cambodia, or MCC, project in western Cambodia. He would often travel to Pailin province near the Thailand border - a former Khmer Rouge stronghold and well-known epicentre of drug resistance and high-burden malaria cases. In Pailin, he led his team on foot for days or weeks through villages riddled with land mines. They took on grave personal risk to identify mosquitoes and their breeding sites, and to deliver treated nets to villagers living there.\n\nHe would also frequently encounter former Khmer Rouge fighters in the area who had surrendered to government forces and were granted amnesty. Chheang says he treated everyone needing help with the same compassion and respect, regardless of their past. \"If we don't help people with malaria, we cease to be humans.\"\n\nAn Inspiration to the Malaria Community\n\nChheang retired in 2016, but his contributions to the elimination of malaria and his work with the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control won't soon be forgotten. Cambodia would not be where it is today without the hard work and dedication of disease control pioneers like Yeang Chheang.\n\n\"Your success is an inspiration to me, my colleagues at the US President's Malaria Initiative, and all of the malaria community,\" Dr Walton wrote in his letter to Yeang Chheang. \"It is my greatest hope that we can achieve a world free of malaria through the same hard work, dedication, and perseverance.\"", "source": {"uri": "khmertimeskh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khmer Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Malaria remains a substantial public health concern, specifically in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where conditions are favourable for mosquito breeding. When it comes to pregnant women, malaria poses unique challenges, risks, and threats. Pregnant women are more likely to be susceptible to the illness due to their altered immune response, and the consequences can be severe for both the mother and the unborn child.\n\nThere are five types of parasites, but the most common and deadly in pregnancy are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. These parasites can cross the placenta and impact the foetal development, leading to complications. Understanding the risks and implementing preventive measures is essential for protecting the pregnant women and their babies from dangers of malaria. Malaria can have critical risks to the pregnant ladies and their child. Some of the major risks associated with malaria are:\n\n1. Anaemia: the malaria parasites infect red blood cells, leading to their destruction. Pregnant women with malaria are at a higher risk of developing anaemia, which can result in fatigue, weakness, and a higher chance of postpartum haemorrhage.\n\n2. Low birth weight and preterm delivery: Infections during pregnancy can reduce foetal growth, resulting in low birth weight. Malaria is also associated with higher risk of preterm delivery, potentially causing complications in the baby's early development.\n\n3. Miscarriage and Stillbirth: Malaria increases the risk of miscarriage, especially during the first trimester. In severe cases, it can also lead to stillbirth, where the baby is born without any signs of life.\n\n4. Congenital Malaria: Parasites can cross the placenta and infect the baby, leading to congenital malaria. This condition cause fever, irritability, and poor feeding in newborns.\n\nPreventing malaria during pregnancy is crucial for the health of both the mother and the baby. Some of the preventive measures that pregnant ladies can take and consider are:\n\n1. Use of Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs): Sleeping under ITNs is one of the most effective ways to prevent mosquito bites and reduce the risk of Malaria. Pregnant women should ensure their nets are in good condition and properly used.\n\n2. Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): This involves spraying insecticides on indoor walls to kill mosquitoes and reduce their population. IRS can significantly lower the risk of malaria transmission.\n\n3. Prophylactic Medication: In regions with high malaria transmission, pregnant women are often given antimalarial medication as a preventive measure. The specific drug and dosage depends on the local resistance patterns and trimesters of pregnancy.\n\n4. Avoidance of Mosquito-prone areas: Pregnant women should minimize exposure to areas with high mosquito activity, especially during peak biting times (dusk and dawn).\n\n5. Early detection and treatment: Pregnant women should seek medical attention if they experience malaria like symptoms. Early detection and appropriate treatment are critical to prevent complications.\n\nMalaria in pregnancy is a serious yet preventable concern. By adopting preventive measures and seeking early diagnosis, pregnant women can significantly reduce the risk of complications for themselves and their babies. Remember, knowledge and preventive measures are the best weapons in this fight.

Despite several exciting advances, efforts to tackle the parasitic pathogen have stalled since 2015: then, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 586,000 people died from the disease; in 2022, it killed 608,000.\n\n\"It really does seem like a Red Queen scenario, we do an awful lot of running [to] make small steps forward,\" says Prof Chris Drakeley, a professor of infection and immunity at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThat's because both the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes which spread it are wily opponents, constantly evolving to evade efforts to wipe out the disease. \"Any organism, when you put pressure on it, will change,\" Prof Drakeley says. \"I think the challenge at the moment is really: how do we deal with these changes?\"\n\nThree biological threats are of particular concern to experts grappling to eradicate malaria: stealth parasites, super mosquitoes, and mounting resistance.\n\n\"Right now we are in this sort of turning point moment, where it could go either way,\" says Prof Olivo Miotto, a malaria genomics expert at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok.\n\nStealth parasites\n\nThe first issue affects diagnostics. In 2010, researchers in the Peruvian Amazon detected an unusual mutation: some parasites no longer had HRP2 proteins, which many lateral flow tests use to detect malaria. This meant cases could be missed, giving the disease - and the genetic quirk - space to circulate.\n\nSince then, the deletion has spread across continents. While prevalence estimates vary, a concerning hotspot has emerged in the Horn of Africa - some studies have suggested as many as 80 per cent of asymptomatic cases in Djibouti and Eritrea have could not be picked up by rapid diagnostics reliant on the HRP2 and HRP2 protein. In 2022, according to the WHO, 415.5 million such tests were sold worldwide.\n\n\"There's a different antigen [test] to pick this up, but it's not as well researched and developed,\" says Dr Stephen Woolley, an honorary clinical researcher and malaria specialist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \"WHO is trying to validate these newer tests... but I think this could be a really big challenge to global health and malaria control.\n\n\"We're seeing that in the Horn of Africa, and it's now spreading to Kenya and Uganda,\" he says, adding that doctors have also identified the issue in clinics in Britain. Earlier this week, the UK Health Security Agency said the number of malaria cases diagnosed here among travellers exceeded 2,000 for the first time since 2001.\n\nBut the deletion does not mean the malaria parasite is \"under an invisibility cloak\", says Prof Drakeley, as cases can still be diagnosed in the laboratory. He is optimistic that the issue - which affects only a tiny proportion of global malaria infections - can be contained, and that newer rapid diagnostics to solve it are on the horizon.\n\nSuper mosquitoes\n\nSuper mosquitoes have also emerged and appear to be driving an unexpected surge in malaria across the Horn of Africa. Combined with the changing parasite, the impact could be terrible.\n\n\"The genotype of the parasite, mixed with Anopheles stephensi [mosquito]... is a recipe for disaster potentially in Africa, and could make elimination extremely difficult,\" says Dr Woolley.\n\nUnlike the Anopheles gambiae mosquito, the most widespread carrier of malaria, the highly adaptable Anopheles stephensi thrives in urban areas and breeds almost anywhere - in a dirty puddle between slum shacks, a rubbish dump, or even water in an abandoned car tyre.\n\nIt also survives in high temperatures in dry seasons, when malaria transmission usually lulls.\n\nNative to parts of Asia and the Arabian peninsula, its arrival in Africa has triggered concerns that the burden of disease could shift from rural to urban areas. It was first spotted in Djibouti in 2012, and was a key driver of a 2,800 per cent surge over the next eight years.\n\nIt has since spread to countries including Ethiopia, Somalia and Nigeria, while the WHO has described it as a \"threat to malaria control and elimination\", especially in African megacities.\n\n\"There's clearly a concern around the arrival of the anopheles stephensi in Africa and the impact of that is still, in my view, extremely uncertain,\" says Prof Nick White, a professor at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, who specialises in malaria.\n\n\"It's a worry because we have an increasing change in the demography in Africa, with a move from rural areas to cities. It follows that a city-dwelling mosquito would do quite well - but it's not a fantastic vector.\"\n\nBut with the stephensi, \"it feels like for once we are above the curve\", says Dr Jackie Cook, co-director of the Malaria Centre at the LSHTM. The vector was detected early, surveillance networks have been established, and vector control efforts are ramping up.\n\nResistance\n\nThe same cannot be said for drug and insecticide resistance, which have repeatedly emerged.\n\n\"We're a little bit slow at having new things coming through the pipeline, we never seem to be ahead of the curve,\" she warns. \"We're always waiting for something bad to happen, and then we react to it.\"\n\nThere are two forms of resistance: resistance among mosquitoes to insecticides, and resistance among parasites to antimalarial drugs.\n\nIn the WHO's latest malaria report, published in November, the agency warned that 87 per cent of countries have reported some resistance to pyrethroid-based insecticides, 82 per cent to organochlorines, 69 per cent of carbamates, and 60 per cent to organophosphates.\n\nThis problem has not emerged overnight - reduced efficacy of pyrethroid, which is used on bednets, was first noticed more than a decade ago. While there have been efforts to rotate or mix insecticides, it was not until last year that the WHO updated its recommendations to also use chlorfenapyr - the first insecticide in some 40 years, which grounds mosquitoes by causing their wings to spasm.\n\nThis has proven to be incredibly effective: a study earlier this month found that the rollout of the potent insecticide has prevented at least 13 million cases in Africa.\n\nDr Cook says the new insecticide coated bednets are \"fantastic\", but is concerned they will lull us into a false sense of security.\n\n\"It feels like we're all piling on chlorfenapyr - lots of companies are pivoting because it's been shown to be more effective, which creates more competition and brings prices down. But what's next? Will we find ourselves in the same situation 10 years down the line? There doesn't seem to be much else coming through the pipeline.\n\n\"We're spending all this money monitoring the situation, but we should have put a lot of that money into developing the new tools,\" Dr Cook adds. \"I think we've done things badly in terms of insecticide resistance. The concern is we do the same with drug resistance as well.\"\n\nThis would be a major blow. At the moment, doctors are predominantly reliant on artemisinin-based treatments to tackle malaria - between 2010 and 2022, more than four billion courses were delivered to clinics by manufacturers.\n\nCurrently, the WHO describes the status as \"partial resistance\" - drugs still work, just more slowly. But the issue is spreading, having jumped from the Greater Mekong Region where it was first noted, to Africa.\n\n\"We rely entirely on artemisinin combination treatments, of which there are over half a billion treatments given each year,\" says Prof White. \"If we lose these, we're in serious trouble - because despite all the large investments in antimalarial drug discovery in the past 20 years, we've been rather unsuccessful.\n\n\"There are new drugs that could save us - candidates from Novartis look most promising - but they are still three to five years away,\" he says.\n\nHe adds that efforts are underway to reduce the rise of resistance - such as using two other drugs alongside artemisinin, not just one, and encouraging people to finish their course. But this is likely only \"sticking a plaster\" on the issue - at some point, full resistance will spread.\n\nMost significant is the rollout of two new malaria vaccines: in July 2022 GSK's RTS,S shot, also known as Mosquirix, was approved, followed by Oxford University's R21 immunisation in December. Experts say these shots, which are around 75 per cent effective at preventing the disease in areas where transmission is seasonal, could save tens of thousands of children's lives every year.\n\n\"The vaccine is the latest 'shiny thing' for humans, but alone it's not going to end malaria transmission,\" says Prof Drakeley. \"But it will save lives... it's a nine per cent reduction in all cause mortality in children, that's massively impressive.\"\n\nOther exciting tools - from gene drive mosquitoes to spatial repellents for homes and buildings - are also emerging, with researchers describing it as an \"exciting time\" to be in the malaria field.\n\nCountries are also containing the disease: in 2023, Azerbaijan, Belize and Tajikistan all eliminated the parasitic pathogen, joining 40 other countries certified as malaria-free, while regions like southeast Asia - where the disease once thrived - now have minimal infections.\n\nYet there are concerns that the funding needed to replicate these successes is dwindling - according to analysis from Malaria No More and the Oxford Economics Group, the proportion of global research and development funding dedicated to malaria has fallen from $707m in 2019 to $604m in 2022.\n\n\"Governments, research institutions and funding organisations must keep their foot on the accelerator to continue fostering novel interventions and treatments to maintain a robust malaria pipeline for the future,\" says Gareth Jenkins, an executive director at Malaria No More UK. \"If we don't, this disease can thrive again.\"\n\nThere are other \"not very politically digestible\" issues too, says Prof White, \"such as incompetence, corruption, fabrication of data, wrong results - all those sorts of things that no one ever talks about, but are actually quite important\".\n\nAnd then there are the broader societal issues - including climate change, extreme weather events, conflict and mass migration - that could derail eradication efforts, providing opportunities for malaria to thrive and new obstacles to deliver services.\n\n\"The playground for this disease is basically social circumstances - it's poverty, lack of resources, lack of accessibility to the really basic health services,\" says Prof Miotto. \"And in that sense, the failure of rapid tests or partial artemisinin resistance makes little difference if you don't have any rapid tests, and you don't have any drugs. We can't lose sight of the basics.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_newey@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Sarah Newey",

reduction in the malaria mortality rate despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion of the 17th World Malaria Day under the theme \"Advancing health equity, gender equality and human rights,\" Dr. Moeti emphasized the need for continuous and equitable delivery of malaria services, especially to vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and rural communities.\n\nDr. Moeti highlighted recent milestones in malaria elimination, including the certification of Cabo Verde in January 2024 and the approval of the R21/MatrixM malaria vaccine, which will be rolled out in 19 African countries this year alongside the RTS,S vaccine.\n\nWhile celebrating progress, Dr. Moeti acknowledged persistent challenges facing the African region, including extreme weather events, conflict, resource constraints, and biological threats.\n\nShe called for concerted efforts to address these challenges and ensure equitable access to malaria interventions.\n\nDr. Moeti reiterated WHO's commitment to supporting strategic initiatives such as the \"High Burden High Impact\" (HBHI) approach, which targets countries hardest hit by malaria with customized interventions based on local data.\n\nShe also emphasized the importance of innovation and research to develop new strategies and tools targeting vulnerable groups.\n\nAcknowledging the critical role of partnerships, Dr. Moeti thanked organizations such as the Global Fund, the US President's Malaria Initiative, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for their support in delivering malaria services.\n\nShe called for renewed political commitments and increased investments in malaria control to achieve a malaria-free Africa.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Moeti urged governments, affected communities, and partners to prioritize malaria control efforts, strengthen health systems, and accelerate progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nShe emphasized the importance of surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation systems to target interventions effectively and adapt services to the most at-risk groups.\n\nDr. Moeti expressed confidence that by working

A very effective way to prevent malaria infection while sleeping, especially in areas where malaria is endemic, is to use insecticide-coated bed nets. These nets create a physical barrier between people and mosquitoes, reducing the possibility of nighttime attacks. To avoid mosquito bites and malaria transmission as much as possible, nets must be installed correctly and without tears. Regular maintenance and replacement are also required to maintain the effectiveness of the net over time.\n\n3. Eliminate mosquito breeding sites: To prevent mosquito breeding, dump all standing water in containers around your home. This covers buckets, old tires, flower pots, and other containers that collect water.\n\n4. Use indoor residual spraying (IRS): If you live in an area where malaria transmission is high, you may consider using IRS, which sprays insecticide on the walls and ceilings of your home to kill mosquitoes. .\n\n5. Seek treatment as soon as possible. If you develop malaria symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, or vomiting, seek medical treatment immediately. If diagnosed and treated early, the disease will not spread.\n\n6. Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened accommodations: Mosquitoes can easily enter rooms through unsealed windows and doors, so stay away from accommodations that are not well-screened or air-conditioned. Please don't.\n\n7. To prevent malaria, talk to your health care provider about the best antimalarial drug options before visiting areas where malaria is endemic. Pay attention to the usage and dosage of medicines, and be sure to follow the prescribed medicines even after returning home.\n\nThe time it takes to recover from malaria varies from person to person and is influenced by factors such as your overall health and the strength of the infection. Anyone who has had malaria is offered the following general recovery advice:\n\n1. Finish your prescribed treatment period: Be sure to finish your antimalarial medication, even if you start feeling better before you finish your treatment period. This increases the chance that the parasite will be completely removed from the body.\n\n2. Rest: Give your body time to relax and heal. Malaria can affect your body, so get plenty of rest and avoid physically demanding activities until you are completely well.\n\n3. Drink plenty of fluids such as water, juices, and electrolyte solutions to keep your body hydrated and help remove toxins.\n\n4. Eat nutritious foods: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains to help your body heal and strengthen your immune system. Please concentrate on\n\n5. Take precautions to avoid future mosquito bites, such as applying insect repellent, sleeping under a mosquito net, and wearing protective clothing, especially if you live or visit a malaria-endemic area.\n\n6. It is important to listen to your doctor's instructions and suggestions regarding medication, rest, and follow-up appointments.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Endemism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indoor residual spraying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antimalarial medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Healthy diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Allergies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Allergies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Nutrition", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Nutrition", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109578556,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-530932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Of these P. falciparum is the most deadly parasite responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world\".\n\n\"Severe malaria infections, particularly with Plasmodium falciparum, during the first half of pregnancy, can lead to microcephaly and reduced uteroplacental blood flow, depriving the foetus of oxygen and nutrients. This can result in preterm birth, low birth weight, and even foetal death,\" Dr Sanjay Majumdar, Consultant Paediatrician, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, told IANS.\n\nWhile mild infections are less likely to cause immediate neonatal danger, they still carry the potential for long-term neurological consequences.\n\n\"Neurological hazards for newborns include intrauterine growth retardation, hypoxic brain injury, seizures, lower IQ, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and learning disabilities. These issues stem from the maternal inflammatory immune response affecting foetal brain development,\" Dr Majumdar said.\n\nTo mitigate the risks, regular antenatal clinic visits are crucial for early detection and treatment.\n\nTesting for malaria should be conducted promptly if the mother exhibits symptoms like fever or weakness.\n\n\"It's essential to monitor these children's development and academic achievements closely to address any potential deficits early on. By emphasising early detection, treatment, and ongoing support, we can mitigate the long-term neurological effects of malaria during pregnancy and promote healthier outcomes for both mothers and babies,\" the doctor said.\n\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that India has 15 million cases of malaria with 19,500-20,000 deaths annually.\n\nAlthough malaria is deadly, it is preventable and curable, Dr Abhishek Gupta, Consultant - Pediatric And Pediatric Intensivist, Manipal Hospital Gurugram, told IANS.\n\n\"The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person,\" he noted.\n\nSymptoms range from fever, \u2060chills, \u2060and headache to fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty in breathing. However, early detection and treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse. \"Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common,\" Dr Gupta said.\n\nHe also suggested using mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present; using mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin) after dusk; and wearing protective clothing.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium falciparum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_knowlesi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium knowlesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium ovale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_malariae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium malariae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium vivax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intrauterine growth restriction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=%27Malaria+during+pregnancy+increases+neurological+risks+for+babies%27", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 19, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

If left untreated in humans, malaria can cause severe symptoms, health complications and even death.\n\nIn tropical and subtropical regions where malaria is prevalent, scientists are concerned that climate warming might increase the risk of malaria transmission in certain areas and contribute to further spread. However, there is still much to learn about the relationship between temperature and the mosquito and parasite traits that influence malaria transmission.\n\nIn \"Estimating the effects of temperature on transmission of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum,\" a groundbreaking study published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers at the University of Florida, Pennsylvania State University and Imperial College, combined novel experimental data within an innovative modeling framework to examine how temperature might affect transmission risk in different environments in Africa.\n\n\"In broad terms, scientists know that temperature affects key traits such as mosquito longevity, the time it takes for a mosquito to become infectious after feeding on an infected host, and the overall ability of the mosquito to transmit the disease,\" said Matthew Thomas, a UF/IFAS professor and UF/IFAS Invasion Science Research Institute (ISRI) director. \"But what might seem surprising is that these temperature dependencies have not been properly measured for any of the primary malaria vectors in Africa\".\n\n\"Our findings provide novel insights into the effects of temperature on the ability of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes -- arguably the most important malaria mosquito in Africa -- to transmit Plasmodium falciparum, the most prevalent species of human malaria in Africa,\" said Eunho Suh, joint first author with Isaac Stopard at Imperial College, and assistant research professor at Penn State, who conducted the empirical research as a post-doctoral student in Thomas' previous lab.\n\n\"The novel data were then used to explore the implications of temperature on malaria transmission potential across four locations in Kenya that represent diverse current environments with different intensities of baseline transmission, and that are predicted to experience different patterns of warming under climate change,\" explained Thomas.\n\nThe study supports previous research results in demonstrating that various mosquito and parasite traits exhibit intermittent relationships with temperature and that under future warming temperatures, transmission potential is likely to increase in some environments but could reduce in others. However, the new data suggest that parasites can develop more quickly at cooler temperatures and that the rate of parasite development might be less sensitive to changes in temperature, than previously thought.\n\nThe data also indicate that the successful development of parasites in the mosquito, declines at thermal extremes, contributing to the upper and lower environmental bounds for transmission.\n\nCombining these results into a simple transmission model suggests that contrary to earlier predictions, the anticipated surge in malaria transmission, attributed to climate warming, may be less severe than feared, particularly in cooler regions like the Kenyan Highlands.\n\n\"Some of the current assumptions on mosquito ecology and malaria transmission derive from work done in the early part of the last century. Our study is significant in highlighting the need to revisit some of this conventional understanding,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"While the time it takes for a mosquito to become infectious is strongly dependent on environmental temperature, it also depends on the species and possibly strain of malaria and mosquito,\" said Suh.\n\nThe comprehensive study and findings represent a significant step forward in understanding the intricacies of malaria transmission and paves the way for future research aimed at controlling malaria on a global scale.\n\n\"Our work focused on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. However, Plasmodium vivax is another important parasite species responsible for most malaria in Asia, as well as the recently reported malaria cases in the U.S.,\" said Suh. \"Like Plasmodium falciparum, the established model describing the effects of temperature on development of Plasmodium vivax remains poorly validated.\"\n\nThe same is true for other vector-borne diseases, such as dengue or Zika virus, added Suh.\n\n\"We need more work of the type we present in the current paper, ideally using local mosquito and parasite or pathogen strains, to better understand the effects of climate and climate change on transmission risk,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "technologynetworks.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technology Networks"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Food_and_Agricultural_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium falciparum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles_gambiae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles gambiae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Communications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subtropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Longevity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium vivax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zika virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Microbiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://assets.technologynetworks.com/production/dynamic/images/content/386121/researchers-shed-light-on-the-effects-of-climate-change-on-malaria-transmission-386121-640x360.jpg?cb=20240425", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The day is an opportunity for people to come together to share information, advocate and promote interventions that can help prevent and treat malaria.\n\nWorld Malaria Day, observed annually on April 25, is a global initiative to raise awareness about malaria and mobilise efforts to control and eradicate this deadly disease. Established by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2007, this day serves as a reminder of the ongoing fight against malaria, which continues to be a significant public health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The theme of World Malaria Day varies each year, focusing on different aspects of malaria prevention, treatment, and research. The day is an opportunity for governments, organisations, and individuals to share information, advocate for increased resources, and promote interventions that can help prevent and treat malaria. World Malaria Day 2024 Date, Theme, History and Significance: Know About the International Observance Recognising Global Efforts To Control Malaria.\n\nEfforts on World Malaria Day include distributing mosquito nets, raising funds for research and treatment programs, and educating communities about preventive measures such as using insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and seeking prompt diagnosis and treatment for malaria infections. As you observe World Malaria Day 2024, we at LatestLY have compiled a list of foods you must eat and food you must avoid when recovering from malaria. World Malaria Day: Slogans, Messages and Wallpapers To Spread Education About Malaria and Its Prevention.\n\n1. Fruits and Vegetables: Fresh fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that can support your immune system. Citrus fruits like oranges and lemons and leafy greens like spinach and kale are excellent choices.\n\n2. Lean Proteins: Foods rich in lean proteins, such as chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes (like lentils and beans), can help repair tissues and support muscle recovery.\n\n3. Whole Grains: Whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread provide sustained energy and essential nutrients like B vitamins, which are beneficial for recovery.\n\n4. Healthy Fats: Foods containing healthy fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, are essential for overall health and aid nutrient absorption.\n\n5. Fluids: Staying hydrated is crucial during recovery. Water, herbal teas, and coconut water are good choices. Electrolyte-rich beverages like sports drinks or oral rehydration solutions may be recommended if severe dehydration occurs during the illness.\n\n1. Sugary Foods and Beverages: Avoid sugary foods and drinks as they can suppress the immune system and cause energy spikes and crashes.\n\n2. Processed Foods: Highly processed foods like fast food, chips, and pre-packaged snacks often contain unhealthy fats, excessive salt, and additives that can hinder recovery.\n\n3. Alcohol: Alcohol can interfere with medications, dehydrate the body, and weaken the immune system. It's best to avoid alcohol until fully recovered.\n\n4. Fatty and Fried Foods: Foods high in unhealthy fats, such as fried foods, fatty meats, and full-fat dairy products, can be challenging to digest and may not provide the nutrients needed for recovery.\n\n5. Caffeine: While a moderate amount of caffeine is usually acceptable, excessive caffeine consumption can lead to dehydration, which is not ideal during recovery. It is best to consume caffeinated beverages in moderation or opt for decaffeinated options.\n\nIt's essential to listen to your body and consult with healthcare professionals or a nutritionist for personalised advice based on your specific recovery needs. A balanced diet with various nutrient-dense foods will support your body's healing process and help you regain strength after battling malaria.\n\n(This article is written for an informative purpose and should not be substituted for medical advice.

World Malaria Day is observed every year on April 25, to spread awareness about the mosquito-borne life-threatening disease spread to humans by female Anopheles mosquitoes and caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. Of these P. falciparum is the most deadly parasite responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths.\n\nThis year's theme is \"Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world\".\n\n\"Severe malaria infections, particularly with Plasmodium falciparum, during the first half of pregnancy, can lead to microcephaly and reduced uteroplacental blood flow, depriving the foetus of oxygen and nutrients. This can result in preterm birth, low birth weight, and even foetal death,\" Dr Sanjay Majumdar, Consultant Paediatrician, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, told VOICE.\n\nWhile mild infections are less likely to cause immediate neonatal danger, they still carry the potential for long-term neurological consequences.\n\n\"Neurological hazards for newborns include intrauterine growth retardation, hypoxic brain injury, seizures, lower IQ, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, and learning disabilities. These issues stem from the maternal inflammatory immune response affecting foetal brain development,\" Dr Majumdar said.\n\nTo mitigate the risks, regular antenatal clinic visits are crucial for early detection and treatment.\n\nTesting for malaria should be conducted promptly if the mother exhibits symptoms like fever or weakness.\n\n\"It's essential to monitor these children's development and academic achievements closely to address any potential deficits early on. By emphasising early detection, treatment, and ongoing support, we can mitigate the long-term neurological effects of malaria during pregnancy and promote healthier outcomes for both mothers and babies,\" the doctor said.\n\nThe World Health Organisation estimates that India has 15 million cases of malaria with 19,500-20,000 deaths annually.\n\nAlthough malaria is deadly, it is preventable and curable, Dr Abhishek Gupta, Consultant - Pediatric And Pediatric Intensivist, Manipal Hospital Gurugram, told VOICE.\n\n\"The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person,\" he noted.\n\nSymptoms range from fever, \u2060chills, \u2060and headache to fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty in breathing. However, early detection and treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse. \"Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common,\" Dr Gupta said.\n\nHe also suggested using mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present; using mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535, or Icaridin) after dusk; and wearing protective clothing.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium falciparum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_knowlesi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium knowlesi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium ovale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_malariae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium malariae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium vivax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_birth_weight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low birth weight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_growth_restriction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intrauterine growth restriction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/8524c4b1a50eb63b72d7d38ffa14a03d-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 19, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

It's a day dedicated to raising awareness about malaria, advocating for increased efforts to combat the disease, and celebrating progress made in malaria prevention and treatment.\n\nRecovering from malaria typically involves a combination of medical treatment and self-care practices. Here are some tips to aid your recovery\n\nTake all prescribed medications exactly as instructed by your healthcare provider. Completing the full course of treatment is crucial to ensure the malaria parasite is completely eradicated from your body.\n\nPinterest\n\nMalaria can cause fatigue and weakness, so it's important to get plenty of rest. Listen to your body and avoid overexertion until you regain your strength. Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal teas, and oral rehydration solutions, to prevent dehydration, especially if you have been experiencing fever and sweating.\n\nEat nutritious foods to support your immune system and aid in recovery. Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n\nOver-the-counter medications may help alleviate symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches. However, consult your doctor before taking any additional medication to ensure it won't interfere with your treatment.\n\nPinterest\n\nMalaria is transmitted through infected mosquitoes, so take precautions to prevent further spread.

The \u00a37.4 million support for MedAccess will be used to negotiate lower prices for vital malaria drugs and diagnostic tests for people in countries affected by the disease.\n\nThe funding brings total UK support to MedAccess to \u00a317.4 million, which will help one million people access new diagnostic tests and 120 million patients to receive anti-malarial treatments.\n\nMedAccess guarantees sales volumes of drugs in markets where demand is uncertain so manufacturers can commit to affordable prices and stable supply. In return, manufacturers receive assurance that they will be paid even if the demand doesn't materialise.\n\nIn three years, it is expected that more than 50 million people will have access to drugs and other items.\n\nThe announcement comes on the World Health Organisation's World Malaria Day, which aims to keep the disease high on the political agenda, mobilize additional resources, and empower communities.\n\nDeputy Foreign Secretary and Minister for Development and Africa, Andrew Mitchell, said, \"Thanks to British science, we now have life-saving malaria vaccines which will protect millions of people.\n\n\"But we also need to make sure we are making drugs available at the best possible price to the countries that most need them. Deaths from malaria are entirely preventable and the UK's support for MedAccess will ensure that countries can afford to offer people the best protection against the disease.\"\n\nIt has also been announced that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Benin will begin their first rollout of the UK-Indian developed RTS,S vaccine, marking a significant milestone in ending malaria.\n\nCollaboration between British scientists and Indian manufacturers resulted in two essential malaria vaccines being developed - RTS,S and R21. These have been used in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, with two million children vaccinated since 2019, and, in January, Cameroon became the first country to give the vaccines to children routinely.\n\nA total of 22 countries are due to roll out the vaccine. Gavi, which is funded by the UK, is aiming to immunise more than six million children from malaria by the end of 2025.\n\nUK funding helps MedAccess to reduce the costs of a range of innovative health products for HIV, TB and malaria, meaning that UK support for organisations like Gavi and the Global Fund will go further as they benefit from lower prices for products.\n\nChief Executive Officer for MedAccess, Michael Anderson, said, \"We are deeply grateful for FCDO's continued support, which enables MedAccess to improve access to products for HIV, TB, and malaria in support of Global Fund programmes.\n\n\"MedAccess will continue to use innovative financial tools to reduce the cost of diagnosis, prevention and treatment, improving value for money while improving patient access.\n\n\"We are glad to announce this renewed funding on World Malaria Day, an important moment for global stakeholders to come together with a common ambition to accelerate malaria prevention and control.\"",

Among many other misfortunes, that downpour produced a massive increase in malaria cases in the country: from 400,000 cases to more than 1.6 million.\n\nThis case once again highlighted that climate change has profound implications for ecosystems and biodiversity, but also for human health. And that among the health threats exacerbated by this climate crisis, the expansion and increase of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, represent one of the most significant challenges to global public health.\n\nMalaria is a disease caused by parasites and transmitted to humans through the bite of mosquitoes that has been a serious health problem for centuries... and continues to be so: today, in the world, one child under 5 years of age dies every minute due to this disease that, last year alone, caused more than 600,000 deaths, especially in the African region, which is home to 94% of the cases.\n\nThe fight against malaria and its uncertain end as a public health problem in 2030 faces great challenges: international financing has been stagnant since 2015, there is still no effective vaccine, mosquitoes are generating resistance to insecticides and people to antibiotics. And, meanwhile, climate change is expanding the seasons and territories reached by mosquitoes.\n\nGlobal warming accelerated by human activity - CO2 emissions have increased by 50% in the last sixty years - is facilitating the expansion of mosquitoes into areas and habitats that were previously inhospitable due to their low temperatures, but which are increasingly more suitable.\n\nThis includes the rise of these insects to more mountainous regions and their expansion to higher latitudes on the planet, putting populations and communities that have not historically been exposed at risk of infection. It was also the case with the Pakistan floods: there was a higher proportion of cases coming from mosquitoes carrying the deadliest species of the disease, typically found in Africa rather than Asia.\n\nFurthermore, risk seasons are lengthened in places where the mosquito is already present. Comparing measurements from the 1950s to those from the last decade (2012-2021), rising temperatures have caused an increase in the length of the malaria transmission season of 31.3% on land. highlands of the Americas and 13.8% in the highlands of Africa, according to The Lancet Countdown report for 2022.\n\nExtreme weather events such as heat waves or floods are becoming more frequent, and they also have a huge impact on disease transmission. Heavy rains and stagnant flood waters create more breeding habitats for these insects. But in addition, variations in rainfall and temperature patterns affect the survival and reproduction of mosquitoes and the life cycle of the malaria parasite.\n\nPeriods of intense heat can accelerate the maturation of the parasite inside the mosquito, reducing the time needed for it to become infective; while prolonged droughts can concentrate human and mosquito activity around limited water sources, increasing transmission rates.\n\nThe increase in the incidence and distribution of malaria is notable, and very worrying. Between 2019 and 2022, cases increased from 231 to 249 million. And it's getting worse: the WHO estimates that by 2030 there will be 250,000 additional deaths annually attributed to climate change alone and caused by malaria, diarrhea, malnutrition and heat.\n\nMultilateral health organizations such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria - responsible for channeling and providing 65% of international financing against malaria - have begun to incorporate climate change into their work strategies and policies. . In fact, over the next three years, this organization, which is the largest international piggy bank that exists against these pandemics, will allocate 70% of its financing - about $9 billion - to the 50 countries most vulnerable to the climate.\n\nHowever, each year the gap between existing resources and those needed to end malaria as a public health problem widens. In 2022, global funding reached $4.1 billion, a far cry from the almost $8 billion that the WHO says is needed annually. Furthermore, climate financing focused on health is still very insufficient: between 2018 and 2020, only 0.3% - $14 million - of multilateral financing for climate change adaptation was allocated specifically to the health sector. The efforts that must be made are notable, even more so, if possible, with the growing threat of climate change, declared by the WHO as one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.\n\n*Pablo Trillo is a journalist at Salud por Derecho.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biodiversity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lancet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Field Crops", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.usanews.net/images/haberler/2024/04/_2ac54.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Established in May 2007 during the 60th session of the World Health Assembly, the day makes us realise that malaria is still a deadly disease in many parts of the country, especially in Africa. Billions of people in more than 100 nations are at risk of malaria. The day originated from the concept of Africa Malaria Day, which was also celebrated on April 25.\n\nMalaria was deadliest before the advancement of medical science and particularly the crucial discovery of Ronald Ross. He was a British medical doctor who got the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1902 for his breakthrough on malaria transmission. He was the first British to receive the Nobel Prize and was also the first recipient who was born outside Europe. In 1897, he found the malarial parasite in the mosquito's gastrointestinal tract 1897 and showed the world for the first time that malaria is a mosquito-borne disease.\n\nBorn on May 13, 1857, in British India's Almora, Ross studied in England before coming back to India in 1881. After being posted in several places, he finally became the Acting Garrison Surgeon at Bengaluru in 1883. It was during his stay there that he found that mosquitoes can be controlled by curbing their water access. When he went to Londo in 1894, he met Sir Patrick Manson who showed him the real problems in the research of malaria. He considered India to be the best place to study malaria and Ross returned here in April 1895.\n\nHis official work hampered his research, but Ross got momentum when he was transferred to Secunderabad in May 1896. In August 1897, he confirmed that there was a malarial parasite inside the mosquito's gut and the growth of the parasite there. He came to Kolkata on February 17, 1898, to work in the Presidency General Hospital which is now known as the IPGMER and SSKM Hospital. Since Kolkata, the capital of British India, was not facing the threat of malaria and patients were given medications, Manson urged Ross to use birds.\n\nDuring the experiments of birds in Kolkata, Ross established the significance of culex mosquitoes as intermediate hosts in avian malaria. He found that mosquitoes store malarial parasites in the salivary gland and they release the parasites during biting. He demonstrated the transmission of the malarial parasite from healthy sparrows to an infected one and showed the malarial parasite's life cycle.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType":

Today the UK Health Security Agency said the number of cases diagnosed in travellers coming home was the worst for 20 years.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 2,004 malaria cases were confirmed among individuals who had recently travelled abroad, showing a significant increase from 1,369 cases recorded in 2022. In a message on X today the UKHSA said: \"Our latest data show a concerning rise in travel-related cases of #malaria, with the highest number of diagnoses in 20 years. \"\n\nThe UKHSA has said: \"In the UK the threat from vector-borne diseases is on the rise, due to factors like growing global travel and trade, changes in land use and climate change.\n\n\"According to the latest data, imported malaria cases to England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2023 have exceeded 2000 cases for the first time in 20 years. Cases were confirmed in individuals who had recently been abroad. The number of cases highlights the importance of taking precautions to minimise the risk of malaria when travelling abroad.\"\n\nLast month The UKSHA released new figures showing soaring levels of illnesses including dengue and malaria caused by exposure to mosquitos in travellers coming home to the UK. Those illnesses can cause severe disease, and officials say it highlights the need for travellers to take precautions to reduce health risks while abroad. Cases were confirmed in parts of the UK in individuals who had recently been abroad.\n\nA total of 1,637 malaria cases were confirmed in England from January to October 2023. Cases returned to pre-pandemic levels, similar to the 1,719 cases reported in the UK in 2019 and matching closely with the average of 1,612 cases reported between 2010 and 2019. The WHO reports that in 2022, global malaria cases were estimated at 249 million, surpassing pre-pandemic levels by 16 million compared to 2019.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of malaria, health experts emphasise following the ABCD of malaria prevention:\n\nAwareness of risk: Travelers should be aware of the malaria risk in their destination and seek appropriate advice. Bite prevention: Use insect repellents, cover exposed skin, and sleep under treated bed nets. Chemoprophylaxis: Take malaria prevention tablets as prescribed. Diagnose promptly and treat: Seek immediate medical attention if malaria symptoms develop.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) spoke out saying holidaymakers should check well in advance of their trip, to ensure they have enough time to get any necessary vaccinations. Illnesses which people have caught abroad and brought back to the UK include measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis, meningitis, and tetanus.\n\nThe UKHSA also warned that even when vaccinated it can take a few weeks for the immunity to take effect. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: \"Nobody wants to get stricken down with sickness on their holidays or when travelling far away from home and it can be especially stressful and worrying if your child gets ill - sadly this does happen, but for many serious illnesses it is preventable.\n\n\"That's why it's so important if you're going on holidays overseas to be sure that you and all your family, especially young children, are up to date with all routine NHS vaccines well before you travel, in particular both MMR vaccines.\n\n\"Measles is one of the most highly infectious diseases and some countries are currently seeing very large outbreaks. There is also the risk of returning home and spreading measles to unvaccinated family and friends, with infants and pregnant women at high risk of serious illness or life-long complications.\"", "source": {"uri": "bristolpost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bristol Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_hurst@bristolpost.co.uk", "name": "Ben Hurst", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Health Security Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Measles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rubella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MMR vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tetanus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meningitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hepatitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9246245.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1209159872.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

The disease is common in Kenya, and it is preventable and curable, but poverty makes it deadly for those who can't afford treatment.\n\nIn the family\u00b4s compound in the western county of Migori, three other graves are visible, that of Awuor\u00b4s husband and their other two children who died from malaria before the age of 2.\n\nAwuor, 31, fell ill in December and lost her five-month pregnancy before succumbing to malaria. Her 11-year-old son is the family's only survivor.\n\nMalaria is still a significant public health challenge in Kenya, though some progress may be coming. Parts of Kenya participated in an important pilot of the world\u00b4s first malaria vaccine, with a reported drop in deaths for children under 5. Kenya's health ministry hasn't said when the vaccine will be widely available.\n\nThe biggest impact is felt in regions characterized by high temperatures like Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, and places with high rainfall like the western region near Lake Victoria.\n\nFriends and family lower the casket of Rose Bella Awuor, 31 years, after a funeral service at her home in Awendo, Migori County, Kenya Thursday, April. 11, 2024.

(AP Photo/Brian Ongoro)\n\nKenya had an estimated 5 million malaria cases and over 12,000 deaths reported in 2022, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nMost of those affected are children under 5 and pregnant women.\n\nKenya continues to combat malaria with traditional methods such as distributing bed nets that are treated with insecticides, spraying breeding areas, and promoting prompt diagnosis and treatment, but experts say progress against the disease with those approaches has plateaued.\n\nPublic health expert Dr. Willis Akhwale, special adviser for the Kenya End Malaria Council, said the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down distribution of drugs and treatment.\n\nHe said innovative treatment methods are needed in the wake of drug resistant cases reported in parts of Africa.\n\n\"We need to start looking at investments in new generation medicines. That should then be able to counter any resistance in (the) foreseeable future,\" he said.\n\nAkhwale said other needs include more funding and logistical support.\n\n\"In Kenya the shortfall in terms of the need is almost $52 million, so we need to close that gap,\" he said, citing health ministry data. He recommended domestic funding and private sector support amid donor fatigue with crises around the world.\n\nWilson Otieno has been admitted to a hospital three times for malaria and has received outpatient treatment countless times. It's expensive for the 33-year-old accountant and father in the lakeside city of Kisumu.\n\nMalaria is never \"pocket friendly,\" he said.\n\nSome progress has been made with local manufacturing of crucial medication.\n\nThe Kenya-based Universal Corporation Limited last year received the WHO\u00b4s approval to produce an antimalarial drug known as Spaq, a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine.\n\nThe approval was an important step in Africa\u00b4s capacity to make lifesaving medications, a new focus for governments and public health officials after vulnerabilities were exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Africa relies heavily on drug imports.\n\n\"It will really help in lowering the dependency for imports as we saw during the COVID era, where whatever was being imported actually had huge supply disruptions,\" said Palu Dhanani, the founder and managing director of UCL.\n\nIf you don\u00b4t get the right medicine at the right time, malaria can cause unnecessary deaths, Dhanani said.\n\nTiro reported from Nairobi, Kenya.

This is a drop of more than 10 percent since 2021 (-$73 million), and was the lowest level of funding in the past 15 years. According to the report, funding for malaria vaccines fell for a fifth consecutive year, to a record low of $106 million. Meanwhile, drugs received the largest share of funding ($235 million), although the segment also saw a drop of 12 percent (-$33 million).\n\nYet, other diseases received even less attention.

Additionally, the social and economic costs of the disease are estimated at $12 billion a year in Africa alone.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made over the years, the journey towards eliminating malaria remains challenging. One of the necessary paths forward requires a fundamental shift in how the world approaches research and development, prioritising equity, inclusivity, and collaboration.\n\nWhen dealing with complex global health problems like malaria, we must not exclude anyone from the conversation. Every stakeholder, from African scientists and female researchers to the youth and affected communities, has a unique and invaluable contribution to make. Excluding these voices not only sabotages the effectiveness of our efforts but also promotes inequalities.\n\nSome conventional narratives often sideline African scientists, casting them merely as data collectors rather than active contributors shaping the trajectory of scientific research. This must change, because those most affected by a problem would be most motivated to solve it. Our continent is brimming with talent, innovation, and resilience. We can catalyse groundbreaking advancements in malaria control and elimination by empowering African scientists and providing them with the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.\n\nTarget Malaria has done so much to develop African scientists, investing in capacity building, mentorship, and skills development, to nurture the next generation of African scientists of all genders and ensure their voices are heard and valued in the fight against malaria.\n\nOur consortium, which spans Ghana, Burkina Faso, Uganda, and has previously operated in Mali and Cape Verde, embodies the spirit of collaboration and shared learning. Target Malaria believes that solutions for Africa should be designed with Africans, not just for them. Whilst the initial design of genetic modifications may originate in Europe, the subsequent development and evaluation take place in Africa, ensuring that our interventions are contextually relevant and responsive to the needs of local communities.\n\nFemale scientists, in particular, face systemic barriers and biases. As a female scientist from Uganda, I have navigated these obstacles firsthand. Several people, including my teachers in high school and university, consistently urged me to study something more mainstream, as they were convinced that there would be nowhere for me to work - in Africa and as a woman. Some still wonder how I was not only able to study genetic science, but be working on a project of this scale and importance, right here on the continent - in Uganda.\n\nMy work at Target Malaria has exposed me to several platforms on the continent and globally, which I embrace as an opportunity to challenge mindsets about scientific research and the development of tools in Africa.\n\nThe youth are also critical to this narrative, representing the present and the future. Their voices must be heard, and their perspectives valued. By engaging them early in the research and development process, we can instil a sense of ownership, foster a culture of innovation, and ensure continuity in the fight against malaria.\n\nCOVID-19 taught us that we are one world, interconnected and interdependent. Therefore, the fight against malaria requires a united front, where all stakeholders, regardless of gender, age, or nationality, come together to share knowledge, resources, and expertise. By embracing inclusivity, collaboration, and equity, we can accelerate progress towards a malaria-free world and create lasting change for future generations.", "source": {"uri": "iafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Global health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capacity building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cape Verde"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burkina Faso"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Burkina Faso"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Associations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Organizations", "wgt": 15}], "image": "https://iafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mosquito-malaria.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Malaria, transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito, is fatal and a danger to vulnerable populations including children under the age of 5, pregnant women, and individuals without previous exposure to the parasite.\n\nRecognizing the impact of this disease, Newmont dedicates March and April each year to heighten awareness and reduce its spread among its workforce, families, and host communities. The programme, introduced in 2021, has achieved remarkable success in reducing infections among employees with an emphasis on awareness creation and engagement.\n\nThrough carefully curated health talks led by medical practitioners and nutritionists, extensive interactions are held to provide adequate information focusing on preventive measures. The programme is designed to provide a deep understanding of how malaria is transmitted, prevented, detected, early and effective treatment and good nutrition.\n\nOne of the most important initiatives in this programme is the 'Screen and Treat' exercise, which exemplifies the company's proactive approach to the holistic well-being of its workforce. Healthcare professionals visit Newmont's offices through April to conduct scheduled malaria tests on the workforce. Positive cases are referred for immediate treatment, contributing to a significant reduction in morbidity.\n\nThese initiatives form part of Newmont's broader commitment to the health and safety of its workforce and falls in line with World Malaria Day, which is marked on 25th April each year, to commemorate the global fight against malaria.\n\nThis year's theme 'Accelerating the fight against malaria for a more equitable world', calls for more concerted efforts to make quality, timely, and affordable services available to prevent, detect, and treat malaria for all.\n\nOther measures implemented to protect the employees from the disease include the treatment of puddles of water within controlled cones with environmentally friendly chemicals to get rid of the larvae, indoor residual spraying where insecticides are applied on walls across the sites to knock off mosquitoes as well as the allocation of mosquito repellents to the workforce.\n\nNewmont's infectious disease laboratories at the Abirem Government Hospital in the Eastern Region and the Kenyasi Health Centre in the Ahafo Region continue to support the testing and treatment of such infectious diseases. Through Newmont's partnership with the Project C.U.R.E., health centres within the host communities in Akyem and Ahafo have received medical supplies to support malaria prevention and treatment among others.\n\nLast year, Newmont's medical services provider refurbished the Yamfo Health Centre's laboratory in Yamfo in the Ahafo Region and donated essential equipment worth about GHS103,000 to the facility. The donation was to enhance the health centre's lab functionality and improve health service delivery especially in diagnosing and treating malaria.\n\nNewmont's proactive approach towards the campaign against malaria underscores the company's broader commitment to the safety and well-being of its workforce and the host communities.", "source": {"uri": "peacefmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Peace Fm Online - Ghana News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitic disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahafo_Region", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahafo Region"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cone cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Region_(Ghana)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Region (Ghana)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eastern Region (Ghana)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyasi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenyasi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kenyasi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamfo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yamfo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yamfo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.peacefmonline.com/photos/news/202404/271066263_176568.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1740, "textEnd": 1750}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The \u00a37.4 million support for MedAccess will be used to negotiate lower prices for vital malaria drugs and diagnostic tests for people in countries affected by the disease.\n\nThe funding brings total UK support to MedAccess to \u00a317.4 million, which will help one million people access new diagnostic tests and 120 million patients to receive anti-malarial treatments.\n\nMedAccess guarantees sales volumes of drugs in markets where demand is uncertain so manufacturers can commit to affordable prices and stable supply. In return, manufacturers receive assurance that they will be paid even if the demand doesn't materialise.\n\nIn three years, it is expected that more than 50 million people will have access to drugs and other items.\n\nThe announcement comes on the World Health Organisation's World Malaria Day, which aims to keep the disease high on the political agenda, mobilize additional resources, and empower communities.\n\nDeputy Foreign Secretary and Minister for Development and Africa, Andrew Mitchell, said:\n\nThanks to British science, we now have life-saving malaria vaccines which will protect millions of people.\n\nBut we also need to make sure we are making drugs available at the best possible price to the countries that most need them. Deaths from malaria are entirely preventable and the UK's support for MedAccess will ensure that countries can afford to offer people the best protection against the disease.\n\nIt has also been announced that Sierra Leone, Liberia and Benin will begin their first roll out of the UK-Indian developed RTS,S vaccine, marking a significant milestone in ending malaria.\n\nCollaboration between British scientists and Indian manufacturers resulted in two essential malaria vaccines being developed - RTS,S and R21. These have been used in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, with two million children vaccinated since 2019, and, in January, Cameroon became the first country to give the vaccines to children routinely.\n\nA total of 22 countries are due to roll out the vaccine. Gavi, which is funded by the UK, is aiming to immunise more than six million children from malaria by the end of 2025.\n\nUK funding helps MedAccess to reduce the costs of a range of innovative health products for HIV, TB and malaria, meaning that UK support for organisation like Gavi and the Global Fund will go further as they benefit from lower prices for products.\n\nChief Executive Officer for MedAccess, Michael Anderson, said:", "source": {"uri": "gov.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "gov.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benin"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Benin"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaria vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GAVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTS,S", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RTS,S"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Global_Fund_to_Fight_AIDS,_Tuberculosis_and_Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malawi"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ghana"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameroon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cameroon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-03837e1cec82f217cf32514635a13c879b8c400ae3b1c207c5744411658c7635.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 243, "textEnd": 251}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

In the word of Betty Williams, \"there's no use talking about the problem unless you talk about the solution.\"\n\nAnd finding a solution to any common problem is not only a way to make the world a better place for healthy living, it's also the easiest route to create wealth -- lasting wealth that comes with peace of mind.\n\nMalaria is a plasmodia disease caused by some plasmodium species such as P. falciprum, P. vivax, P. ovale etc. Female Anopheles mosquito is the vector.\n\nA water-arthropod disease, the measures to control Malaria should among other things address the environmental factors and the mosquito vector, while effective treatment should target the plasmodium parasite or pathogen in the human body.\n\nMalaria, a debilitating infectious disease characterized by chills, shaking, and periodic bouts of intense fever is one of the major killer disease in tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nYes, malaria is a killer disease that has killed millions of people -- and it is still killing people today, despite some great pharmaco-medical breakthroughs.\n\nThe high morbidity and mortality rates of Malaria persist because both the infecting parasite and its mosquito carrier have, to some extent, become resistant to most antimalarial and insecticides. This is where Kuriba stands out today!\n\nWhat is Kuriba?\n\nKuriba capsule is a novel herbal remedy registered by NAFDAC for the management of feverish conditions. It is a combination therapy containing 5 different medicinal herbs with established antimalarial activities among others. Being a new product, the chances of malaria parasites becoming resistant to it, at least for now, is rare if not impossible.\n\nApart from having synergistic effects, the different mechanisms of action of the constituent herbs will make it very difficult for any species or strain of malaria parasite to develop resistance to it.\n\nWith Kuriba, the health profession now has additional product to fight the malaria war and curtail its menace.\n\nHowever, there is need for more collaboration and research on this product, with emphasis on post marketing surveillance.\n\nBeing invented and formulated by Livy-Elcon Emereonye, a pharmacist, naturopath, herbalist, and a research fellow who also authored the book: \"Malaria War -- the winning strategies\", interested individuals and concerned organizations should look into this product to authenticate its potency and ensure its accessibility.\n\nThe government, in whatever capacity, should partner with the inventor and manufacturer of this product with a view to subsidize the cost and make it available to those that will benefit from it.\n\nKuriba capsules can be used as complementary or alternative remedy. It can also be for prophylaxis.\n\nThe possible side effects of Kuriba include GIT disturbances, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nKuriba capsules is proudly manufactured in Nigeria by Letonia Int'l Ltd.\n\nAn editorial in commoration of 2024 World Malaria Day", "source": {"uri": "independent.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Independent Newspapers Nigeria"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Williams_(peace_activist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Betty Williams (peace activist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_ovale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium ovale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_vivax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plasmodium vivax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hippocrates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herbal medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combination therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_plants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicinal plants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Food_and_Water_Borne", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Food and Water Borne", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot_20240424-222321.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Roll-out to health facilities nationwide will follow, targeting all six-month-old babies at risk of malaria-related death.\n\nSierra Leone is among the countries with the highest malaria burden globally, with over two million hospital visits annually attributed to the disease, half of these are children under the age of five. Malaria also accounts for 25% of all child deaths in the country.\n\n\"With the new, safe, and efficacious malaria vaccine, we now have an additional tool to fight this disease. In combination with insecticide-treated nets, effective diagnosis and treatment, and indoor spraying, no child should die from malaria infection,\" said Dr Austin Demby, Minister of Health.\n\nUNICEF, and WHO, along with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, USAID's Breakthrough ACTION, Save the Children, the President's Malaria Initiative, and World Vision, have supported national health authorities to strengthen =vaccine introduction measures.\n\n\"The launch of the malaria vaccine into the routine immunization service marks a laudable venture, ensuring that every child between the ages of 6 to 23 months has access to this life-saving intervention. This initiative not only underscores our commitment to achieving universal health coverage but also reflects our resolve to leave no child behind,\" said Liv Elin Indreiten - UNICEF Representative a.i \"It is a pivotal moment in our journey towards a malaria-free Sierra Leone complementing existing interventions such as insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and prompt diagnosis and treatment,\" she said.\n\nA nationwide malaria campaign to distribute nearly 5.4 million special Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs) using a digitized registration system for the very first time, is being rolled out across the country. With $5.3 million from the Global Fund, UNICEF, WHO, and other partners are supporting the Ministry of Health in this effort.\n\nThrough the Accelerating Malaria Vaccine Introduction and Roll-out in Africa (AMVIRA) initiative, WHO also supported the development of a dashboard to track readiness assessment, vaccine supply and vaccination roll-out at the national and district levels. This tool will be an asset in generating and sharing key data to better understand vaccine uptake and delivery.\n\n\"Achieving national health goals requires a collective effort. The WHO commends the Government of Sierra Leone, ministry of health, healthcare workers, community leaders, and all the partners for their tireless efforts, collaboration, and cooperation in rolling out the malaria vaccine. It is crucial that we continue to work together to ensure every child can benefit from this life-saving intervention. Through innovations like the malaria vaccine and our continued partnership, we can look forward to a future where malaria no longer threatens the lives and potential of our children\" said Dr Innocent B. Nuwagira, Representative a.i of WHO in Sierra Leone.\n\nSince 2019, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi have administered the RTS,S vaccine in a four-dose schedule to children from around five months of age as part of the pilot Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP). According to WH, more than 2 million children have been reached, with more than 6 million doses administered, resulting in a significant 13% drop in all-cause mortality in children age-eligible to receive the vaccine, and substantial reductions in severe malaria illness and hospitalizations.\n\nA total of 19 African countries are scheduled to launch the malaria vaccine this year. In addition to Sierra Leone, Benin and Liberia where vaccines have been received and are being administered.\n\nAbout Gavi\n\nGavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is a pioneering public-private partnership committed to vaccinating over half of the world's children against some of the deadliest diseases. By fostering collaboration between developing country and donor governments, alongside strategic partnerships with key stakeholders such as the WHO, UNICEF, and the vaccine industry, Gavi has played a monumental role in immunizing over 1 billion children since its inception in 2000. This collective effort has prevented more than 17.3 million future deaths and contributed to halving child mortality in 78 lower-income countries. Furthermore, Gavi's contributions extend to enhancing global health security by supporting health systems, outbreak response initiatives, and funding critical vaccine stockpiles for diseases such as Ebola, cholera, meningococcal infection, and yellow fever.\n\nFor more information about Gavi's transformative work, visit www.gavi.org and connect with us on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter.\n\nAbout UNICEF\n\nUNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children.

An extremely efficient method of preventing malaria transmission while you sleep, especially in areas where the disease is common, is to use mosquito netting coated with insecticide. By erecting a physical barrier between people and mosquitoes, these nets lower the possibility of nighttime attacks. For the nets to be as successful as possible in preventing mosquito bites and malaria infection, they must be put correctly and be free of tears. Maintaining the effectiveness of nets over time also requires regular maintenance and replacement.\n\n3. Get rid of mosquito breeding grounds: To stop mosquitoes from breeding, empty any standing water in the containers surrounding your house. This covers buckets, old tyres, flower pots, and any other water-collecting container.\n\n4. Use indoor residual spraying (IRS): If you reside in a region where malaria transmission is strong, you might think about employing IRS, which is sprinkling insecticides to kill mosquitoes on walls and ceilings of dwellings.\n\n5. Seek treatment as soon as possible: Get help right away if you experience any of the malarial symptoms, which include fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The disease cannot spread if early diagnosis and treatment are received.\n\n6. Remain in air-conditioned or well-screened lodging: Mosquitoes can readily enter rooms through unsealed windows and doors, so keep away from lodgings without sufficient screening or air conditioning.\n\n7. Speak with a healthcare provider about the best antimalarial drug options before visiting a region where malaria is endemic in order to prevent the disease. Pay close attention to the dosage that is provided, and make sure you take the prescription as prescribed even after you get home.\n\nThe length of time it takes to recover from malaria varies from person to person and is influenced by things like overall health and infection intensity. For people who have had malaria, the following general recovery advice is provided:\n\n1. Finish the prescribed course of treatment: Even if you begin to feel better before finishing the course, make sure you finish the antimalarial medication. This makes it more likely that the parasite will be completely removed from your body.\n\n2. Rest: Give your body time to relax and heal. Due to the impact on your body that malaria can have, obtain lots of rest and refrain from physically demanding activities until you feel completely better.\n\n3. Take on plenty of liquids to keep your body hydrated and aid in the removal of toxins, such as water, juices, and electrolyte solutions.\n\n4. Consume nutrient-dense foods: To aid in your body's healing and strengthen your immune system, concentrate on eating a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.\n\n5. Especially if you reside in or visit malaria-endemic areas, take precautions to avoid future mosquito bites, such as applying insect repellent, sleeping under mosquito nets, and donning protective clothes.\n\n6. It's critical to listen to your doctor's instructions and suggestions regarding medicine, rest, and follow-up appointments.", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insecticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insecticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Malaria_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Malaria Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_net", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito net"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_residual_spraying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indoor residual spraying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimalarial_medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antimalarial medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Healthy diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Mammals", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109578556,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-530932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Vulnerable groups such as young children and pregnant women face higher risks.\n\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by a parasite. It spreads through people by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. If left untreated, it can cause severe illness and even death.\n\nDr Shaarang Sachdev, Senior Consultant & Head of Emergency at Aakash Healthcare, New Delhi, stressed the importance of government involvement in malaria eradication.\n\nHe highlights key programs like the National Vector Borne Disease Control Program focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.\n\nMalaria is a major health concern in India. It is thought to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality.\n\nDespite these efforts, healthcare facilities encounter several hurdles in diagnosing and treating malaria.\n\nDr Uma Rani, Director of Pathology at Asian Hospital, Faridabad, pointed out challenges such as reliance on microscopy for diagnosis, limited access to rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and emerging drug resistance.\n\n\"Treatment is further hampered by the emergence of medication resistance. In my experience, I've seen cases where there were major problems as a result of delayed diagnosis due to a lack of diagnostic equipment. Insufficient use of important medications like improper dose and improper duration can impede timely treatment,\" Dr Uma Rani.\n\nAffordability is another concern, with treatment costs varying widely. Many in low-income communities delay treatment because of financial constraints, leading to worse health outcomes.\n\nLooking ahead, Dr Anju Wali, Medical Director at PSRI Hospital, New Delhi, added that India's Malaria Vision 2030 is an ambitious goal but requires continued commitment and innovative approaches.\n\n\"While challenges such as drug resistance and dealing with different systems remain. Political will, community engagement and adequate funding are working to achieve this vision,\" said Dr Wali.\n\nAs India strives towards a malaria-free future, it's essential to address these challenges with unwavering commitment and flexibility. Collaboration and sustained efforts will pave the way for a healthier nation.\n\nTwo vaccines for malaria, approved by the World Health Organisation, have been developed and are set to help millions of children worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anopheles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anopheles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito-borne_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mosquito-borne disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parasitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jharkhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chhattisgarh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chhattisgarh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_diagnostic_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapid diagnostic test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microscopy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faridabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Faridabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Faridabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Digestive_System_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Digestive System Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202404/malaria-vaccine--illustration-253740192-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ILxuyrsSN2N07mA02BX7Y0c6OxeBgS7U", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Stephen's is impacting access to healthcare for cross-border populations. This article highlights the need for coordinated efforts to strengthen malaria control programs, improve healthcare access, and address the root causes of the disease to advance towards malaria elimination in the region. The malaria elimination requires closely coordination between neighboring countries. Cross border coordination is important in malaria elimination settings as it strengthens surveillance, exchange knowledge and optimum use of resources. In 2020, a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding was signed between IGAD, RBM, and ALMA, outlining collaborative areas such as regional elimination goals, policy environments, resource mobilization, and coordination.\n\nA rapid assessment was conducted in the second half of 2022 to evaluate the current malaria implementation status of Member States' programs in collaboration with health experts from IGAD, RBM, and ALMA. The assessment aimed to review ongoing control, pre-elimination, and elimination efforts, identify challenges and priorities in regional bottlenecks. It proposed joint interventions for enhanced collaboration towards malaria elimination.\n\nMethod\n\nThe assessment comprised a desk review of relevant documents, key informant interviews with stakeholders, and stakeholder consultations to validate findings and recommendations for the assessment report.\n\nOutcomes and results\n\nAll IGAD countries are committed to malaria control, with varying elimination objectives. More specifically considering their malaria elimination objectives: (i) Djibouti will consider malaria elimination once universal coverage is reached, (ii) Ethiopia is targeting nationwide elimination by 2030, (iii) Kenya has a sub national elimination agenda targeting 4 counties currently under development, (iv) Somalia is aiming at a minimum of 25 districts (of 90 districts) reporting zero cases by 2025, (v) South Sudan has no Elimination objective in the strategic plan and is focusing on scaling up all interventions, (vi) Sudan is targeting 3 northern states for pre-elimination, and (vii) Uganda is establishing a system for malaria elimination in targeted districts by 2025. The rapid assessment report analyzes achievements, challenges, treatment protocols, ALMA scorecards, and grants in each country. It is also analyzing each country situation in terms of main achievements and challenges.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nProposed initiatives include the development of a Horn of Africa malaria initiative led by IGAD which aimed at generating changes against cross-border movement, spreading insecticide resistance, or insufficient intervention coverage in another country, and addressing cross-border challenges. This will enhance regional collaboration for malaria elimination. Thus, IGAD aims to create an enabling regional environment that will allow respective countries to achieve their elimination goals and accelerating progress towards a malaria-free Horn of Africa. In this regard, the national malaria managers (NMCPs) together with IGAD Secretariat have selected the 2 specific areas inline relevant for regional collaboration:\n\nDevelopment of the coordination of entomological and epidemiological surveillance in IGAD countries Synchronization of vector control intervention across member states\n\nThese projects are aligned with the IGAD Cross Border Health Policy 2021-2030 and enhance regional collaboration to accelerate progress towards a malaria-free Horn of Africa.", "source": {"uri": "reliefweb.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "ReliefWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Authority_on_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intergovernmental Authority on Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_understanding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorandum of understanding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Somalia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Somalia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djibouti", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Djibouti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Djibouti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horn of Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member states of the United Nations"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vector control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Educational_Resources/Assessment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Educational Resources/Assessment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Impact_Assessment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Impact Assessment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://reliefweb.int/modules/custom/reliefweb_meta/images/icons/Sudan_SDN.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9507943", "eventUri": "eng-9507943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Some were also provided with dental services.\n\nAccording to Mavis Nana Yaa Kyei, AngloGold Ashanti continues to be resolute in its approach towards the well-being of residents of communities in its operational areas hence will leave no stone unturned in its quest to implement the health care interventions in their 10-year Socioeconomic Development Plan.\n\n\"I call on our stakeholders including community members to help us realise this vision\", she added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Adansi South Health Director Robert Mensah has lauded AngloGold Ashanti for its Malaria Control program stressing that, together with the Directorate's internal strategies, malaria cases are on the decline in the District.\n\nHe said from 2021 to 2023, malaria cases dropped from 14,700 to 14,001. He said the Directorates has not rested on their oars in pursuing solutions to eradicate malaria in the district.\n\n\" Together with the IRS introduced by AGAMAL, we have also stepped up our community-based sensitization drive to drum home the relevance of maintaining a healthy environment to prevent the spread of Malaria. If the people adhere to all these, we will make headways in the fight against Malaria\", he ended\n\nThe Edubiahene, Oguahyia Oduropanin Birikorang I who was the chairman of the occasion spoke about measures he has put in place to fight Malaria in New Edubiase and surrounding areas.\n\nHe said recognizing the role unhealthy environment plays in breeding mosquitoes leading to the spread of Malaria, he has set up a committee which will organize periodic communal labour. He stressed that the committee is headed by an educationist who will bring students on board.\n\nNana Birikorang stressed that focusing on students for communal labour activities is deliberately done to inculcate in the children the need to maintain a hygienic environment.\n\nResidents who participated in the free screening commended AngloGold Ashanti for the Mini clinic.

Malaria can manifest with symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, and muscle aches, among others. Left untreated, it can lead to fatalities or severe complications, including organ failure in extreme cases.\n\nVisitors to endemic areas must take preventive measures like using insect repellent, sleeping under mosquito nets, and taking antimalarial drugs. Malaria symptoms typically appear 7-30 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, although in some cases, it may take up to a year. Here are the immediate symptoms of malaria to be aware of:\n\nIn a conversation with Jagran English, Dr. Sanjay Verma, a senior consultant in the Department of Internal Medicine at Max Super Speciality Hospital in Dehradun, discussed the immediate symptoms of malaria that should not be ignored.\n\nFever and chills: This is the most common symptom, often occurring in cycles, with periods of high fever followed by chills and sweating.\n\nHeadache: Generalized achiness or throbbing pain in the head is common.\n\nAlso Read: 6 Key Reasons To Add Yogurt To Your Diet For Clean Skin And Healthy Hair\n\nMuscle Aches and Pains: A feeling of general malaise and body aches may be experienced.\n\nFatigue and Weakness: Malaria can lead to extreme tiredness and a lack of energy.\n\nConfusion Or Impaired Consciousness: Seek immediate medical attention if confusion or disorientation occurs.\n\nSeizures: Convulsions can indicate severe malaria.\n\nSevere Anemia: Malaria can cause a significant decrease in red blood cells, resulting in pale skin, shortness of breath, and weakness.\n\nAlso Read: What Is PGAD, Medical Condition That Left US Woman With Permanent Arousal?\n\nDr. Sanjay emphasized that symptoms may vary depending on the species of Plasmodium. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, especially after traveling to malaria-endemic areas, seeking prompt medical attention is crucial.

Having reported zero cases for the past three years, these districts are now gearing up to achieve pre-elimination status, Principal Director and Mission Director for National Health Mission (NHM), Dr. E Motsuthung Patton said on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at a World Malaria Day event in Kohima, Dr. Patton said that despite the challenges, Nagaland has demonstrated resilience and innovation in its efforts to control and eventually eliminate malaria by 2030.\n\nAdvancements like highly sensitive rapid diagnostic tests, widespread distribution of life saving antimalarial medications, and implementation of innovative prevention and control strategies have played a crucial role in early detection and outbreak prevention in the community, he said.\n\nEmphasising the need for a comprehensive approach to combat malaria, the official said that addressing medical needs alone is insufficient to truly eradicate the disease.\n\n\"To truly overcome malaria, we must address not only its medical aspect but also the underlying social, economic and environmental determinants that perpetuate its transmission,\" he asserted.\n\nDr. Patton urged the people of the state to strengthen their commitment with more innovative community-centric approaches, investment in robust healthcare infrastructure and implement strategies that reach the most vulnerable. Continuous education, clean environments, and support for frontline healthcare workers are also crucial in this fight, he added.\n\nAcknowledging that India has made significant progress in malaria control, he said that the country has drastically reduced morbidity and mortality rates. However, he stressed that the disease still disproportionately affects vulnerable groups like pregnant women, children, and internally displaced people, and indigenous people.\n\nMalaria continues to directly endanger health and cost lives, but it also perpetuates the vicious cycle of inequity, he said, emphasising that ensuring access to prevention, detection, and treatment services for these groups is vital to achieve a malaria-free world.\n\nThe programme was led by Dr. Akuo Sorhie. Director (Health) and vote of thanks was proposed by Dr. R Chubala Aier, Additional Director and State Programme Officer (SPO) National Center for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC).\n\nThe event also recognised the efforts of healthcare workers, with awards presented to outstanding surveillance workers, Mhalerovi and Deizenuo, and ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) Kikrusi and Temsujungla, in the Kohima district.\n\nMeanwhile, the department informed that Nagaland is one of the best-performing states in the northeastern region, and the state was invited to share its best practices at a national-level program organised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in collaboration with the World Health Organisation.\n\nDeputy Director of NCVBDC, Dr. Tinurenla Anichari,

"body": "In a significant public health achievement, Nagaland has recorded zero malaria cases in eight districts in 2023 indicating a major progress in the State's fight against the vector-borne disease.\n\nHealth officials said Nagaland is one of the best performing states in the North-East region towards elimination of malaria.\n\nAccording to data from the National Center for Vector Borne Disease Control (NCVBDC), Directorate of Health & Family Welfare (DoHFW) the districts of Dimapur, Phek, Longleng, Mokokchung, Tuensang, Mon, Kiphire and Zunheboto reported zero case in 2023.\n\nThe trend data also indicated a steady reduction in malaria cases over the past six years from 20 cases in 2019 to zero case in 2024.\n\nThere were 12 positive cases reported in 2020, eight in 2021, five in 2022 and four in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the observation of the World Malaria Day scheduled to be held at the DoHFW, was shifted to the Secretariat conference due to the picketing of the directorate by the Angami Students' Union (ASU) against the appointment of non-indigenous personnel under grade-IV posts.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Principal Director cum Mission Director (NHM) H&FW, Dr E Motsuthung Patton recalled Nagaland's longstanding battle with malaria and the its devastating effects.\n\nHowever, he expressed satisfaction at the significant strides made by the State over the years towards achieving the goal of malaria elimination by 2030, attributing the success to the diligent health workers and community volunteers, particularly ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activist).\n\nHowever, Dr Patton reminded that the progress still remains fragile and challenging and underscored the need to innovate more community-centric approaches, invest in robust healthcare infrastructure, and implement strategies that reach the most vulnerable.\n\nDr Akuo Sorhie, Director (Health) remarked that it would be a crime to let anyone die of malaria stating that one need not be a doctor to save lives, and urged all to spread awareness in their vicinity.\n\nTwo award categories were presented during the event, with Mhalerovi and Diezenuo honoured in the 'Surveillance Worker' category, while Kikrusi and Temsujungla received awards under ASHA.\n\nDiscussing grassroots approach to malaria prevention on the sideline of the event, an ASHA awardee told The Morung Express,\"Our engagement primarily involves conducting Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) and distributing Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN).\"\n\nShe also informed that they (ASHAs) often go door-to-door creating awareness and one-on-one talk with the people, especially pregnant women and elderly people, while awareness camps are being organised time to time.\n\nMeanwhile, on behalf of all her colleagues, she expressed the need for the department to provide ASHA workers with sufficient disposal hand gloves and first aid kids.\n\nIt was learnt that, ASHA workers buy disposal gloves from their own pockets, and sometimes they asked from the sub-centres.\n\n\"Even if we sometimes asked from the health sub-centres, its one time use, and most of the time, we have to buy from our pockets,\" she stated.", "source": {"uri": "morungexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MorungExpress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector",

Following are some of the activities to celebrate the World Malaria Day 2024.\n\nAwareness Campaigns: World Malaria Day is an opportunity to educate people about the importance of using bed nets, indoor residual spraying, and seeking prompt medical care for suspected cases of Malaria. It is also a day to raise awareness about the mosquito-borne virus, and the need for an integrated approach to Malaria prevention and treatment. This can be done through community awareness campaigns.\n\nCommunity Events: One can participate in World Malaria Day by organising community events such as workshops, seminars, or health fairs to educate people about Malaria prevention, symptoms, and treatment. This can also be done by distributing insecticide-treated bed nets to communities at risk of Malaria transmission.\n\nSet up Mobile Clinics: Another way to participate in World Malaria Day is to set up mobile clinics or partner with local healthcare facilities to offer free Malaria screenings and diagnostic tests in high-risk areas.

Beginning with chloroquine, resistance has compromised the efficacies of most major classes of antimalarial drugs. Partial resistance to artemisinin (ART-R) is becoming a major threat to the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and intravenous artesunate, which are critical for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria, respectively. Already ubiquitous throughout the Greater Mekong subregion of Southeast Asia, ART-R has emerged in several countries in eastern Africa. For the prevention of a potential public health disaster in sub-Saharan Africa, the time for decisive action to confront emerging ART-R is now.\n\nACTs, which include a fast-acting artemisinin derivative and a longer-lasting partner drug, were globally adopted as first-line therapy for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in the early 2000s. In Africa, ACT partner drugs are mainly lumefantrine or amodiaquine. The current evolution of ART-R in eastern Africa recalls the earlier situation in Southeast Asia, which within less than a decade saw ART-R dominate parasite populations. ART-R is mediated mainly by mutations that alter the P. falciparum Kelch13 (K13) protein propeller domain, and it manifests clinically as delayed parasite clearance in patients treated with an artemisinin derivative or an ACT. In Africa, ART-R has been confirmed in Rwanda, Eritrea, Uganda and Tanzania, where multiple validated or candidate K13 ART-R mutant variants have been observed (including R561H, R622I, C469Y/C469F, A675V and P441L). ART-R associated with mutant K13 is also suspected in Ethiopia and Sudan. These data from Africa provide clear evidence of multiple independent origins of artemisinin-resistant parasites, which indicates that containment and control measures will need to be implemented on multiple fronts.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, valuable lessons were learned from the largely successful containment of ART-R and resistance to ACT partner drugs, achieved mainly by effective control of malaria transmission, including improvements in drug treatment monitoring, vector control, surveillance and community engagement. Bodies such as the Regional Artemisinin Resistance Initiative and the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network were established and have ensured continued regional collaboration and the sharing of information, resources and strategies. The strategy for mitigating ART-R in Africa, recently issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), is designed to catalyze a rapid, concerted response. The strategy recommends four concomitant pillars: improving surveillance for resistance and monitoring of drug efficacy; optimizing and better regulating the use of diagnostics and therapeutics to limit drug pressure; reacting to resistance by limiting the spread of antimalarial-drug-resistant parasites; and catalyzing research and innovation to better leverage existing tools and to develop new tools against resistance. Each pillar needs to be tailored to the local in-country context. However, without an urgent global consensus on declaring ART-R an emergency, and without the necessary concomitant financing and regional coordination, little progress has been made toward operationalizing the WHO strategy.\n\nActions are needed now. First, given the experience in Southeast Asia, political will and commitment are needed to urgently take on the challenge of ART-R in Africa. At a global level, substantial commitment to empowering knowledgeable public health management, including financial support, is needed to tackle the problem holistically. The WHO Global Malaria Programme is critical for ensuring standardized data collection, efficient information flow and a coordinated response. Governments in the resistance hotspots and beyond need to acknowledge the urgency of the issue and to agree to coordinated actions both individually and regionally. Advocacy and buy-in from governments and global malaria partners will allow increased resources and technical expertise to enable updated treatment guidelines based on emerging resistance patterns. Regional coordinating mechanisms, with rapid sharing of standardized and validated data, knowledge and experience, will be critical.\n\nSecond, surveillance of disease, Anopheles mosquito vectors and interventions must be strengthened; this should include genomic platforms, therapeutic efficacy studies and parasite phenotypic analyses to monitor the spread of resistant parasites and assess the impacts of antimalarial mitigation efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a major expansion in available laboratory capacity in Africa. Investment is needed to negotiate costs of reagents and equipment, establish norms and processes for data generation and sharing, and develop the capacity to translate molecular, clinical and parasitology data into policy decisions.\n\nThird, a more tailored approach to malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa must be implemented, akin to elimination efforts in other regions, whereby suitable packages of interventions are selected to target malaria at the subnational level within specific ART-R risk populations. Targeting should focus on infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic, across all ages), should be guided by data and should combine multiple interventions, including vector control, case management, chemoprevention, vaccination, and social and behavioral change communication. Priority interventions can include the tailored deployment of triple or sequential ACTs or multiple first-line therapies. The addition of transmission-blocking drugs, such as single low-dose primaquine, may help reduce the spread of ART-R. Access to vaccines against malaria (RTS/S or R21), including their use in combination with chemoprevention, is expanding for at-risk young children, and ideally will later expand to older age groups. As learned from the response to COVID-19, the development of non-artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs and other prevention tools such as monoclonal antibodies must be accelerated.\n\nFourth, local stakeholders and affected communities must be empowered to identify operational challenges and, with technical support, design solutions to overcome these challenges. Leadership at the local level is needed to understand the reasons for the failure of malaria control in a particular geography and what response will be suitable to prevent the spread of ART-R. Effective engagement with local communities is an essential element of the comprehensive strategy for ART-R mitigation.\n\nFifth, as described in the WHO mitigation strategy for ART-R in Africa, basic, operational and implementation research must be enhanced to address key questions of high relevance to control and elimination programs. These include efforts to identify mediators of the resistance of P. falciparum to partner drugs. Recent reports suggest that parasites with lower susceptibility to lumefantrine are already circulating in Uganda, where K13 variants are now present. Increased national and regional collaboration by research, health and other relevant sectors needs programmatic support to accelerate the identification of the drivers of resistance and to mitigate their impact.\n\nART-R has emerged in Africa. The public health community must not stand by and watch resistance spread unchecked, morbidity and mortality increase, and years of investment in improved malaria control be lost. The warning lights are on amber; the world cannot afford to wait for the lights to turn red. The right tools to be proactive rather than reactive are available. Now is the time for action with a well-resourced and coordinated global response.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

These cannot and should not go unacknowledged, despite the continued challenges we face both at home and on the world stage.\n\nOn a personal level, I'm immensely proud of my role in the banning of child marriage in England and Wales which, with support from the Government, was enacted through my Private Member's Bill. This became law in February and it fills me with pride to leave such an important legislative change on the statute books to protect some of the most vulnerable.\n\nI'm also indebted to my constituents in Mid-Derbyshire, for whom I defended Derby County FC during its administration, worked with local businesses such as Rolls-Royce, and campaigned to make Derby the headquarters of Great British Railways.\n\nOn the world stage, I've been fortunate to serve on the International Development Select Committee alongside diligent and inspiring colleagues to promote girls' education, eradicate disease, and increase clean water supply around the globe.\n\nWe played a significant role in formulating the Sustainable Development Goals between 2013 and 2015, which have since helped to guide the sector and inspire us to go further and faster.\n\nThese positive changes have come about in no small part through British leadership and they risk disintegrating without it.\n\nWith today being World Malaria Day, we can take this disease as a case study.\n\nMalaria is a disease I know well from my many visits to Africa, where the vast bulk of cases are. My trips included a summit in the Kigali Summit on Malaria and STDs in 2022 where I saw first-hand the work of organisations like the Global Fund.\n\nThis year sees the continued rollout of one vaccine and likely rollout of a second, both of which are largely due to the efforts of British scientists backed by the British government.\n\nBut without continued ministerial support, this progress will slip. The impact of COVID-19 in particular has led the World Health Organisation to state just last year that progress \"has stalled\" on malaria according to the World Malaria Report last year.\n\nThis is why the Conservative Party must continue its commitment to ending malaria and being a leader in international development in its next election manifesto.\n\nWhilst the outcome of this election may be uncertain, re-committing to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official development assistance is guaranteed to reaffirm this country's status as global leader and secure our party's legacy as a pioneer in international aid.\n\nAnd we need not look far for inspiration: The Conservative Party Manifesto in 2019 both committed to \"proudly maintain\" 0.7 per cent of GNI on development and to \"end the preventable deaths of mothers, new-born babies, and children by 2030, and lead the way in eradicating Ebola and malaria.\"\n\nI hope that my Conservative colleagues can rekindle this ambition and see the many global challenges we now face as providing all the more reason for doing so, rather than an excuse not to.", "source": {"uri": "conservativehome.com",

It\u2019s been a week since Donald Trump\u2019s 34-count conviction was handed down, and Melania Trump has kept a relatively low profile \u2014 until now. On Tuesday, the former first lady and 18-year-old son Barron were spotted exiting Trump Tower in Manhattan. It was a very stylish and expensive fashion moment for the duo, who stepped into the family SUV on their way to the former president\u2019s Bedminster, New Jersey estate. More from SheKnows Melania wasn\u2019t interested in leaning into the quiet luxury trend that\u2019s all the rage right now. Instead, she screamed opulence in her chic $1,345 Max Mara jumpsuit in a soft brown. (See the photos HERE.) She accessorized her casually elegant style with a Herm\u00e8s Kelly bag and Roger Vivier ballet flats, totaling almost $18,000, per Page Six. As she and Barron entered the vehicle, the Trump Tower staff members loaded a stack of Louis Vuitton luggage into the trunk. If you think this outfit wasn\u2019t planned, think again. The former first lady was subliminally sending a message that she\u2019s unbothered by her husband\u2019s conviction and the possible jail sentence that awaits him. She\u2019s leaning into the family\u2019s outward image of wealth with an outfit that looks effortless and breezy. While Forbes estimates Donald Trump\u2019s net worth to be $7.5 billion as of May 2, 2024, he has astronomical legal bills and judgments against him that will impact his finances. He is currently appealing a $455 million judgment from the New York business fraud case, and he owes former Elle writer, E. Jean Carroll $88 million from two defamation cases after she claimed he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s. Even though Donald Trump claimed on Fox & Friends Weekend on Sunday that Melania was \u201cfine\u201d in the wake of his hush money conviction, the former president admitted that behind closed doors it\u2019s been hard. \u201cIt\u2019s tougher, I think it\u2019s probably in many ways, it\u2019s tougher on my family than it is on me,\u201d he said. \u201c[Melania is] fine, but I think it\u2019s very hard for her. I mean, she\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s, you know, she has to read all this crap.\u201d But Melania and Donald Trump don\u2019t want to give off vibes that they are bothered by his legal issues because he\u2019s trying to win a presidential election. One way to achieve that is through fashion messaging, which is exactly what Melania is doing. In public, she\u2019s unbothered and living her luxurious life in peace. In private, it might be something very, very different. Before you go, click here to see the biggest presidential scandals in US History. Best of SheKnows Sign up for SheKnows' Newsletter.

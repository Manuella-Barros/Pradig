{"id": 225010630, "title": "New Thorn Primary School could open on grounds of existing Johnstone facility in 2028", "text": "A new Thorn Primary School \u2013 a subject that was previously dubbed the \"talk of the steamie\" in Johnstone \u2013 could open in 2028. Renfrewshire Council will fund the replacement facility at a cost of around \u00a314 million and hope to build it on the same site in Thorn Brae. A report to the education and children's services policy board on Thursday reiterated the project remains at the \"very early stages\" but set out the estimated delivery date. Initial engagement has been organised to make sure views are heard and can be \"appropriately implemented\" into the design of the school where possible. Councillor Gillian Graham, Labour group education spokesperson and representative for Johnstone North and the surrounding villages, said: \"It's really good to see an update on Thorn. The fact that we're looking at a 2028 opening is good to see and I also welcome the fact there will be consultation with the staff and broader school community.\" Councillor Iain McMillan, Labour group leader and representative for Johnstone South and Elderslie, had earlier this year described the plans for a new school as the \"talk of the steamie\" in the town. Speaking last week, he added: \"Certainly I welcome what's happening with Thorn Primary School and look forward to hearing what both the school community and local community think about any possible developments there.\" Gerry Lyons, interim head of education, responded: \"A team from the council are going to meet with the staff on June 3 to listen to their views on the design of the school and any issues that they want us to keep abreast of as we look at the design of the school. \"That same team of staff will go and meet with the parent council on June 11 and again take them through the thinking, the plans insofar as they exist at the moment and again hear from them on any particular concerns either about the process or the outcome, so that we keep them on board in terms of the management of the project and the delivery of the school.\" Don't miss the latestRenfrewshire headlines \u2013sign up to our free daily newsletter here", "summary": "Renfrewshire Council will fund the project at a cost of around \u00a314 million and hope to build in Thorn Brae.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/in-your-area/renfrewshire/new-thorn-primary-school-could-32913851", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article30670815.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_DNP_PDE_290317thorn_03JPG.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:26:25", "author": "Jack Thomson", "authors": ["Jack Thomson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.103}

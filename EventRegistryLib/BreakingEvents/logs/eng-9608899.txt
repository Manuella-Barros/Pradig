Several thirdparty hopefuls are also running.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 in what looks set to be a divisive, closely fought contest. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.\n\nIn office from 2017-2021, Trump has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nTrump, 77, has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies.\n\nHe calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric. He has refused to commit to accepting the election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest, and is already laying the groundwork to contest his potential election loss.\n\nTrump faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing in all the cases, including the ongoing New York hush-money criminal trial that could be the only one to begin before the Nov. 5 election, and called the charges a Democratic conspiracy to prevent him from winning. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference.\n\nIf elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that did not spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course.\n\nTrump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals\" and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil.\n\nOn abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and has said it should remain a state issue. While he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as those in Florida and Arizona, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans. Trump has also sent differing messages on birth control access.\n\nHe promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it, and he has pledged to halt federal funding to schools with vaccine mandates. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration's work to fight climate change.\n\nTrump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated with some attending his New York trial. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nBiden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nHe faced no serious challenger for the Democratic nomination, which he clinched in March.\n\nNovember's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting both Biden and Trump's voter support at 40% of registered voters. Other polling shows the incumbent trailing Trump in crucial battleground states.\n\nBiden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years his junior, while combating low approval ratings that are worse among younger than older voters.\n\nThe economy will also factor in Biden's reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters' minds.\n\nBiden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far. His campaign has highlighted new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plansand other economic efforts, while Biden has said pushed competition with China, keeping tariffs put in place by Trump while ratcheting up others. Two labor groups, the United Auto Workers union and the North America's Building Trade Union, have endorsed him.\n\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris, he has unveiled a new coalition to court Black voters, a critical voting bloc that has historically voted for Democrats but is showing signs of weakness for the party.\n\nBiden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs.\n\nHe has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv, and secured additional funding in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans.\n\nBiden has also provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas while urging more humanitarian assistance, but he faces growing criticism from many Democrats over his handling of the war in Gaza. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows the issue has divided the party. While he paused a shipment of certain bombs to Israel amid continued efforts to pursue a ceasefire, Israel has pressed ahead in Rafah.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON\n\nBest-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out before voting began.\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhile he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with a May Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 13% of respondents.\n\nThe son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden.\n\nKennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry.\n\nKennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\"\n\nHe has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them. He himself had a brain worm more than a decade ago but has fully recovered, according to his campaign.\n\nKennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, although he faces a challenging, costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but, in October, he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 74, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.\n\nWhile the Libertarian Party invited both Trump and Kennedy to speak at their convention in late May, it ultimately selected Chase Oliver, who ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [],

By Reuters", "body": "(Reuters) -President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 in what looks set to be a divisive, closely fought contest. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.\n\nIn office from 2017-2021, Trump has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years.\n\nTrump, 77, has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies.\n\nHe calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric. He has refused to commit to accepting the election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest, and is already laying the groundwork to contest his potential election loss.\n\nTrump faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing in all the cases, including the ongoing New York hush-money criminal trial that could be the only one to begin before the Nov. 5 election, and called the charges a Democratic conspiracy to prevent him from winning. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference.\n\nIf elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that did not spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course.\n\nTrump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals\" and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil.\n\nOn abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and has said it should remain a state issue. While he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as those in Florida and Arizona, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans. Trump has also sent differing messages on birth control access.\n\nHe promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it, and he has pledged to halt federal funding to schools with vaccine mandates. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration's work to fight climate change.\n\nTrump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated with some attending his New York trial. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nBiden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nHe faced no serious challenger for the Democratic nomination, which he clinched in March.\n\nNovember's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting both Biden and Trump's voter support at 40% of registered voters. Other polling shows the incumbent trailing Trump in crucial battleground states.\n\nBiden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years his junior, while combating low approval ratings that are worse among younger than older voters.\n\nThe economy will also factor in Biden's reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters' minds.\n\nBiden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far. His campaign has highlighted new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plansand other economic efforts, while Biden has said pushed competition with China, keeping tariffs put in place by Trump while ratcheting up others. Two labor groups, the United Auto Workers union and the North America's Building Trade Union, have endorsed him.\n\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris, he has unveiled a new coalition to court Black voters, a critical voting bloc that has historically voted for Democrats but is showing signs of weakness for the party.\n\nBiden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs.\n\nHe has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv, and secured additional funding in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans.\n\nBiden has also provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas while urging more humanitarian assistance, but he faces growing criticism from many Democrats over his handling of the war in Gaza. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows the issue has divided the party. While he paused a shipment of certain bombs to Israel amid continued efforts to pursue a ceasefire, Israel has pressed ahead in Rafah.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON\n\nBest-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out.\n\nIn a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out before voting began.\n\nAn anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhile he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with a May Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 13% of respondents.\n\nThe son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden.\n\nKennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry.\n\nKennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\"\n\nHe has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them. He himself had a brain worm more than a decade ago but has fully recovered, according to his campaign.\n\nKennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, although he faces a challenging, costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nCORNEL WEST\n\nThe political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but, in October, he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing.\n\nJill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place.\"\n\nStein, 74, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.\n\nWhile the Libertarian Party invited both Trump and Kennedy to speak at their convention in late May, it ultimately selected Chase Oliver, who ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"},

That's not a slight, and it isn't \"fake news.\" It is an indisputable fact.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has a proven track record - of not winning. That's not a slight, and it isn't \"fake news.\" It is an indisputable fact.\n\nIn 2000, Trump first entered politics running as a Reform Party candidate - although he had considered a run for president as early as 1987 - and he received more than 15,000 votes in the party's California primary, only to bow out of the race after he found the party to be too dysfunctional.\n\nJust as he began hosting the reality show The Apprentice for NBC, Trump mulled a run for the White House in 2004 but opted not to follow through. Due in part to the popularity of the show, Trump topped a list of Republican Party contenders in a March 2011 Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, but again, Trump opted not to throw his hat into the ring.\n\nIt was only in February 2015 after Trump decided not to renew his contract with NBC that rumors circulated he would be run for president. There has been speculation it was a stunt to convince the network to increase his contract given the popularity of the show. In June 2015, Trump arguably crossed the proverbial Rubicon, when he announced he was running for president - during which he made disparaging comments about Mexicans. That resulted in several partnerships - including Macy's, NBC, and Univision - severing ties.\n\nTrump went on to win the 2016 Republican nomination for president. In the general election, he received the most votes in the Electoral College, yet lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump has also shown to have a long history of not accepting the results of an election and called Barack Obama's 2012 reelection a \"sham\" and suggested \"We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!\"\n\nDuring the 2016 primary season, Trump also made the unsubstantiated claim that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas \"stole\" victory in the Iowa caucus. In the run-up to the general election, Trump went on to suggest Hillary Clinton's campaign was rigging the election.\n\nEven after Secretary Clinton conceded, Trump attempted to make the dubious claim he won the popular vote, stating, \"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally!\"\n\nIn addition to being defeated by Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, Trump also saw the candidates he backed largely coming up losers in the 2018 midterms. Democrats flipped 40 seats and took back the House of Representatives. Exit polling suggested there was an unusually high level of opposition to Trump, which in turn fueled record turnout.\n\nTwo years later, Trump became the first incumbent to lose a reelection bid since George H.W. Bush in 1992, although Trump refused to concede and called the election rigged. That commentary likely also cost the GOP control of the U.S. Senate, which came down to a pair of runoff races in Georgia.\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, Trump-backed candidates - including Herschel Walker in Georgia, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, and Blake Masters - all failed to win their respective races, resulting in the Democrats keeping control of the Senate, while the GOP only retook the House of Representatives by a narrow margin.\n\nThough Trump has already secured the GOP nomination for the 2024 election - and did so without taking part in a single Republican debate, proving the rest of the field just wasted their time and donor's money - he could still struggle to win when it counts in November. That is because winning the base doesn't ensure victory. Trump narrowly won the presidency eight years ago, and if voter turnout is strong, which would favor Biden, he may go down as a loser once again.\n\nPeter Suciu is a Michigan-based writer.

If the candidates are too close to determine a winner, the votes are categorized as \"toss up.\"\n\nDDHQ currently has Trump slated to win 235 electoral votes against Biden's 226. That leaves 77 electoral votes, and the presidency, up for grabs.\n\nArizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are the six toss-up states. DDHQ currently predicts that Trump will win all but Michigan, which leans slightly in Biden's favor. In this scenario, Trump would win 297 electoral votes compared to Biden's 241.\n\nHowever, because the toss-up races are so close. DDHQ's current Electoral College prediction is more cautious, with Trump winning 282-256 over Biden.\n\nThe forecast is a welcome sign for the Trump campaign. A reputable election source, DDHQ's prediction is not one to be looked over.\n\nIts final 2020 election forecast was fairly accurate, predicting Biden would defeat Trump 318-220 in the Electoral College, only slightly off of the final tally of 306-232.\n\nHowever, DDHQ did swing and miss on a few predictions. It predicted that Biden would take Florida and North Carolina, both of which went to Trump. Other than that, the models were pretty spot on.\n\nYet, whatever optimism the Trump campaign feels should be cautioned. After all, there's still over five months until Americans go to the ballot boxes in November.\n\nAnd if the last two election cycles have taught us anything, it's that a surprise immediately before the election (think the James Comey investigation into Hilary Clinton and the suppression of Hunter Biden's laptop) is not out of the question.\n\nStill, this model shows discontent with the Biden administration's governance over the last three years, to the point where Americans are likely to replace him with arguably the most polarizing and ridiculed president in American history.\n\nIt'll be more interesting to see how the forecast changes after Trump and Biden square off in the first presidential debate on June 27, hosted by CNN.\n\nThe first meeting since the final 2020 presidential debate almost four years ago is sure to produce fireworks, as both men have more ammunition than ever against each other thanks to the last four years.\n\nTrump will surely attack Biden's economic failures, foreign policy disasters, open border policies, and energy records, while Biden will pound Trump over the abundance of legal issues the former president has faced since leaving office.\n\nAt the same time, both Trump and Biden have been in the public spotlight for so long that it's hard to imagine large swaths of the public changing their opinion on either man at this point.\n\nNonetheless, the election is far from over, and the path to the White House is paved with little room for errors. However, if the status quo remains unchanged, Trump could very well end up back in the White House.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"},

The trial could also result in a hung jury or a not guilty verdict.\n\nWhile generally speaking, running against a convicted felon could be a political gift, the Biden campaign is unlikely to dramatically alter its messaging if the jurors find Trump guilty, a senior campaign official told ABC News.\n\nMORE: Trump trial live updates: Trump says 'Mother Teresa could not beat these charges' as jury deliberates\n\nThe only way to stop Trump is at the ballot box, the official said, that Trump's future is up to voters, not the court.\n\nBiden has largely made just in-passing references to his opponent's trial.\n\nOn the first day of the trial, in April, when a reporter asked Biden if he would watch coverage of the proceedings, the president shook his head, \"no.\"\n\nTwo days later, while discussing Trump's economic record at a Pittsburgh event, Biden noted that his predecessor \"is busy right now\" -- a reference to the ongoing trial.\n\nThat same week, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the president criticized Trump's treatment of women, a possible veiled reference to the trial, where Stormy Daniels, the pornstar Trump paid off, described leaving a sexual interaction with Trump \"shaking.\" Trump has long denied the sexual encounter.\n\nSpeaking about being put on a most-eligible bachelors list after his first wife died, Biden said, \"Unlike the guy running, I didn't take advantage of any [women].\"\n\nAs Biden and Trump challenged the other to debate, Biden said he know Trump was \"free on Wednesdays\" -- a dig that stemmed from Trump's hush money trial not being in session on Wednesdays. Biden's campaign even sold \"Free on Wednesdays\" t-shirts.\n\nAsked on Wednesday how much attention Biden has paid to the Trump trial as jurors deliberate, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she hadn't spoken to the president about it.\n\n\"The president is focused on the American people -- delivering for the American people,\" Jean-Pierre said in response.\n\nBiden campaign aides have been similarly coy.\n\n\"Through sunny days and stormy nights, Joe Biden's campaign isn't about fighting through his own trials, tribulations and personal grievances,\" James Singer, a campaign spokesman, wrote in a statement during the trial's opening week.\n\nMORE: Robert De Niro, former police officers slam Trump outside New York hush money trial\n\nThe campaign broke precedent this week, however, dispatching actor Robert De Niro and two former police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to downtown Manhattan to speak to reporters near the courthouse.\n\n\"I love this city.

Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he can destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\nMichael Tyler, a campaign communications director for the Biden campaign, nevertheless tried to distance the press conference from the trial.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" he said, pointing to the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are.\"\n\nABC News' Mary Bruce contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mother Teresa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EioPj8a4mcO3MirL6bI5ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.gma.com/805ebb31880c9f80752b54cc5f2de77d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9608899", "eventUri": "eng-9608899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Biden seeks to defend democracy, while Trump aims for a comeback amidst legal challenges. Third-party candidates, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, add intrigue to the race.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will face each other in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5 in what looks set to be a divisive, closely fought contest. Several third-party hopefuls are also running.\n\nHere is a list of the candidates: REPUBLICAN PARTY\n\nDONALD TRUMP In office from 2017-2021, Trump has secured enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination, setting up the first presidential rematch in nearly 70 years. Trump, 77, has leveraged his unprecedented legal challenges to solidify support among his base and has cast his third bid for the White House in part as retribution against perceived political enemies. He calls supporters jailed for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol \"hostages\" and campaigns using increasingly dystopian rhetoric. He has refused to commit to accepting the election results or to rule out possible violence around the Nov. 5 contest, and is already laying the groundwork to contest his potential election loss.\n\nTrump faces 88 charges in four criminal cases over efforts to subvert the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving office and alleged efforts to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star. He denies wrongdoing in all the cases, including the ongoing New York hush-money criminal trial that could be the only one to begin before the Nov. 5 election, and called the charges a Democratic conspiracy to prevent him from winning. The U.S. Justice Department denies any political interference. If elected to another four-year term, Trump has vowed revenge on his political enemies and said he would not be a dictator except \"on day one,\" later calling that \"a joke.\" He also wants the power to replace federal civil service workers with loyalists. On foreign policy, Trump sparked criticism from Western leaders for saying the U.S. would not defend NATO members that did not spend enough on defense and would encourage Russia to attack them. He also pressed congressional Republicans to stall military aid for Ukraine before later reversing course. Trump has made immigration his top domestic campaign issue, declaring he would carry out mass deportations, utilize the National Guard and possibly federal troops, end birthright citizenship and expand a travel ban on people from certain countries. He has referred to migrants as \"animals\" and has not ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil. On abortion, Trump takes credit for the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade and has said it should remain a state issue. While he has criticized some Republican-led state actions such as those in Florida and Arizona, he said he would allow Republican-led states to track women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate their state bans. Trump has also sent differing messages on birth control access. He promised to eliminate Obamacare health insurance before saying in an April 11 video that he would not \"terminate\" it, and he has pledged to halt federal funding to schools with vaccine mandates. He has also vowed to undo much of the Biden administration's work to fight climate change. Trump has yet to announce a vice presidential running mate, but several possibilities have been floated with some attending his New York trial. Mike Pence, who ran alongside Trump in 2016 and 2020 but was targeted by Trump and his supporters amid the Jan. 6 attack, refused to endorse him in November's contest.\n\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY JOE BIDEN Biden launched his 2020 candidacy as an urgent bid to defend American liberties and protect democracy and has cast his reelection bid in the same light, saying Trump threatens the future of American democracy.\n\nHe faced no serious challenger for the Democratic nomination, which he clinched in March. November's election will be much tougher, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll putting both Biden and Trump's voter support at 40% of registered voters. Other polling shows the incumbent trailing Trump in crucial battleground states. Biden, already the oldest U.S. president ever at 81, must convince voters he is more fit for office than Trump, who is just four years his junior, while combating low approval ratings that are worse among younger than older voters. The economy will also factor in Biden's reelection campaign. While the U.S. escaped an anticipated recession and is growing faster than economists expected, inflation and the cost of essentials are weighing on voters' minds. Biden pushed through massive economic stimulus and infrastructure spending packages to boost U.S. industrial output, but has received little recognition from voters so far. His campaign has highlighted new semiconductor manufacturing plants, housing plansand other economic efforts, while Biden has said pushed competition with China, keeping tariffs put in place by Trump while ratcheting up others. Two labor groups, the United Auto Workers union and the North America's Building Trade Union, have endorsed him. With Vice President Kamala Harris, he has unveiled a new coalition to court Black voters, a critical voting bloc that has historically voted for Democrats but is showing signs of weakness for the party. Biden's handling of immigration policy has been criticized by Republicans and some Democrats as migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border hit record highs. He has led the response of Western governments to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persuading allies to punish Russia and support Kyiv, and secured additional funding in April after a months-long battle with congressional Republicans. Biden has also provided military aid to Israel in its conflict with Hamas while urging more humanitarian assistance, but he faces growing criticism from many Democrats over his handling of the war in Gaza. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows the issue has divided the party. While he paused a shipment of certain bombs to Israel amid continued efforts to pursue a ceasefire, Israel has pressed ahead in Rafah.\n\nMARIANNE WILLIAMSON Best-selling author and self-help guru Marianne Williamson, 71, relaunched her long-shot 2024 presidential bid focusing on \"justice and love\" less than one month after dropping out. In a February statement, she said she was getting back in to fight Trump's \"dark and authoritarian vision\" after earlier suspending it because she was losing \"the horse race.\"\n\nWilliamson previously ran as a Democrat in the 2020 presidential primary but dropped out before voting began. INDEPENDENTS\n\nROBERT F. KENNEDY JR An anti-vaccine activist and environmental advocate, Kennedy, 70, is running as an independent after initially challenging Biden for the Democratic nomination. While he lags in overall polling, Kennedy could siphon votes from Trump and Biden, with a May Reuters/Ipsos poll showing he was backed by 13% of respondents. The son of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1968 during his own presidential bid, Kennedy has drawn rebukes from his famous family, which has publicly backed Biden. Kennedy, who chose wealthy lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, supports Israel and has questioned a six-week ceasefire backed by Biden.\n\nHe said he views the U.S. southern border situation as a humanitarian crisis and opposes Trump's border wall. He has also vowed to repeal parts of Biden's climate bill over tax breaks he says help the oil industry. Kennedy has taken different positions on abortion rights, including restrictions on when a woman can access an abortion. He told Reuters he thought every abortion was a \"tragedy\" but that it should be a woman's right \"throughout the pregnancy.\" He has been criticized for making false medical claims over the years on vaccines but says he would still allow Americans to have access to them. He himself had a brain worm more than a decade ago but has fully recovered, according to his campaign. Kennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in a handful of states so far, including California, Michigan and Utah, although he faces a challenging, costly battle to be listed in all 50.\n\nCORNEL WEST The political activist, philosopher and academic is making a third-party bid for president that is most likely to appeal to progressive, Democratic-leaning voters.\n\nWest, 70, initially ran as a Green Party candidate but, in October, he said people \"want good policies over partisan politics\" and announced his bid as an independent. He has promised to end poverty and guarantee housing. GREEN PARTY\n\nJILL STEIN Jill Stein, a physician who ran under the Green Party in 2016, is trying once again in 2024.\n\nShe launched her current campaign accusing Democrats of betraying their promises \"for working people, youth and the climate again and again - while Republicans don't even make such promises in the first place.\" Stein, 74, raised millions of dollars for recounts after Trump's surprise 2016 victory. Her allegations yielded only one electoral review in Wisconsin, which showed Trump had won.\n\nLIBERTARIAN PARTY CHASE OLIVER While the Libertarian Party invited both Trump and Kennedy to speak at their convention in late May, it ultimately selected Chase Oliver, who ran for a Georgia state Senate seat in 2022 and garnered 2% of the vote.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Capitalizing on Biden's losses in New York and among Black and Latino voters, Trump campaigned in the Bronx last week, his first major rally since 2016 in New York City. The Siena poll found Biden has lost 20 points in New York City and Trump has gained seven since 2020, though Biden is still leading there by 26 points.\n\nImproving education, strengthening the economy and making social security financially sound are the top three priorities, in that order, for Black voters in the 2024 election, among a range of issues the Pew survey asked about.\n\nBiden Vs.

The former president has long claimed without evidence that prosecutors and other officials are actually targeting his reelection bid as he faces four sets of criminal charges.\n\nAs if to brace voters for a guilty verdict in his New York case, Trump added: \"Mother Teresa could not beat those charges, but we'll see. We'll see how we do.\"\n\nTrump to hit campaign trail full-time\n\nTrump has suggested that even a guilty verdict might conceivably help him because \"the people of the country see this as a rigged deal.\"\n\nThe trial itself started in mid-April and so far does not seem to have hurt Trump much. The former president is leading Biden slightly in many polls nationwide and in battleground states, although most of those leads are within margins of error.\n\nTrump and aides have declined to discuss the specifics of their post-verdict campaign plan except to say it will involve making up for lost time in terms of rallies and fundraisers, of which a bulk of the money coming into his political committee coffers has gone toward lawyer fees.\n\nOne pivotal event is already on both candidates' schedules: A June 27 debate at a CNN studio in Atlanta.\n\nBiden and the 'unique threat' of Trump\n\nBiden and his aides have also been circumspect about how they plan to handle the post-verdict campaign, only that it will involve all of the many allegations of misconduct against Trump.\n\nThe Biden team offered a preview of its strategy Tuesday with an event at the downtown courthouse where Trump is on trial.\n\nIt featured Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro and two Capitol Hill police officers who were injured in the pro-Trump insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone. They accused Trump of being a would-be dictator who is willing to encourage violence to get his way.\n\nTrump also faces future trials over Jan. 6-related charges, as well as his questionable handling of classified documents.\n\nBiden officials were careful to say they didn't want to comment on the hush money trial and held the event at the courthouse because so many reporters were stationed there.\n\nMichael Taylor, the Biden team's communications director, said the campaign wants to stress what he called \"the unique threat that Donald Trump poses to our democracy.\"\n\nVoters also wait for the jury\n\nAlso waiting anxiously: Pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators outside the courthouse.\n\n\"I know he's not going to be acquitted - I'm praying for a hung jury,\" said Joe Palau, 57, a pro-Trump construction worker from Brooklyn.\n\nNadine Seiler, 59, who carried a large sign that said \"Convict Trump Already!\" expressed the same concern in a different context.\n\n\"I am very concerned about a hung jury,\" said Seiler, a home organizer who took the bus to New York from her home in Waldorf, Maryland.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump and Biden teams

Crisp, an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service, lives in Texas and can be reached at jcrispcolumns@gmail.com\n\nSomehow the undesired appears to have become the inevitable.\n\nIn January, 76% of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll said that President Joe Biden should not seek reelection, and 56% said that former President Donald Trump should not run.\n\nNevertheless, unless something drastic occurs, in six months America will endure a replay of the 2020 election. Count me among the many who wish we had different candidates.\n\nOn the other hand, this rematch provides an opportunity to experience something that is comparatively rare in politics, and in life, for that matter: unalloyed clarity.\n\nIn fact, this election will tell us a lot about who we are as a nation.\n\nThe choice between Biden and Trump could not be more stark. Some of the difference between them has to do with policy. If you favor abortion rights, you'll probably vote for Biden; if you favor gun rights, Trump is your candidate. If you think climate change is a threat: Biden; if you think it's a hoax: Trump.\n\nBut something about this election feels much more fundamental than is suggested by the ordinary differences of opinion that voters have about taxes and tariffs or immigration and inequality.\n\nIn fact, the traditional big-government-versus-small- government tension that has characterized American politics since our founding seems almost irrelevant as we flirt with a different sort of government altogether.\n\nThis part of the conflict is difficult to describe without betraying my preference for one candidate over the other, so I might as well come clean: I will be voting for Biden. If you're planning to vote for Trump, you and I probably disagree on the quality of Biden's term, but those are the legitimate points of contention inherent in ordinary politics.\n\nStill, I'd contend that Biden is a conventional, left-leaning (not a communist, however!) politician and administrator who's performing at an above-average level in very difficult circumstances. The idea that his administration is a disaster is pure campaign hyperbole.\n\nIs he too old? Maybe. But he's far from a senile, doddering fool. And if he doesn't survive four more years in office, that's what vice presidents are for. (Kamala Harris' \"inadequacies\" are campaign hyperbole, as well.)\n\nBut Donald Trump is not merely Joe Biden's conservative counterpart. He brings something entirely new into American politics. If you're already a committed Trump voter, you may not like this part, but it's difficult to deny that it's accurate.\n\nThe ways in which Trump is different from Biden are myriad, but here are two:\n\nAll presidents lie at some point. Trump isn't the first president to cheat on his wife, though he may be only the second to lie about it in public. Trump is also, however, the first president to lie about an election, the first to attempt to change the result of an election and the first to refuse to concede power peacefully or to commit to doing so in the future.\n\nTrump is simply wrong about this, but he tells this lie at every rally, and he requires everyone in his circle, as well as everyone in his new administration, to accept it. His reelection will force our nation to accept it, as well.\n\nSecond, Trump has a dubious commitment to the liberal world order that the United States implemented after World War II, which is based on democracy, the rule of law, tolerance, equality and individual liberty. This way of living is far superior to autocratic or theocratic alternatives, but it's also fragile, and it requires constant recommitment.\n\nOf course, millions of Americans share Trump's view of the 2020 election and his wobbly allegiance to the liberal world order. But his reelection will be a genuine break with America's past, a difference in kind, not in degree. It will be a new way of being in the world, one where we can no longer depend on elections or on allies who share our commitment to democracy. It's not an attractive prospect.\n\nSometimes we like to say that we're better than that. But are we? We'll find out in November.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun politics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MGFmZmMwMGYtZmZhNC00:OGQyYTBh/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9608899", "eventUri": "eng-9608899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Every cycle comes with severe bouts of tortured hand-wringing, including the 2022 midterms, when the party had a better outcome than expected.\n\n\"I know that there are people freaking out, there always are. This is not news, in essence,\" said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. \"The way I describe the election now is that we're a higher seed team in the basketball tournament. We should win. But we have to go out and win the game. And it's tied early... but I think we're much more likely to win this thing than they are.\"\n\nBiden is consistently polling behind Trump or neck and neck, with the polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill showing Trump leading by just more than 1 percentage point.\n\nConcern peaked Monday when Politico reported on a collective \"freakout\" among top Democrats as Biden continues to struggle in a number of battleground states and has seen Trump's fundraising hit a new gear in recent months.\n\nWhile some Democrats acknowledge these concerns are valid, they argue time is on their side.\n\n\"Democrats historically are professional worriers,\" said John LaBombard, a Democratic strategist with Rokk Solutions who served as a top aide to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) and former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). \"That said, this year's election includes higher stakes than almost any in recent American history and includes battleground state polling numbers that are certainly not as confidence-inducing as many of us would like.\"\n\n\"Democrats are right to be concerned given that overall picture, but the amount of time between now and November is a lifetime in electoral politics,\" he continued. \"Concern is warranted, but bedwetting is not.\"\n\nJim Messina, former President Obama's 2012 campaign manager, also conveyed optimism about Democrats reaching voters ahead of November.\n\n\"We've known since the beginning that this would be a close election and the campaign is doing the work needed to reach the voters that Biden needs to win,\" he told The Hill.\n\nThe Biden campaign, meanwhile, is working to maintain a sense of calm, which operatives note is a hallmark of the president's operation. His advisers kept the faith during the perilous times of the 2020 Democratic primary and throughout the general election and came out victorious.\n\nThe Biden campaign has for months said it knows the election will be close, but has largely brushed off polling several months out.\n\n\"This election will be close like all presidential elections in this country are. What matters is which candidate is running on a popular and winning agenda, and which candidate is putting in the work to earn the votes of the people who will decide this election,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster said. \"Joe Biden is that candidate, while Trump continues to do nothing to build a winning coalition.\"\n\nTrump outraised Biden in April for the first time this cycle, bringing in $76 million compared to Biden's $51 million. Biden still tops Trump entering June with $192 million total in cash on hand.\n\nBiden has major fundraisers scheduled for June, including in Los Angeles with Obama and Hollywood actors George Clooney and Julia Roberts, and in Virginia with former President Clinton. On June 27, Biden and Trump are set to face off in the first presidential debate of the general election cycle, an event that could boost engagement with voters on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe Trump campaign pounced on the Politico report, using the fact that the Biden campaign held a press conference outside of Trump's New York courtroom on Tuesday as an example of Democrats' worry.\n\nAs attorneys delivered their closing arguments, the Biden campaign brought out actor Robert De Niro and former police officers who protected the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, for the press conference -- a move Republicans painted as a desperate attempt to break through the headlines and gain media attention while the Trump verdict loomed.\n\n\"Why is Joe Biden now making this a campaign event after months of weaponizing the legal system against President Trump? Because Joe Biden's numbers are in the tank,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters, making note of the report. \"Joe Biden is losing nationally. He's losing in every single battleground state. And President Trump's numbers continue to rise.\"\n\nBut Democrats argued the press event was beneficial in several ways. They argued the Biden campaign can't afford to miss out on any opportunities to spotlight Trump's troubles, especially ahead of the June debate.\n\nSome strategists also found it important for the campaign to break through the media wall as Trump's allies were talking to reporters daily outside the courthouse.\n\n\"You have to feed the news-of-the-day beast, and I feel like a lot of times the [Biden campaign] struggles with that,\" said one Democratic operative with experience working on Senate races. \"The news out of the White House is important but it's not always newsy or interesting, so it doesn't make hours and hours of MSNBC or CNN content. De Niro in New York does, so I don't hate doing stuff like that.\"\n\n\"It's not going to win you a swing voter in Pennsylvania, but at least it keeps the news of the day off of 'Biden's old,'\" the operative added.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The former president has long claimed without evidence that prosecutors and other officials are actually targeting his reelection bid as he faces four sets of criminal charges.\n\nAs if to brace voters for a guilty verdict in his New York case, Trump added: \"Mother Teresa could not beat those charges, but we'll see. We'll see how we do.\"\n\nTrump to hit campaign trail full-time\n\nTrump has suggested that even a guilty verdict might conceivably help him because \"the people of the country see this as a rigged deal.\"\n\nThe trial itself started in mid-April and so far does not seem to have hurt Trump much. The former president is leading Biden slightly in many polls nationwide and in battleground states, although most of those leads are within margins of error.\n\nTrump and aides have declined to discuss the specifics of their post-verdict campaign plan except to say it will involve making up for lost time in terms of rallies and fundraisers, of which a bulk of the money coming into his political committee coffers has gone toward lawyer fees.\n\nBiden and his aides have also been circumspect about how they plan to handle the post-verdict campaign, only that it will involve all of the many allegations of misconduct against Trump.\n\nThe Biden team offered a preview of its strategy Tuesday with an event at the downtown courthouse where Trump is on trial.\n\nIt featured Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro and two Capitol Hill police officers who were injured in the pro-Trump insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone. They accused Trump of being a would-be dictator who is willing to encourage violence to get his way.\n\nTrump also faces future trials over Jan. 6-related charges, as well as his questionable handling of classified documents.\n\nBiden officials were careful to say they didn't want to comment on the hush money trial and held the event at the courthouse because so many reporters were stationed there.\n\nMichael Taylor, the Biden team's communications director, said the campaign wants to stress what he called \"the unique threat that Donald Trump poses to our democracy.\"\n\nVoters also wait for the jury\n\nAlso waiting anxiously: Pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators outside the courthouse.\n\n\"I know he's not going to be acquitted - I'm praying for a hung jury,\" said Joe Palau, 57, a pro-Trump construction worker from Brooklyn.\n\nNadine Seiler, 59, who carried a large sign that said \"Convict Trump Already!\" expressed the same concern in a different context.\n\n\"I am very

It was \"weaponization.\" It was \"all done by Biden.\" Trump has \"every single legal scholar\" backing him up. And even a saint likely wouldn't escape a conviction in his hush-money payment trial.\n\n\"Mother Teresa could not beat these charges,\" Trump said to a gaggle of reporters in the hallway. \"These charges are rigged. The whole thing is rigged.\"\n\nTrump's remarks, along with others he made throughout the day in person and in a barrage of posts online, signaled that he has accepted the possibility of a guilty verdict on at least some of the 34 counts brought against him in the Manhattan hush money payment case.\n\nHis team is already preparing to campaign on an acquittal or guilty verdict, according to a person with knowledge of the strategy, with a conviction only further fueling Trump's claims that he is the victim of a Democratic conspiracy to keep him from returning to the White House. The person was granted anonymity to discuss the matter. Repeatedly, as he awaited news of a verdict, Trump labeled events in and out of the courtroom as \"election interference.\"\n\nMoments before the defense, prosecution and reporters scurried back into the courtroom Wednesday afternoon to hear a question from jurors, a Trump fundraising email went out raising a dire possibility for the former president: \"PATRIOT - I COULD BE IN JAIL TOMORROW!\"\n\nBetween Truth Social messages thanking former boxer Mike Tyson for his support and calling actor Robert De Niro a \"mentally challenged servant\" of President Joe Biden (De Niro's press conference the previous day was another example of election interference, Trump said), Trump had posted more than 50 times to his social media on Wednesday about the trial being a sham.\n\n\"KANGAROO COURT!\" Trump posted while on his way to the courthouse in the morning.\n\n\"I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CHARGES ARE IN THIS RIGGED CASE,\" he added after exiting the courtroom midday.\n\n\"According to the Legal Scholars and Experts,\" Trump wrote in the afternoon, referring to the conservative legal and political commentators whose opinions he has repeatedly touted, \"the Jury Instructions, given by a highly Conflicted Judge, will go down as the most biased and unfair in Judicial History. Biden Witch Hunt. Election Interference!!!\"\n\nThe judge on Wednesday delivered a set of lengthy instructions to jurors about how to apply the evidence that was presented to determine Trump's guilt or innocence on 34 counts of falsifying business records -- charges related to individual checks, invoices and ledger entries.\n\nAnd then the jury went behind closed doors for the rest of the day to deliberate the historic decision, emerging only for the judge to discuss a request from them for additional information. Trump split his time between his holding room across the hall and the courtroom itself, flanked on Wednesday by his son Don Jr., in addition to his usual team of attorneys and campaign staff.\n\nIt remains to be seen how long the jury will deliberate the charges against Trump -- a process that could finish as early as Thursday, or last well beyond this week.\n\nBeyond criticizing the case at hand, Trump used his time in front of the cameras Wednesday -- as he does at each campaign rally -- to paint a picture of doom for the nation as a whole if he isn't put back in the White House for another four years.\n\nVenezuela? \"They're releasing all of their criminals into our country.\"\n\nDe Niro? \"A broken down fool.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's staff? \"They're communists, but they're smart.\"\n\nBiden and his campaign team, meanwhile, declined on Wednesday to weigh in on the trial or on Trump's remarks as the former president awaited his legal fate. But less than a hundred miles away, at a campaign stop in Philadelphia to reach Black voters, Biden railed against Trump over other issues -- namely, his past comments and actions on racial matters. Trump and his campaign have touted gains he has made this year with some voters of color.\n\n\"What would've happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don't think he'd be talking about pardons,\" Biden said. \"This is the same guy who wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder. It's the same guy who still calls the 'Central Park Five' guilty, even though they were exonerated.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is pandering and peddling lies and stereotypes for your vote so he can win for himself, not for you,\" Biden added. \"Well Donald Trump, I have a message for you: Not in our house, and not on our watch.\"\n\nTrump from the courthouse continued with his own bashing of Biden.\n\n\"We're going to take back our country from these fascists and these thugs,\" Trump told reporters.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

As a result, people are starting to question what could happen if he loses the general election in November.\n\nWhat Happens if Donald Trump Loses the Election? - It is now clear former President Donald Trump will become the Republican Party's nominee for the 2024 presidential race.\n\nAs a result, people are starting to question what could happen if he loses the general election in November.\n\nIt may not be the end of the country, but it could certainly be the end of the GOP - at least as we know it.\n\nA new CNN poll released months back signaled that three-quarters of Americans (74%) said they believe the former president would refuse to concede it he losses the election. That is a significant increase from those surveyed four years prior to the 2020 election.\n\nTrump previously refused to accept the results of that election, and his supporters later assaulted the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following months of rhetoric claiming the result was stolen or otherwise fraudulent. The former president has again planted the seeds for what could be a new crop of election denial - warning that Democrats are already seeking to rig the general election against him.\n\nIt was on also several months back that Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) warned that Trump could try to \"overturn\" the election again if he loses the 2024 race. The former president would likely have an even harder uphill battle however.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported at the time, Trump will probably find it harder in 2024 to enlist fake electors - people to formally say he carried a state where his opponent was certified the winner.\n\nWhile some are predicting that Trump's loyal followers may resort to violence, history is unlikely to repeat itself. For one, Trump won't have the White House lawn from which to hold a rally. The D.C. National Guard will likely already be out on Election Night and possibly for the weeks that follow.\n\nThe sight of armed troops in the nation's capital will be a sad sight, but it might be necessary to dissuade any hotheads from causing trouble.\n\nA majority of Americans have made it clear they'd like to see neither Trump nor Biden run again, so a Trump defeat could be a hard pill for his faithful to swallow, but it won't be the catalyst for a Second American Civil War.\n\nThe bigger loss won't be a single man failing to return to the election, but it will kill the party of Lincoln and Reagan. Such a loss will result in the extremist fringe - what Biden calls the MAGA Republicans - feeling that their voice isn't heard and that the system is rigged (just like Trump says it is).\n\nThey will be the ones who believe their vote no longer matters. That could leave the GOP in the wilderness for a generation - something pundits wrongly suggested would happen after the Democratic Party's victory in the 2008 election. After that the Republicans came back stronger than ever, retaking control of the House and Senate.\n\nYet the GOP couldn't defeat President Barak Obama in 2012.\n\nThis time, the Republicans may not return because it is unlikely they will move on from Trump. In defeat, he'll remain just vocal enough that he will continue to tarnish the brand.\n\nPossibly, a new right centralist party could emerge. It is also possible that a breakup of the GOP could draw some conservative-leaning Democrats. In a wild fantasy scenario we could see a three-party system of extreme liberals, moderates, and extreme conservatives (MAGA Republicans). That's unlikely to happen.\n\nInstead, the Republicans should be ready for a few years in the wilderness - at least until a new breed of conservative emerges.\n\nPeter Suciu is a Michigan-based writer.

He can't hit a ball 50 yards ... but he knows he'll never play.\"\n\nA few days earlier, while speaking to reporters during a break in his criminal trial this month, Trump invoked Biden's golf game again, after accusing Biden of lying about inflation numbers:\n\n\"[Biden] lies about everything, including his golf game. Because he can't hit a ball,\" Trump said.\n\nIt isn't just Trump who has been taking swings.\n\nEarlier this spring, Biden invited Trump to face off on the golf course, when he appeared on stage at a fundraiser alongside former Presidents Obama and Clinton. During the event, Biden told late night host Stephen Colbert -- who moderated the conversation at the fundraiser -- that he would be \"happy to play\" Trump in a round of golf.\n\n\"I told him once before when he came into the Oval, I said, 'I'll give you three strokes if you carry your own bag,\" Biden said to laughter from the fundraising crowd, recounting an encounter with Trump before the former president was sworn into office in 2017.\n\nBiden, 81, also chose to rib Trump, 77, in March after the former president bragged about winning two awards from his own golf club.\n\n\"Congratulations Donald,\" Biden scoffed in a message on the social platform X. \"Quite the accomplishment.\"\n\nGolf has long been a presidential pastime, where commanders in chief have escaped the stress of the office by hitting the fairway on weekends and holidays.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush famously made a statement to reporters on violence in the Middle East before starting a round.\n\n\"We must stop the terror. I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers. Thank you. Now watch this drive,\" said Bush, who was criticized by the left over the remarks.\n\nObama -- who also often hit the links to escape the White House -- was ridiculed by Republicans for golfing during national crises.\n\nSources tell The Hill that while Biden has spent some time on the golf course over the years and is a longtime member at Fieldstone Golf Club in Delaware, he hasn't devoted much time to the sport since becoming president.\n\n\"I've been told he isn't playing much anymore,\" said one source in Biden world.\n\nAccording to White House pool reports, the last time he picked up a club was with his brother Jimmy Biden last June.\n\nTrump -- who owns 17 golf courses and was mocked as president for playing 307 days during his presidency -- has spent much of his downtime on the course, including an outing late last month when he spent one of the off days of his criminal trial on the course at his club in New Jersey.\n\nBiden's team was quick to highlight Trump's golf outing: \"He was golfing. Not campaigning. Golfing,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement at the time.\n\nAlexandra Kitty, author of the forthcoming book \"The Sport of Presidents: The History of US Presidents and Golf,\" said the sport speaks to each man's style.\n\n\"Golf...It's not just presidential. It's personal,\" Kitty said. \"Your golf game as president says a lot about you, how you think, how you leverage this space.\"\n\nWhile Kitty described Biden as a \"very good golfer,\" she said the president downplayed his tee times to \"differentiate himself against Trump,\" whose golf game is part of his brand.\n\nTrump has also used his apparent golf prowess to undermine Biden's fitness for office. Last week, a post on the former president's official Instagram account showed Trump driving a ball that causes Biden to fall, highlighting a string of Biden stumbles on Air Force One and other moments.\n\nA source in Biden world said, \"Trump has nothing else to offer so he has to resort to literal cheap shots.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

But with some donors signalling unhappiness with Biden's approach to the war on Gaza, this campaign could have real-world implications for the incumbent president's bid for re-election at a time when he is already trailing former President Trump in key swing states.\n\nSo what's behind the Never Biden movement? Are there parallels with the Never Trump campaign? And what's next?\n\nThe #NeverBiden movement first emerged in about 2020 from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, many of them Bernie Sanders supporters who opposed the candidacy of Joe Biden as he emerged as the presumptive nominee.\n\nBut as Biden won the nomination, and Sanders supported him, that campaign largely withered away.\n\nThen came Israel's war on Gaza - and Biden's response to it - which has drawn criticism from supporters of both Israel and Palestine.\n\nThe revival of the #NeverBiden hashtag was initially prompted by Biden's threat to suspend military aid to Israel if were to invade Rafah, Gaza's southernmost town where 1.5 million Palestinians have been sheltering from the war after they were forced out of other parts of the strip by Israel's relentless bombardment and ground assaults.\n\nHowever, last week, the Biden administration approved $1bn in military aid to Israel, and the United Nations reports roughly 800,000 people have fled Rafah since Israel launched a military operation in the area on May 6. This does not include the $26bn in military aid to Israel that was approved by Congress late last month.\n\nAnd that continued support for Israel has, in turn, drawn criticism from some influential donors who have traditionally backed Biden's Democratic Party.\n\nIn a replay of the 2016 Never Trump slogan, Biden is now also receiving the \"never\" treatment, but for a host of different reasons.\n\nMajor Democratic donor and media mogul Haim Saban sent an email to White House aides in early May criticising the Biden administration for halting some weapon shipments to Israel, while stating, \"Let's not forget there are more Jewish voters who care about Israel than Muslim voters who care about Hamas.\"\n\nHowever, on the other political side, George Krupp, a major fundraiser for the Democratic Party told the Financial Times last week, \"I absolutely think that Biden needs to suspend arms shipments both for humanitarian and political reasons.\"\n\nAnd it isn't just donors, and the effects on Biden's re-election campaign coffers.\n\nIn a recent New York Times/Siena Poll, Trump was shown to be leading in five key swing states - Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada - while Biden appeared to be losing support specifically from young and non-white voters.\n\nLast month's decision by the White House to forgive $7.4bn in student debt has not reversed the dampening of support for Biden among young people on university campuses who are protesting against Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nAccording to recent polls support for Israel's military assault dropped from 50 percent in a November Gallup poll to 36 percent in late March.\n\nBeyond the war on Gaza, Biden is also under pressure from voters over his performance on the economy. In a recent personal and household finance poll by Gallup, 41 percent of participants named inflation as their number one financial problem. This is up slightly from 35 percent a year ago and 32 percent in 2022, when the Biden administration signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, a centrepiece of the president's legislative achievements. In 2005, only 10 percent cited inflation as their number one concern.\n\nIn the lead-up to the US presidential election in 2016, which Trump ultimately won narrowly over the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, many conservative Republicans felt Trump was unsuitable for the presidency due to his unpredictable temperament, lack of political experience and what some saw as his departure from established conservative values.\n\n\"I think 'Never Trump' really sort of crystallised for a minority of Republicans, in that while they are Republicans and will always be Republicans, have no doubt about it, they would just never vote for Trump as a person because they thought that his character is just not fit to be president of the United States,\" Louis Perron, political strategist and author of Beat the Incumbent: Proven Strategies and Tactics to Win Elections, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe Never Trump or Against Trump movement would gain significant momentum when National Review, a conservative political magazine, featured its Against Trump campaign in January 2016, with 22 essays from mainstream conservatives explaining their opposition to Trump.\n\nThen, in March 2016, GOP national security leaders posted an open letter, with more than 100 signatories, opposing the prospect of a Trump presidency.\n\nAs the Republican frontrunner, Trump had defended Russian Vladimir Putin's leadership while making disparaging remarks about President Barack Obama's diplomatic efforts with Russia.\n\nTrump said of Putin: \"He is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he's a weak leader? He's making mincemeat out of our president.\"\n\nRepublicans were also outraged by his disparaging comments about the former US Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018. Trump said in 2015 at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa: \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured? I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nMcCain, a former Navy pilot, endured five and a half years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He spent two of those years in solitary confinement at the infamous \"Hanoi Hilton\" prison.\n\nIn a scathing speech in March 2016, Mitt Romney, a staunch GOP conservative and former US senator, said: \"If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.\"\n\nIt's too early to say whether the movement will actually grow and affect Biden's 2024 chances, said Perron.\n\nTrump won despite the Never Trump campaign in 2016, and the Never Biden movement in 2020 didn't stop the former vice president from winning his party nomination and eventually, the presidency.\n\nAnd while there is much evidence of overall disquiet over Biden's policies, from the Gaza war to the economy, it is unclear whether there is any organised effort - as opposed to individual attempts - from within the traditional Democratic establishment to crystallise that sentiment into a campaign against the president.\n\nBroadly, said Perron, a successful political campaign depends on what he called \"the four Ms\":\n\nBut according to Perron, the \"Achilles' heel\" of any political campaign is often not the slogan but those behind it.\n\n\"I think the key here is authenticity. Now, you can have a great slogan, but the messenger is important and has to be authentic when he uses the slogan,\" he said.\n\nOne example is the Black Lives Matter campaign, which spread globally after a police officer killed George Floyd in May 2020, leading to protests against racial injustice and police brutality.\n\n\"Black Lives Matter ... it perfectly summarises the message of the movement, has gone viral on the internet and impacted politicians and the political discourse around the world,\" said Perron.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al

risking antagonizing Trump voters even more.\n\nThe president is reportedly planning to break his silence and give a speech at the White House after the Trump verdict is announced and plans to call him \"convicted felon Donald Trump\" on social media posts if the former president is found guilty.\n\nDemocrats of course would love to throw Trump in jail, too, but don't want him to become a martyr.\n\nBut Biden's behind the scenes planning to react to the verdict just confirms to Trump supporters that the entire trial was politically motivated and a sham.\n\nWhatever Biden decides to say, you can pretty much count on Democrats to mishandle the verdict aftermath and give a boost to Trump.\n\nBiden could also use a guilty verdict to back out of the planned presidential debates, arguing that he shouldn't be on the same stage as a disgraced convicted felon.\n\nThat excuse could give Biden a way out of the debates, which are extremely risky for the 81-year-old Democratic president to participate in.\n\nPrepare to hear that term \"convicted felon\" a lot in the media if the verdict goes Democrats' way.\n\nCNN is already gleefully counting down the minutes that the jury is deliberating and plans a major celebration if Trump is found guilty.\n\nSome Democrats have wisely cautioned about being too celebratory if Trump is convicted, knowing it would politicize the entire trial.\n\nBiden is likely to say something like \"this is a sad day in America\" if Trump is found guilty - marking the first time a former president has ever been convicted of a crime.\n\nAfter all, he doesn't want to make it too obvious how giddy Democrats will be.\n\nPolitico reported that Biden's post-verdict speech will be at the White House to make it seem non-campaign related, which won't fool anyone.\n\nBiden's campaign \"will then argue that the (verdict) shows Trump is ill-suited for office and that it demonstrates the extremes to which the former president would go to win again,\" Politico reported.\n\nTrump had to wait at the New York courthouse for five hours on Wednesday while the jury deliberated.\n\n\"Mother Theresa could not beat these charges,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump - assuming he isn't held in jail - is likely planning to hold a rally in the aftermath of the verdict, in his favorite setting surrounded by adoring supporters.\n\nThat rally could be triumphant if Trump is acquitted, or defiant if he's found guilty.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_battenfeld@bostonherald.com", "name": "Joe Battenfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Election_2024_Biden_Ohio_04858.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9608899", "eventUri": "eng-9608899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The former president has long claimed without evidence that prosecutors and other officials are actually targeting his reelection bid as he faces four sets of criminal charges.\n\nAs if to brace voters for a guilty verdict in his New York case, Trump added: \"Mother Teresa could not beat those charges, but we'll see. We'll see how we do.\"\n\nTrump has suggested that even a guilty verdict might conceivably help him because \"the people of the country see this as a rigged deal.\"\n\nThe trial itself started in mid-April and so far does not seem to have hurt Trump much. The former president is leading Biden slightly in many polls nationwide and in battleground states, although most of those leads are within margins of error.\n\nTrump and aides have declined to discuss the specifics of their post-verdict campaign plan except to say it will involve making up for lost time in terms of rallies and fundraisers, of which a bulk of the money coming into his political committee coffers has gone toward lawyer fees.\n\nOne pivotal event is already on both candidates' schedules: A June 27 debate at a CNN studio in Atlanta.\n\nBiden and his aides have also been circumspect about how they plan to handle the post-verdict campaign, only that it will involve all of the many allegations of misconduct against Trump.\n\nThe Biden team offered a preview of its strategy Tuesday with an event at the downtown courthouse where Trump is on trial.\n\nIt featured Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro and two Capitol Hill police officers who were injured in the pro-Trump insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone. They accused Trump of being a would-be dictator who is willing to encourage violence to get his way.\n\nTrump also faces future trials over Jan. 6-related charges, as well as his questionable handling of classified documents.\n\nBiden officials were careful to say they didn't want to comment on the hush money trial and held the event at the courthouse because so many reporters were stationed there.\n\nMichael Taylor, the Biden team's communications director, said the campaign wants to stress what he called \"the unique threat that Donald Trump poses to our democracy.\"\n\nAlso waiting anxiously: Pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators outside the courthouse.\n\n\"I know he's not going to be acquitted - I'm praying for a hung jury,\" said Joe Palau, 57, a pro-Trump construction worker from Brooklyn.\n\nNadine Seiler, 59, who carried a large sign that said \"Convict Trump Already!\" expressed the same concern in a different context.\n\n\"I am very concerned about a hung jury,\" said

The trial could also result in a hung jury or a not guilty verdict.\n\nWhile generally speaking, running against a convicted felon could be a political gift, the Biden campaign is unlikely to dramatically alter its messaging if the jurors find Trump guilty, a senior campaign official told ABC News.\n\nThe only way to stop Trump is at the ballot box, the official said, that Trump's future is up to voters, not the court.\n\nBiden has largely made just in-passing references to his opponent's trial.\n\nOn the first day of the trial, in April, when a reporter asked Biden if he would watch coverage of the proceedings, the president shook his head, \"no.\"\n\nTwo days later, while discussing Trump's economic record at a Pittsburgh event, Biden noted that his predecessor \"is busy right now\" -- a reference to the ongoing trial.\n\nThat same week, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the president criticized Trump's treatment of women, a possible veiled reference to the trial, where Stormy Daniels, the pornstar Trump paid off, described leaving a sexual interaction with Trump \"shaking.\" Trump has long denied the sexual encounter.\n\nSpeaking about being put on a most-eligible bachelors list after his first wife died, Biden said, \"Unlike the guy running, I didn't take advantage of any [women].\"\n\nAs Biden and Trump challenged the other to debate, Biden said he know Trump was \"free on Wednesdays\" -- a dig that stemmed from Trump's hush money trial not being in session on Wednesdays. Biden's campaign even sold \"Free on Wednesdays\" t-shirts.\n\nAsked on Wednesday how much attention Biden has paid to the Trump trial as jurors deliberate, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said she hadn't spoken to the president about it.\n\n\"The president is focused on the American people -- delivering for the American people,\" Jean-Pierre said in response.\n\nBiden campaign aides have been similarly coy.\n\n\"Through sunny days and stormy nights, Joe Biden's campaign isn't about fighting through his own trials, tribulations and personal grievances,\" James Singer, a campaign spokesman, wrote in a statement during the trial's opening week.\n\nThe campaign broke precedent this week, however, dispatching actor Robert De Niro and two former police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to downtown Manhattan to speak to reporters near the courthouse.\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he can destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\nMichael Tyler, a campaign communications director for the Biden campaign, nevertheless tried to distance the press conference from the trial.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" he said, pointing to the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hung jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Eventing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c7414a9e-53dd-4a52-ab70-1fdd31e9de40/biden-1-gty-er-240529_1717009470591_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9608899", "eventUri": "eng-9608899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He told podcast hosts David Axelrod -- the former senior adviser to former President Obama -- and Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant, that he'd now give Biden similar advice he gave Trump before the 2020 presidential debates.\n\n\"It's the same advice I gave to Trump four years ago that he did not follow,\" Christie said. \"And I said, 'Let Biden talk. If you let him talk, he will hang himself.' And of course, he did the exact opposite and lost the debate.\"\n\nChristie said this time around, he'd tell Biden to do the same.\n\n\"I don't care how angry you get about how absolutely incorrect the stuff he's saying about your record is, about your family, about you personally. Don't engage, because you will lose that fight,\" he said.\n\nChristie argued that if Biden lets Trump talk, voters will ask, \"Can't he shut up?\" Biden doesn't need to say it explicitly, like he did in the 2020 debate; the people watching need to conclude that themselves, he argued.\n\nBiden and Trump are set to debate June 27, and again in September. It'll be the first debates they each have participated in since the 2020 presidential election, because Trump skipped the primary debates.\n\nTensions around the debate are high. Trump, who is currently in the last moments of his criminal hush money trial, could be the first former U.S. president to receive a conviction, and Biden has lost support among his base for his actions surrounding the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAnalysts are predicting the election will be just as close as the 2020 race. The earlier-than-usual debates will be a chance for the candidates to showcase their plans for a second term in office, while fending off attacks from the other candidate.\n\nChristie said he thinks Biden should highlight three or four of his strongest points of his presidency and \"harp on them over and over and over again.\"\n\nHe recommended Biden act like he's in a conversation with the moderator and not debating Trump.\n\n\"Let Trump look like the angry guy standing at the fence, yelling at his neighbor, and you'd be the guy on your lawn mower, with your AirPods in, driving around and every once in a while, just wave as you go by and not even paying attention,\" Christie said.\n\n\"It's two reasons why.

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Trump and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk have discussed a formal advisory role for the billionaire if Trump should win.\n\nThe close back and forth with billionaires is a notable departure from Trump's previous Oval Office runs that often focused more on smaller contributors. The website OpenSecrets tracks donations by size and found that \"large contributions\" made up about 14% of Trump's bankroll in 2016. That same figure this time around is more than 68%.\n\nThe latest example of elite support came last week with the news that Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, after years of keeping his distance from Trump, is now a supporter.\n\nThe financier told Axios he's supporting Trump and will donate to him as a \"vote for change.\"\n\nHe is just the latest wealthy donor to overcome past objections to Trump's conduct and character. Schwarzman responded to the events of Jan. 6, 2021 by saying at the time that the \"insurrection that followed the President's remarks today is appalling.\"\n\nTraditional GOP megadonors return to Trump\n\nThe flip in GOP donor support to Trump comes after many billionaires tried to boost his Republican rivals, especially Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nBut that quickly changed after the primary season ended.\n\nHaley ended her run in March and Trump then outraised Biden in April. That was largely due to a single event featuring an assortment of billionaires at hedge fund manager John Paulson's home in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nThe event raised more than $50 million in a single night.\n\nIn total, Trump raised about $76 million in April, besting Biden's $51 million. But Biden is still ahead when it comes to cash in the bank, with $192 million saved across his operation.\n\nA collection of familiar GOP names announced their support for Trump in recent months, in addition to Schwarzman. They include figures like hotel tycoon Robert Bigelow and activist investor Nelson Peltz.\n\nBoth have donated to Republicans for years. Both distanced themselves from Trump after Jan. 6. Both are now back on board.\n\nRobert Bigelow, the billionaire owner of Budget Suites of America and founder of Bigelow Aerospace, previously backed DeSantis, but he since made plans to give over $20 million to Trump.\n\nHe also reportedly co-chaired the recent fundraiser at Paulson's Florida home.\n\nFor his part, Peltz told the FT earlier this month he would vote for Trump, but donations may or may not be forthcoming. \"I'm not happy about that,\" he told the paper saying he still had misgivings about Trump but they were outweighed by his concerns about Biden's fitness for office.\n\nSome traditional GOP megadonors are still holding out, at least for now.\n\nBillionaire hedge-fund investor Kenneth Griffin told attendees at the Qatar Economic Forum earlier this month that he wants to see who Trump picks as his running mate first.\n\nPeter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal who has long bankrolled GOP campaigns, told the Atlantic late last year he wouldn't be giving any money to Trump or anyone else this presidential campaign.\n\nOutreach to oil executives\n\nTrump has also received support from wealthy energy executives after what appears to be a concerted outreach effort to that industry.\n\nTrump has reportedly made direct appeals for donations in return for looser restrictions on things like oil drilling if he wins.\n\nThat outreach may have pushed the limits of campaign finance laws, according to the Washington Post, with Senate Democrats promising to investigate.\n\nTrump and the industry are \"conferring on how to trade campaign cash for policy changes\" said Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden in a recent statement. \"Such potential abuses must be scrutinized.\"\n\nBut the promises appear to have allowed Trump inroads with oil executives.\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder and chairman of oil and natural gas company Continental Resources, has increased his alliance with Trump in recent months.\n\nFederal Election Commission (FEC) data shows a contribution of $614,000 from Hamm to Trump's joint fundraising committee at the end of March.\n\nHamm had a relationship with Trump that stretched back for years, but he distanced himself after 2020 and gave money to Haley as recently as last year.\n\nA beachhead of support in Silicon Valley\n\nPerhaps the most surprising source of potential billionaire support for Trump comes in traditionally deep blue Silicon Valley.\n\nMultiple recent reports from The New York Timesto Puck have chronicled ongoing efforts from venture capitalist David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital to organize a fundraiser on Mr. Trump's behalf.\n\nWhether the fundraiser -- and a possible appearance on the pair's podcast -- eventually comes together remains to be seen. But the news was especially notable given the long history the two men have of donating to Democrats.\n\nPalihapitiya gave Biden more than $250,000 during the 2020 campaign, according to FEC data.\n\nOther prominent figures like Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz and Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, have lambasted Biden on their social media feeds but, as of yet, have declined to get behind Trump.\n\nAnother closely-watched figure is Musk. The current third richest man in the world has unleashed an onslaught of anti-Biden commentary online this year and says he can't imagine voting for Biden this fall.\n\nThe trend comes after years of Musk's deepening ties with Republicans. A new Wall Street Journal report this week demonstrated the increasingly warm relationship between Trump and Musk after Musk posted in 2022 that Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"\n\nMusk met with Trump in March and, according to the report, now talks with Trump several times a month. The two men have even reportedly discussed giving Musk a formal advisory role on border security, an issue Musk is keenly focused on, as well as on the economy.\n\nWhat remains to be is if Musk stays true to a promise he made in March when he posted \"I am not donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_werschkul@aol.com", "name": "Ben Werschkul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schwarzman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

He can't hit a ball 50 yards ... but he knows he'll never play.\"\n\nA few days earlier, while speaking to reporters during a break in his criminal trial this month, Trump invoked Biden's golf game again, after accusing Biden of lying about inflation numbers:\n\n\"[Biden] lies about everything, including his golf game. Because he can't hit a ball,\" Trump said.\n\nIt isn't just Trump who has been taking swings.\n\nEarlier this spring, Biden invited Trump to face off on the golf course, when he appeared on stage at a fundraiser alongside former Presidents Obama and Clinton. During the event, Biden told late night host Stephen Colbert -- who moderated the conversation at the fundraiser -- that he would be \"happy to play\" Trump in a round of golf.\n\n\"I told him once before when he came into the Oval, I said, 'I'll give you three strokes if you carry your own bag,\" Biden said to laughter from the fundraising crowd, recounting an encounter with Trump before the former president was sworn into office in 2017.\n\nBiden, 81, also chose to rib Trump, 77, in March after the former president bragged about winning two awards from his own golf club.\n\n\"Congratulations Donald,\" Biden scoffed in a message on the social platform X. \"Quite the accomplishment.\"\n\nGolf has long been a presidential pastime, where commanders in chief have escaped the stress of the office by hitting the fairway on weekends and holidays.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush famously made a statement to reporters on violence in the Middle East before starting a round.\n\n\"We must stop the terror. I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers. Thank you. Now watch this drive,\" said Bush, who was criticized by the left over the remarks.\n\nObama -- who also often hit the links to escape the White House -- was ridiculed by Republicans for golfing during national crises.\n\nSources tell The Hill that while Biden has spent some time on the golf course over the years and is a longtime member at Fieldstone Golf Club in Delaware, he hasn't devoted much time to the sport since becoming president.\n\n\"I've been told he isn't playing much anymore,\" said one source in Biden world.\n\nAccording to White House pool reports, the last time he picked up a club was with his brother Jimmy Biden last June.\n\nTrump -- who owns 17 golf courses and was mocked as president for playing 307 days during his presidency -- has spent much of his downtime on the course, including an outing late last month when he spent one of the off days of his criminal trial on the course at his club in New Jersey.\n\nBiden's team was quick to highlight Trump's golf outing: \"He was golfing. Not campaigning. Golfing,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said in a statement at the time.\n\nAlexandra Kitty, author of the forthcoming book \"The Sport of Presidents: The History of US Presidents and Golf,\" said the sport speaks to each man's style.\n\n\"Golf...It's not just presidential.

He faces accusations of falsifying business records to pay Stormy Daniels, a porn star who claimed to have had a sexual encounter with him, to prevent a potential sex scandal in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Michael Cohen, the personal attorney of Trump, paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016.\n\nIn turn, prosecutors accused Trump of violating New York law by reimbursing Cohen through a series of payments disguised as corporate legal expenses during his presidency.\n\nLocal prosecutors also charged Trump with 34 felony counts in violation of New York's corporate record-keeping laws. Meanwhile, Justice Juan Merchan issued a gag order on Trump to prevent him from publicly commenting on potential witnesses, jurors and others involved in the case. But after the trial commenced on April 2024, the judge twice held Trump in criminal contempt, fined him $10,000 for ten violations of the gag order and warned of potential jail time for future breaches.\n\nThese indictments accuse him of criminal activities before, during and after his presidency. But most voters believe these are all politically motivated.\n\nAccording to the McLaughlin and Associates poll, conducted among 1,000 likely voters from May 9 to 15, Trump leads Biden by 47 percent to 43 percent, despite the intense media scrutiny and multiple indictments against Trump and his associates. This reveals a growing sentiment among the electorate over the alleged politicization of legal actions against the former president.

Another 53 percent suspect that Biden intended to prevent Trump from winning the election by jailing him, but 33 percent of respondents disagreed.\n\nTwo months ago, 56 percent of voters thought Biden sought to prevent Trump from winning the presidential election by trying to imprison him. A whopping 86 percent of Republicans agreed with the sentiment, alongside 50 percent of independent voters. However, only 32 percent of Democrats concurred, while 48 percent did not share the same view.\n\nThe March poll also revealed that 58 percent of respondents thought Biden played a role in driving the investigations against Trump, with 40 percent labeling his involvement as \"major.\" Additionally, 58 percent of voters stated they would support Biden stepping back from the legal battles and allowing the elections to proceed without interference, but 34 percent opposed the idea.\n\nFurthermore, the March poll showed that Trump expanded his lead over Biden - 49 percent to 43 percent, up from a 47 percent to 43 percent in February.\n\nRead more news stories about former President Donald Trump at Trump.news.\n\nWatch Rep.

The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Trump and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk have discussed a formal advisory role for the billionaire if Trump should win.\n\nThe close back and forth with billionaires is a notable departure from Trump's previous Oval Office runs that often focused more on smaller contributors. The website OpenSecrets tracks donations by size and found that \"large contributions\" made up about 14% of Trump's bankroll in 2016. That same figure this time around is more than 68%.\n\nThe latest example of elite support came last week with the news that Blackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, after years of keeping his distance from Trump, is now a supporter.\n\nThe financier told Axios he's supporting Trump and will donate to him as a \"vote for change.\"\n\nHe is just the latest wealthy donor to overcome past objections to Trump's conduct and character. Schwarzman responded to the events of Jan. 6, 2021 by saying at the time that the \"insurrection that followed the President's remarks today is appalling.\"\n\nThe flip in GOP donor support to Trump comes after many billionaires tried to boost his Republican rivals, especially Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\nBut that quickly changed after the primary season ended.\n\nHaley ended her run in March and Trump then outraised Biden in April. That was largely due to a single event featuring an assortment of billionaires at hedge fund manager John Paulson's home in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nThe event raised more than $50 million in a single night.\n\nIn total, Trump raised about $76 million in April, besting Biden's $51 million. But Biden is still ahead when it comes to cash in the bank, with $192 million saved across his operation.\n\nA collection of familiar GOP names announced their support for Trump in recent months, in addition to Schwarzman. They include figures like hotel tycoon Robert Bigelow and activist investor Nelson Peltz.\n\nBoth have donated to Republicans for years. Both distanced themselves from Trump after Jan. 6. Both are now back on board.\n\nRobert Bigelow, the billionaire owner of Budget Suites of America and founder of Bigelow Aerospace, previously backed DeSantis, but he since made plans to give over $20 million to Trump.\n\nHe also reportedly co-chaired the recent fundraiser at Paulson's Florida home.\n\nFor his part, Peltz told the FT earlier this month he would vote for Trump, but donations may or may not be forthcoming. \"I'm not happy about that,\" he told the paper saying he still had misgivings about Trump but they were outweighed by his concerns about Biden's fitness for office.\n\nSome traditional GOP megadonors are still holding out, at least for now.\n\nBillionaire hedge-fund investor Kenneth Griffin told attendees at the Qatar Economic Forum earlier this month that he wants to see who Trump picks as his running mate first.\n\nPeter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal who has long bankrolled GOP campaigns, told the Atlantic late last year he wouldn't be giving any money to Trump or anyone else this presidential campaign.\n\nTrump has also received support from wealthy energy executives after what appears to be a concerted outreach effort to that industry.\n\nTrump has reportedly made direct appeals for donations in return for looser restrictions on things like oil drilling if he wins.\n\nThat outreach may have pushed the limits of campaign finance laws, according to the Washington Post, with Senate Democrats promising to investigate.\n\nTrump and the industry are \"conferring on how to trade campaign cash for policy changes\" said Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden in a recent statement. \"Such potential abuses must be scrutinized.\"\n\nBut the promises appear to have allowed Trump inroads with oil executives.\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder and chairman of oil and natural gas company Continental Resources, has increased his alliance with Trump in recent months.\n\nFederal Election Commission (FEC) data shows a contribution of $614,000 from Hamm to Trump's joint fundraising committee at the end of March.\n\nHamm had a relationship with Trump that stretched back for years, but he distanced himself after 2020 and gave money to Haley as recently as last year.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising source of potential billionaire support for Trump comes in traditionally deep blue Silicon Valley.\n\nMultiple recent reports from The New York Times to Puck have chronicled ongoing efforts from venture capitalist David Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital to organize a fundraiser on Mr. Trump's behalf.\n\nWhether the fundraiser -- and a possible appearance on the pair's podcast -- eventually comes together remains to be seen. But the news was especially notable given the long history the two men have of donating to Democrats.\n\nPalihapitiya gave Biden more than $250,000 during the 2020 campaign, according to FEC data.\n\nOther prominent figures like Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz and Shaun Maguire, a partner at Sequoia Capital, have lambasted Biden on their social media feeds but, as of yet, have declined to get behind Trump.\n\nAnother closely-watched figure is Musk. The current third richest man in the world has unleashed an onslaught of anti-Biden commentary online this year and says he can't imagine voting for Biden this fall.\n\nThe trend comes after years of Musk's deepening ties with Republicans. A new Wall Street Journal report this week demonstrated the increasingly warm relationship between Trump and Musk after Musk posted in 2022 that Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"\n\nMusk met with Trump in March and, according to the report, now talks with Trump several times a month. The two men have even reportedly discussed giving Musk a formal advisory role on border security, an issue Musk is keenly focused on, as well as on the economy.\n\nWhat remains to be is if Musk stays true to a promise he made in March when he posted \"I am not donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Appearing at the same press conference as a Biden surrogate, Robert De Niro went as far as to say of Trump, \"The fact is whether he's acquitted, whether it's hung jury, he is guilty -- and we all know it.\"\n\nEven if it were true, the decision to hold a presser outside the courthouse is ... curious. The Biden campaign won't talk about the proceedings, but they will talk near the proceedings?\n\nWe might dismiss it as a lapse in judgment if not for the fact that it's not the only \"lapse\" lately.\n\nIn the video he released two weeks ago challenging his opponent to debate, Biden snarked that he hears Trump is \"free on Wednesdays,\" a reference to the fact that the Manhattan trial hasn't been in session on that day of the week. His campaign then turned around and monetized the jab by selling \"Free on Wednesdays\" T-shirts. With much of the country suspicious about the propriety of trying the case in an election year, the president treating it as an opportunity for political fundraising feels not so norms-y.\n\nThat's not all. Plans are afoot for Biden to speak about the trial once a verdict is reached -- and he intends to do so at the White House itself, not at a campaign event. His aides believe choosing that location will \"show that his statement isn't political,\" but I think it's likely to do the opposite. Using the presidential mansion as a backdrop for Biden's statement will lend it an air of authority that it doesn't necessarily deserve. Why would the president, in his official capacity, weigh in on a jury verdict in New York state court in the first place?\n\nAssuming Trump is convicted, \"Biden's team will then argue that the result shows Trump is ill-suited for office and that it demonstrates the extremes to which the former president would go to win again,\" per Politico. There's even chatter about referring to him as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump\" in online postings going forward.\n\nIt was, is, and hopefully always will be norms-y in the abstract for a political candidate to highlight his opponent's criminal record. We shouldn't want convicts serving in positions of public trust. But this particular criminal trial has always stunk of politics, from the fact that it was held nearly a decade after the events that inspired it to the questionable legal theory on which it's based to the dubious motives of the lead prosecutor.\n\nTrump has spent more than a year screeching that the criminal indictments against him are a form of \"lawfare\" by Democrats keen to hobble his presidential campaign. Their nascent efforts to weaponize the Manhattan trial suggest Team Biden has begun to lean into the accusation.\n\nWhy is this bad? Let us count the ways.\n\nFor starters, it makes the president and his campaign look desperate. And no wonder: They are desperate.\n\nBiden has trailed Trump for months in national and battleground polling. A conviction in this trial is one of two developments before Election Day that might plausibly disrupt that trend. (The other is the presidential debates.) But as we saw yesterday, Biden's campaign is having a devil of a time turning the race into a referendum on his opponent's fitness for office rather than his own. They're running out of time and ideas so they're preparing to promote the heck out of a guilty verdict, should one arrive.\n\n\"Norms\" are a fine thing when you're ahead by 5 points and on a glide path to election, it seems. But when you're 3 points down in the swing states and flirting with a sub-40 job approval, they're negotiable.\n\nIn that sense, the president's electoral trajectory resembles that of his old boss. Like Barack Obama, Biden won his first term by selling an idealistic alternative to a Republican administration whom many voters believed was morally compromised. And like Barack Obama, he's hoping to win a second term by running a cutthroat \"just win, baby\" campaign against his opponent.\n\nNot so norms-y. In hindsight, one might reasonably suspect that the civic idealism of his first campaign was a matter of strategy, not belief.\n\nAnother reason leaning into lawfare is a bad idea is that it seems unlikely to do Biden much good and might plausibly do him real harm.\n\nAccording to a Quinnipiac poll published last week, 70 percent of Americans are already following news of Trump's trial \"very closely\" or \"somewhat closely.\" That number will skyrocket when there's a verdict; it'll be on the front page of every newspaper in the country, the top story on every cable news outlet, and the topic du jour on every social media platform. If he's convicted, the question of his fitness for office will be front and center in the campaign without Team Biden needing to lift a finger.\n\nSo what will be achieved by having the president himself address the matter publicly, except to seemingly confirm Trump's suspicions that the trial was all about giving Democrats a talking point in the campaign?\n\nNothing Biden says is likely to make swing voters more inclined to hold a guilty verdict against Trump. In Quinnipiac's survey, just 6 percent of those who currently prefer the Republican for president said they'd be \"less likely\" to support him if he's convicted. And \"less likely\" doesn't tell us much: If you're 100 percent certain to vote for Trump if he's acquitted and 99 percent certain to do so if he isn't, you're technically \"less likely\" to support him even though your vote is in the bag.\n\nAs with so many of Trump's moral failings, the outcome of the trial simply might not hurt him:\n\nBut it could hurt Biden. The spectacle of the president trying to capitalize politically on a conviction might convince some persuadable voters that Trump was right to view the trial as dirty pool manufactured by Democrats. If that were to happen, it'd be a triple whammy for the left. Voters might be more inclined to dismiss the verdict as illegitimate; they might feel a modicum of sympathy for Trump, God help us; and they might view the gap between him and Biden in terms of their respect for \"norms\" as less meaningful than it is.\n\nThe guy who attempted a coup the last time he was in office and has spent much of his time ever since pondering how to make the next coup plot more successful should be an easy answer to the question, \"Who's more likely to make America into a banana republic?\" The more eagerly Biden embraces political lawfare, the easier it'll be for voters who are motivated to do so to call the issue a wash.\n\nBecause of that, the president's campaign will probably get stuck trying to lean into lawfare a little but somehow not too much, thereby doing just enough to give his critics ammunition without doing enough to win anyone over. Tuesday's event outside the courthouse was a nice example: Having Robert De Niro and some of the January 6 cops speak on Biden's behalf in lieu of prominent politicians was obviously the campaign's attempt to politicize the trial a little without politicizing it too much.\n\nAnd like every other dopey \"half-pregnant\" Biden gesture, it'll alienate more people than it attracts. You can be the norms candidate or you can take off the gloves; you can't do both.\n\nHere's another question. What if leaning into lawfare ends up working for Biden?\n\nImagine he went scorched-earth over the trial, ran hard against \"convicted felon Donald Trump,\" and won a squeaker in the Rust Belt states to secure a second term. How well would Trump voters handle that outcome?\n\n\"As well as they handled the outcome in 2020!\" you might say. \"If Trump loses, they'll call the election unfair no matter what.\"\n\nRight. But it matters how plausible that accusation is, no?\n\nOne of my editors reminded me today how Bernie Sanders supporters would respond to questions about his electability during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Republicans are going to call our nominee a socialist anyway, they'd say, so why not nominate an actual socialist? But the answer to that was simple: \"If Republicans are going to call our nominee a socialist, it's important that we don't prove them right.\"\n\nThe same could be said of Republicans' \"lawfare\" accusations against Democrats. Trump will scream about \"lawfare\" whether or not Joe Biden mentions his trial so why shouldn't Biden mention it? Why indulge the complaints of a political movement that operates remorselessly in bad faith, on the one hand fretting about the civic damage Trump's prosecutions have caused while on the other mobilizing to reelect a coup-plotter who wants \"absolute immunity\" for his conduct in his office?\n\nThe answer is the same as it was for Sanders. Most Americans know Trump is a cretin: No less than 75 percent told Quinnipiac they believe he did something that was at least unethical in the Stormy Daniels matter. But when they see his electoral opponent, the most powerful man in the world, rhetorically spiking the football after a conviction in Manhattan, the benefit of the doubt they've given to law enforcement's good faith in prosecuting said cretin will weaken.\n\nIf Republicans are going to call the criminal charges against Trump a political ploy, it's important that we don't prove them right. Faith in the leadership of this country, especially among the youngest adults, is low enough as it is. A second Biden term will be even more dismal than expected if a huge share of the population -- not just MAGA -- believes that he owes his victory to effective exploitation of Trump's election-year criminal conviction. Especially if that conviction doesn't stick.\n\nOur friend David French recently envisioned a political nightmare in which Trump is convicted in Manhattan, Biden wins narrowly in November, and then the conviction is reversed on appeal afterward. The degree to which that turn of events would shake the faith of Trump voters in the fairness of the system is hard to overstate, but one thing that could plausibly make it more destabilizing than it otherwise might be would be if Biden had placed the fact of that conviction at the heart of his victorious campaign.\n\nThe punchline is that he doesn't need to do so in order to make the case that his opponent is a menace to the rule of the law. He has a coup plot, two impeachments, and a blockbuster civil verdict on a claim of sexual abuse to rely on instead. A conviction in the Manhattan trial adds little to the brief against Trump and presidential commentary on the subject will add even less.\n\nBad civically, bad strategically. So why do it?\n\nThere are two \"good\" arguments for leaning into lawfare. One is that Biden has no choice. Once he agreed to debate Trump, Biden assured that he would eventually have to say something about it. Trump will accuse him onstage next month of having masterminded the four criminal prosecutions he's facing for political advantage. The president will need to respond.\n\nBut some responses are better than others. A good response would be if Biden could truthfully say, \"I didn't order those prosecutions. I haven't made an issue of them. I haven't even commented on them. You're the one who keeps bringing them up!\" A less good response would be, \"Go to JoeBiden.com right now and purchase your very own 'Free on Wednesdays' T-shirt.\"\n\nThe other \"good\" argument is that it's endlessly aggravating to have to entertain the pretense that Donald Trump's authoritarian movement cares about liberal norms and fair play.\n\nWe've considered the roots of that aggravation before. It's not just the hypocrisy of a street fighter sucker-punching everyone in sight and then getting indignant when he's socked in the face. It's the fact that Trump's depravity and the right's boundless tolerance for it created the political dilemma of trying a presidential nominee in the first place. Instead of feeling contrite about that, they're aggressively exploiting the justice system's struggles to cope with the ethical problems presented by the situation to try to weaken faith in that system.\n\nIf Trump wins, important officers in federal law enforcement will be purged and replaced by fascist sycophants. When you frame the stakes that way, you can understand why Democrats are keen to use any political cudgel within reach to keep him out of power, including a conviction in Manhattan.\n\nBut that brings us to the same place we arrived at the last time I wrote about this. If the end of keeping postliberals out of power justifies the means of ditching liberal norms, then we're arguing over which flavor of postliberalism we prefer long-term. If we fear and loathe Trump for setting fires for the justice system, as we should, we should not want Joe Biden adding any fuel by making political hay out of what happens there.\n\nSome anti-Trumpers will read that and conclude that I don't understand the stakes of the election. When democracy is on the line, our side should exploit every advantage it can instead of fighting with one hand behind its back. We can lose by following norms or win by shedding a few of them.\n\nBut that's the New Right's philosophy. The story populists tell themselves to justify war on the liberal order is that civic norms have made meaningful political progress impossible. To neutralize the extraordinary threat posed by their enemies, extraordinary measures need to be taken. \"The norms\" are for normal times. Those who know what time it is recognize that our era isn't normal.\n\nIf that's the attitude we're going to take with Trump, we should make a list of which rules are and aren't fair game to be broken in the interest of defeating populists. If, in the name of winning, Biden is willing to abet the MAGA effort to delegitimize the justice system by doing a little end-zone dancing over the Manhattan trial, what other norms should he and we be prepared to fudge?\n\nWinning this year is crucial, but so is not normalizing populist political narratives. To do so would be to trade a short-term victory for classical liberalism for its long-term defeat.\n\nRead more at The Dispatch", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Here's a guide to each 2024 candidate's stance.\n\nBryan Metzger\n\nMay 30, 2024 at 1:00 PM\n\nIsrael's war in Gaza -- and US support for it -- has become a major issue in the 2024 election.\n\nSome voters are threatening to stay home or cast protest votes over Biden's handling of the issue.\n\nBut Trump would likely be even more supportive of Israel if he gets a second term.\n\nIsrael's ongoing war in Gaza -- and President Joe Biden's continued support for it -- has become a major issue in the 2024 election.\n\nAfter Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in its October 7 attack, Israel launched a counteroffensive aimed at eliminating the group.\n\nThat's led to the deaths of over 35,000 Palestinians, mass displacement and looming famine in the Gaza strip, and an international investigation into whether Israel is committing genocide.\n\nHere's a guide to where President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump stand on Israel -- and why some are threatening to stay home or cast protest votes in November.\n\nWhere Joe Biden stands on Israel\n\nIn general, Biden has remained staunchly supportive of Israel as it has waged its war in Gaza -- but over time, he's gradually pushed the country to change its tack in the war.\n\nHis administration has pushed for a six-week cease-fire, conditioned upon Hamas agreeing to release the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nIn February, he described Israel's conduct in the war as being \"over the top,\" and one month later, he announced the establishment of a temporary port in Gaza while urging Israel to do more to allow the passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nIn March, the US abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire and the release of hostages, allowing it to pass -- though the administration quickly downplayed the significance of that vote.\n\nIn May, his administration halted the shipment of some weapons to Israel amid concerns about the impending invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge. He also threatened to halt further shipments of offensive weapons if a large-scale invasion proceeds, though he has insisted that he will continue to supply the country with defensive weapons.\n\nYet the Biden administration has also cut off US funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the primary source of humanitarian aid in Gaza, over concerns that members of the organization may have been involved in the October 7 attacks.\n\nWhere Donald Trump stands on Israel\n\nTrump, the all-but-certain GOP nominee for president in 2024, has been somewhat murky on the present conflict, criticizing Israel numerous times over the optics of the war.\n\n\"I think Israel made a very big mistake,\" he told Israel Hayom in March. \"These photos and shots. I mean, moving shots of bombs being dropped into buildings in Gaza... it's a very bad picture for the world.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump said in that same interview that Israel should \"go and do what you have to do\" and that \"you have to finish up, you have to get the job done.\"\n\nAs president, Trump was even closer with Israel than Biden is, and he took several steps that benefited the Jewish state, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. His administration also recognized the Golan Heights -- a disputed territory claimed by Syria -- as part of Israel.\n\nTrump has also said numerous times that any Jewish person who votes for Biden or other Democrats should \"have their head examined\" -- a missive that many have found offensive, but that signals he would be more staunchly supportive of the country than Biden.\n\nThe former president has also reportedly pledged to deport pro-Palestinian protestors on college campuses.\n\n\"If you get me reelected, we're going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,\" Trump told a group of Jewish donors in May, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhy some voters might cast protest voters -- or stay at home\n\nGiven that Trump is broadly more supportive of Israel, one might expect voters who are concerned about Israel's war in Gaza to vote for Biden.\n\nThat's especially true given that many of the most vocal opponents of Biden's Israel stance are Arab and Muslim Americans, who have long been a scapegoat for Trump's brand of politics. Trump has also made vague pledges to expand upon the so-called \"Muslim ban\" that he enacted when he was president.\n\nBut many voters aren't doing that.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters who might otherwise support Biden have cast \"uncommitted\" ballots in Democratic presidential primaries this year in protest of his handling of the conflict.\n\nWhile a solid chunk of those voters are likely to vote for Biden in the general election anyway, many say they're still waiting to see Biden change course.\n\nSome are even saying it's too late -- that Biden has supported what they consider to be a genocide, and that there's no way they can vote for him again.\n\nFor these voters -- some of whom may have even had family members killed in Gaza -- they argue that the war outweighs all other considerations.\n\nAbdullah Hammoud, the mayor of the predominantly-Arab city of Dearborn in Michigan, told Business Insider in March that even though he believes Biden has been a \"transformative\" president in terms of his domestic agenda, some of his constituents will never vote for Biden now.\n\n\"A genocide outweighs all of this,\" said Hammoud. \"Aiding, abetting, defending, and supporting a genocide outweighs all that transformative legislation.\"\n\nRather than cast votes for Biden or Trump, these voters may simply stay home, or cast so-called \"protest\" votes for third-party candidates who have no chance of winning, such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein or independent candidate Cornel West.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

Trump possesses only limited immunity for his presidential actions and is thus subject to prosecution by the Biden administration as well as local and state prosecutors.\n\nAs the ancient adage proclaims, be careful what you wish for.\n\nUnless the Supreme Court constructs a bulletproof ruling that shields presidents from endless prosecutions for official acts performed while in office, when elected this fall, Donald J. Trump suddenly will have the power to investigate a wide range of controversial and questionable actions taken by Biden and other previous presidents during their time in office.\n\nThere used to be a \"constitutional norm\" that immunized ex-presidents from prosecution by their successors.\n\nHowever, Biden administration agencies, including the DOJ, FBI, and DHS, have decided to ignore this centuries-old constitutional norm and wage widespread and unfettered lawfare against former president Donald J. Trump and his supporters. In doing so, they have fundamentally changed the rules of political engagement in America.\n\nOn a recent Sunday Futures program hosted by Maria Bartiromo, Eric Trump cautioned that without immunity, former presidents could face endless prosecution. \"Joe Biden won't have one foot outside the White House doors before they begin to go after him ruthlessly,\" predicted Eric Trump.\n\nPresident Trump's DOJ could \"go after Joe Biden for having cocaine in the White House\" as well as \"raiding his opponent's home.\" Eric Trump suggested that the DOJ could even investigate Biden \"for depleting the strategic petroleum reserve two weeks before the primaries in order to boost his standing by lowering gas prices.\"\n\nHe speculated that the DOJ could pursue charges against former president Obama for \"Fast and Furious, where he gives 2,000 weapons to cartel members.\" He speculated that the Trump administration could even \"go after George Bush for lying about weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nStephen Miller, a former senior adviser in the Trump White House, suggested that \"if they say there's no immunity for official acts, the moment Joe Biden leaves office, every single red-city and red-state D.A. in the country can charge him for financial crimes related to illegal student loan bailouts ... war crimes related to deaths of service members overseas ... human-trafficking, human-smuggling and, by the way, more election interference than you can even count.\"\n\nThe Trump DOJ could certainly investigate the possibility that the Biden administration adopted a soft, accommodative approach to our global foe China to protect and enhance Biden family's financial dealings with that country. The same questions could be raised regarding Biden's overly protective stance on Ukraine. Would anyone be shocked if the Trump DOJ next spring raids the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, searching for evidence of Biden's self-serving political policies towards these and other countries?\n\nJim Jordan's Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government recently issued a report claiming that Alvin Bragg has been under political pressure from the Biden administration to pursue charges against President Trump on the bookkeeping \"hush money\" controversy. The report holds Biden culpable for attempting to interfere in the election by keeping his opponent in court.\n\nProminent legal expert Mike Davis, the former chief counsel for nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee, has repeatedly stated that the Biden White House, as well as the offices of Alvin Bragg, Letitia James, Fani Willis, and the Arizona A.G., are all involved in \"clearly coordinated lawfare and election interference\" actions aimed at violating the civil rights of Trump, his aides, and his supporters. By bogging Trump down in court cases, the Biden administration hopes to hamper his ability to campaign effectively.\n\nAccording to Davis, years ago, Barack Obama, while president, put the machinery in place to weaponize the Justice Department and U.S. intelligence agencies against Democrats' political adversaries.\n\nTo get to the bottom or this criminal conspiracy, Davis says, the House should subpoena former prosecutors like Andrew Weissmann as well as Judges Merchan, Engoron, and Chutkan who oversee what many view as biased prosecutions of the former president and 2024 Republican candidate for president.\n\nHe predicts that soon after President Trump is inaugurated on January 20, 2025, his acting attorney general will open a probe into \"a criminal conspiracy to interfere in the election.\" Davis is calling for \"the most severe legal political and financial consequences\" for those involved in this blatant election interference.\n\nDavis sees Mark Pomerantz, an attorney instrumental in pressuring Bragg to prosecute Trump in the N.Y. case, as \"the weak link to incriminate others\" when the Trump DOJ begins its investigations. In his May 2023 congressional testimony, Pomerantz pleaded the Fifth when asked if he broke any laws or violated anyone's constitutional rights or New York State Bar rules during the Trump investigation.\n\nDavis exhorts House Republicans to grant Pomerantz immunity to speak so he can reveal what he knows about the efforts of the Biden regime and Biden himself to interfere in the 2024 election.\n\nCongressman Jim Jordan reiterated on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that \"Alvin Bragg and Jack Smith are in a conspiracy to impact the 2024 election. And Fani Willis is part of this effort as well.\"\n\nAlready, the hunters are becoming the hunted. Due to pressure from the GOP base, Representative Jim Jordan's House Weaponization of Government committee is opening an investigation of whether former Biden administration lawyer Matthew Colangelo's leading role in the Bragg New York trial is further evidence that Biden is using these trials to interfere in the 2024 election.\n\nAlso, N.Y. representative Elise Stefanik is demanding that the DOJ investigate various legal chicanery by Jack Smith. Things are already heating up around Smith -- he stands accused of evidence-tampering in the Mar-a-Lago Presidential Records Act dispute.\n\nHouse speaker Mike Johnson recently stated that \"the Biden administration is weaponizing our justice system to target President Trump. It's election interference. It's borderline criminal conspiracy. American people see right through it. It has to stop.\"\n\nNow Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey announced that he plans to use the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose from the DOJ any information related to \"activity and/or communications between Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Special Prosecutor Jack Smith or Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis related to the investigation or prosecution\" of former president Trump.\n\n\"The investigations and subsequent prosecutions of former President Donald J. Trump appear to have been conducted in coordination with the United States Department of Justice,\" Bailey states. Bailey's Exhibit A is the role former third-highest-ranking DOJ official Matthew Colangelo is now playing in Manhattan D.A. Bragg's criminal case, N.Y. v. Trump.\n\nAmericans understand that the Democrats and their minions in the DOJ, the FBI, the DHS, the IRS, and other alphabet agencies have abused their powers and violated constitutional norms that go back well over 250 years to prosecute Trump, his lawyers and advisers, and even his grassroots followers.\n\nThe American people are demanding accountability and expecting Trump to finally return American governance back to its constitutional roots.\n\nOnly by holding accountable those responsible for violating our constitutional norms can we hope to preserve America's legal traditions.\n\nAfter all, no one is above the law.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Bartiromo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maria Bartiromo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Definitive declarations are expected at the Republican National Convention in July, and at the Democratic Convention in August, at which point the two candidates' names will be formally placed in nomination.\n\nAccording to campaign reporting to the Federal Election Commission, the Biden campaign had around $84 million in the bank at the end of April, while the Trump campaign reported having a $49 million war chest.\n\nPresident Trump won the 2016 presidential election despite being outraised by Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn the 2020 election cycle, spending on the presidential race exceeded $6 billion, according to OpenSecrets.org, a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in American politics.\n\nThe first debate, which will be the earliest televised presidential debate in history, is set to take place on June 27 on CNN in the key battleground state of Georgia.\n\nThe second debate is set for Sept. 10 on ABC News, though a location has yet to be decided.\n\nThere has been some wrangling between the two campaigns over the debates, with President Trump pushing for more dates as he seeks to oust the incumbent, while the Biden campaign has so far agreed to just the two.\n\nAs part of the discussions on holding the debates, the Biden campaign proposed changes that the Trump campaign agreed to. Those changes include an unusually early date for the first debate, limiting the number of debates to just two, and skipping the usual walk-on entry to the debate stage, instead starting with both candidates standing at the podium.\n\nHenry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told The Epoch Times that he believes the debate timing is more likely to benefit President Biden.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

Those concerns were seemingly validated when, weeks before the March State of the Union, special counsel Robert Hur judged the president would come across as a \"well-meaning, elderly man\" in his classified documents case.\n\nBiden delivered an energetic, stump-style speech that helped tamp down a brewing Democratic panic. But the Biden campaign continues to be dogged by months of polling showing him behind in his presidential rematch with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden is taking a gamble with his decision to debate the former president twice before the November election. The first debate, set for June 27, could reinforce the same narrative about his age if he does not meet the low expectations of lucidity set for him.\n\nHowever, Democrats were encouraged by his State of the Union and are counting on him to deliver a similar performance at the first debate.\n\n\"He gave a great State of the Union. He knocked it out of the park. And I think that's the hope with the Democrats, and our belief is that he's going to rise to the occasion in this June debate,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a progressive surrogate for the Biden campaign.\n\nPolitical spectators question whether a debate this early will have a lasting impact on the presidential race. In 2020, Biden and Trump did not appear onstage with one another until September.\n\nBut for the Democrats, it represents what could be the beginning of a reset. Biden is trailing Trump in nearly every battleground state. In Nevada, the polling gap is as large as 13 points.\n\nThose numbers are, at least publicly, regarded with a degree of skepticism. Democrats predict the election will be exceptionally close, just as it was in 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut the Biden campaign has sought to put to rest concerns from party insiders that he could lose in November. At least one Democratic operative in close contact with the White House described the mood as an unmitigated \"freakout,\" according to Politico.\n\nThe State of the Union largely surprised Washington lawmakers. Biden not only avoided major stumbles, but he also landed shots at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a boogeyman for Democrats, and other Republicans jeering him from the audience.\n\nMore importantly, it helped the White House move past the Hur report. Biden would not face prosecution, but interview transcripts released to the public showed him forgetting details including the years he served as vice president and when his son Beau died.\n\nThe State of the Union, given once a year before a joint session of Congress, is normally highly scripted affair in which the president lays out his priorities for the remainder of his term. But Biden used the event as a de facto campaign rally, mentioning his \"predecessor\" more than a dozen times across his 67-minute speech.\n\nBiden runs the risk of fumbling in a more volatile debate setting. However, Biden emerged largely unscathed from his two debates with Trump in 2020, despite Trump's attempts to goad and rattle him.\n\nDemocrats say the State of the Union provides fresh evidence he will do well.\n\n\"Strong. Focused. Knew the issues,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the former House majority leader, said of Biden's speech. \"I think that's what he's going to be at the debate. I think that's why they're having a debate this early.\"\n\nThe June debate has been structured in such a way as to minimize risk to Biden. Trump agreed to the president's request that it be held in a studio, without a live audience, while it is being hosted by CNN, seen as a friendly outlet to Biden.\n\nBiden will have another chance to dispel concerns with his speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, while he agreed to hold a second debate with Trump, this one hosted by ABC, on Sept. 10.\n\n\"He's got three big opportunities. And I think he's gonna move the needle there,\" said Khanna.\n\nBut the June debate, in particular, will be held early enough that if Biden performs poorly, it will have largely receded into the background by Election Day.\n\nDemocrats have bristled at the continued attempts to paint Biden as in cognitive decline, noting Trump is only a few years younger. Voters routinely cite Biden's age as a worry in public polling, but the GOP has also attempted to magnify, and at times distort, his verbal slip-ups.\n\nOn Thursday, the party's research arm posted a clip on X of Biden, who has largely overcome a childhood stutter, appearing to call his vice president \"President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe debate poses the risk that Biden will give Republicans fresh ammunition. Yet Democrats also acknowledge the GOP portrayal gives Biden a chance to exceed expectations in high-profile moments.\n\n\"His speech at the State of the Union was good under any circumstances, but they, frankly, made it even better by the way they had been talking him down before it,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), who debated Mike Pence as Hillary Clinton's vice presidential nominee in 2016.\n\n\"And I have no reason to think that the debate won't be similar,\" Kaine added. \"I wouldn't do too much trash-talking in advance.\"\n\nRepublicans acknowledge there is a danger in setting expectations low for Biden. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), who is on Trump's vice presidential short list, considers Biden's State of the Union performance a \"cautionary tale\" for Republicans.\n\n\"I mean, look, sometimes Biden has good days and sometimes he has bad days. And you don't want to get in a situation where he has a good day and blows away expectations,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's easy for anybody to be on for an hour and a half,\" he added.\n\nTrump has seemingly attempted to reset expectations for the debates, claiming if Biden does well, it is because he is on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\"He's going to be so jacked up for those, you watch,\" Trump alleged earlier this month in remarks before the National Rifle Association. He has previously said without evidence that Biden was \"high as a kite\" during his State of the Union.\n\nSome Hill lawmakers expressed a heavy dose of skepticism that these and other milestones in the presidential race will do much to change the dynamic.\n\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-MI), a retiring congressman from the swing state of Michigan, predicted the independent voters who will decide the election are not going to be the ones plugged into the debate performances.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who debated Trump in the 2016 presidential primary, said voters' perception of Biden are already set and won't be changed by a single debate performance.\n\nIndeed, a snap poll taken after the second presidential debate in 2020 found that viewers did not walk away with a materially different assessment of Trump or Biden. The president did not see a polling bump in the days after his State of the Union, either.\n\n\"It could reinforce what people have already seen,\" Rubio said of Biden. \"But I don't think he's gonna go in there and light the world on fire and change everybody's mind about what they have seen from him over the last three and a half years.\"\n\n\"These aren't two people running for sheriff,\" he added. \"They're pretty well known.\"\n\nA debate does not only pose risks for Biden. In 2020, Trump was perceived as having been too combative in their first debate, while Democrats are banking on him treating the debate stage like a campaign rally.\n\n\"He goes into weird tangents that are kind of really hard to understand what's going on,\" said Kaine. \"Will he do that in a debate? We'll see.\"\n\nNonetheless, the debates are widely regarded as a bigger liability for Biden. Republicans generally believe the president would not have accepted them if he were not behind in the polls. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has attempted to cast Biden as afraid to appear onstage by demanding additional debates beyond the two.\n\nKildee suggested the debate is a chance for Biden to overcome what he sees as a gap between public perception and his own experience with the president.\n\n\"I mean, I know him. I've talk to him for hours on end,\" Kildee said. \"If he could just present that Joe Biden, I don't have any problem at all.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nKhanna, the Biden surrogate, tacitly acknowledged the president is behind by giving a positive spin to his underdog status. He pointed to Biden's performance in vice presidential debates as Barack Obama's running mate, plus his two debates against Trump.\n\n\"Somehow, he always is underestimated. And I think in many ways, he's like Harry Truman,\" Khanna said of Biden, referring to the 33rd president's upset victory in 1948. \"As president, he is underestimated -- he's going to be coming from behind in the polls, but he'll win.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

And among those watching most closely are world leaders near and far.\n\nGlobal surveys conducted in recent months have concluded that President Joe Biden enjoys far more international support than former President Donald Trump. Moreover, across a broad swath of high and middle income countries, the percentage of foreigners who said they trust Biden \"to do the right thing regarding world affairs\" was significantly higher than those who said they trusted Trump.\n\nOf course, world leaders have generally stayed mum on the issue of which man they prefer - although I would wager that most favor the status quo over a return to the raucous years of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I am not going out on much of limb by saying that world leaders felt quite uncomfortable with Trump and his reckless foreign policies during his term in office,\" veteran political strategist Hank Sheinkopf told me.\n\n\"Europeans trust Biden and worry whether a possible return of Trump will signal an end to NATO and their ability to count on America to protect them with its nuclear shield and vast military capabilities,\" added Sheinkopf, who has advised on political campaigns in 14 different countries during his storied career.\n\n\"Leaders across Asia are generally worried about what the destabilizing nature of Trump's aggressive stance against China might have in the region. And for leaders in Latin America and Africa, it's no secret that these are areas of the world that Trump doesn't care much about at all,\" he said.\n\n\"To sum it up, unless we're talking about some far-right populists like Javier Milei in Argentina, embattled pols like Israel's Netanyahu, or autocrats like Victor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary and Russia's Vladimir Putin, it's a pretty safe bet to say world leaders are rooting -- praying even -- for a Biden part deux,\" said Sheinkopf.\n\nWith so much at stake -- whether it's climate change or global security -- world leaders can be forgiven for breaking with tradition and making their case to the American people for why the US would be well-advised to give Biden another term.\n\nAlthough many on the American right would likely lambast such pronouncements by foreign leaders and accuse them of \"meddling\" in our elections, those in the middle - in particular, the 6% of voters in six swing states who will actually decide who wins in November - might actually care to know how the rest of the world feels about the choices before them.\n\nSome world leaders have already signaled their aversion to another Trump presidency. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who endured a tough couple of years during the first Trump administration, has been quite vocal about the threat another Trump presidency could have on global climate action.\n\nAnd there is one global leader who isn't at all afraid about speaking his mind: Brazil's Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who came right out and said the quiet part out loud. \"I hope Biden wins the election,\" affirmed the Worker's Party leader in an interview with a Brazilian TV station in February. \"Although I am not a US voter, I think it's obvious that Biden is a greater guarantee for the survival of democracy in the world and the United States.\"\n\nFor American voters who are on the fence about an octogenarian Biden who seems to have lost some pep in his step, or those who have some serious misgivings about America's role in supporting Israel's war in Gaza, perhaps hearing more about the cataclysmic impact a second Trump term would have on hundreds of millions -- even billions -- of people across the globe might mean something.\n\nBut for these foreign leaders, coming out against Trump is a move that is chock full of risks.\n\n\"Trump, if elected, will take Lula's action personally,\" observed Sheinkopf. It's entirely feasible that Trump will then work to end the influence of the BRICS (a bloc of major emerging economies, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) just to get even,\" Sheinkopf added.\n\nAccording to one recent Axios report, the advice to foreign leaders from one plugged-in Washington lobbyist was to play it safe: \"Don't put yourself in a position where you can be perceived as being pro-Biden. Because that can be interpreted the wrong way by Team Trump. Likewise, Team Biden could interpret any pro-Trump overtures the same way.\"\n\nBut when the defense of democracy, climate change and perhaps even global security are at risk, playing it safe is no longer a valid option for these world leaders.\n\nWhile it's been a hallmark of our democratic system that Americans of all political stripes should be wary of foreign interests of any kind who seek to influence our elections, this is no ordinary time.\n\nThe next US president will make decisions that will not only affect some 340 million Americans -- but nearly every person on planet earth. Among the critical global issues weighing in the balance this November: how we as a planet address climate action, whether the US decides to preserve decades-old global security alliances, and most importantly, whether the US will continue to be a beacon of light in the promotion and defense of democracy.\n\nThe stakes in this election are too high for global leaders to stay mum. Hopefully more of them speak up about the dangers of a second go-around with Trump.\n\nAnd hopefully some Americans -- particularly in those critical swing states -- will be listening.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Don't give me your weak sauce about wanting different candidates. You broke it. You buy it.\n\nWith nothing but Jake Tapper and Dana Bash standing between Trump and Biden on June 27, this could get wild. We need rules, people.\n\nBiden and Trump should be able to prove their physical stamina\n\nI'm not quite sure what the guidelines were for such a street fight when Biden and Trump were younger men. The gangs of the era were the Sharks and Jets. Men solved their grievances with chains, bats, and fisticuffs. These days it's taunting multi-cut videos and Truth Social posts. We must develop a debate format befitting the majesty of our modern politics.\n\nI've seen Biden sometimes navigate steps successfully. Trump has carried at least four pizza boxes at one time. Nevertheless, we must use the rhetorical rumble as an opportunity to establish physical fitness for one of the most demanding jobs on the planet.\n\nBiden has agreed to this in the past. \"Let's do push-ups together, man, let's run, let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take an IQ test, all right?\" an upset Biden told Iowa voter Merle Gorman on a campaign stop in 2019.\n\nAmerica's justice system is not broken, but politicians claim it is when it's convenient\n\nTrump, for his part, is proud of his physical supremacy over lesser specimens. \"[Ronny Jackson] was the White House doctor. He was a great doctor. He was an admiral, a doctor, and now he's a congressman,\" Trump said at CPAC in 2022. \"I said, 'which is the best if you had your choice?' and he sort of indicated doctor because he loved looking at my body. It was so strong and powerful.\"\n\nTo be fair, I looked up a few exercise challenges for octogenarians. A robust round of chair sits is just what the doctor ordered. We need to know how many times each candidate can sit in a chair and stand up without resting for more than 10 seconds. You can't have a White House situation room without \"sit,\" but I was hoping for something a little more competitive.\n\nApparently, AI believes a roller skate obstacle course is a bridge too far for folks with hip vulnerabilities. I would settle for an office chair race around the empty studio. I can just hear Biden taunting Trump as a \"lying dog-faced pony soldier\" before Tapper drops the green flag.\n\nTrump and Biden have knack for putting their feet in their mouths\n\nI'm a huge fan of \"The Office,\" so I understand the value of reaching different ethnicities within America's melting pot culture. In honor of the \"Diversity Day\" episode, each presidential candidate should perform their best accent. If the past is prologue, I can predict the accents Biden and Trump will choose with a high level of certainty.\n\n\"You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts [in Delaware] unless you have a slight Indian accent. And I'm not joking,\" Biden claimed in 2006. As such, we'll put him down for \"slight Indian.\"\n\nTrump is a little more difficult, but I suspect he'll go with the recently famous Irish brogue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Educating his audience at Pennsylvania rally in April on the \"beautiful\" Battle of Gettysburg, Trump noted one of Lee's lesser-known quotes. \"'Never fight uphill, me boys, never fight uphill.' They were fighting uphill, he said, 'Wow, that was a big mistake,' he lost his great general,\" Trump recalled. \"'Never fight uphill, me boys,' but it was too late,\" Trump added.\n\nWith physical fitness and diversity outreach out of the way, we should test determine mental capacity.\n\nFor both of the candidates, memory isn't that big of a deal. Who among us hasn't forgotten the name of the leader of a country we're supplying with nuclear submarines? Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a complete mouthful. Biden just went with \"that fella Down Under\" in 2021. Not to be outdone, Trump likes Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador so much that he allegedly shortened his name to \"Juan Trump.\" If a candidate has nicknames and corresponding accents, they'll do just fine at foreign affairs.\n\nTo really test mental prowess, we should turn to science. Just put magnets and a glass of water on a table in front of the candidates. The first one to successfully deactivate the magnet wins.\n\nBiden will struggle, and I'm showing a little Republican bias in the test. Trump knows EXACTLY what to do. \"Now, all I know about magnets is this,\" Trump revealed earlier this year. \"Give me a glass of water, let me drop it on the magnets, that's the end of the magnets.\" As we all know, a quick dip in jojoba oil powers them right back up.\n\nGrab your popcorn, this is going to quite a show\n\nIf the moderators are brave, they could ask either candidate to commune with the dead from the stage. They both have experience.\n\nWho can forget Biden looking for departed Indiana Congresswoman Jackie Walorski? \"Jackie, are you here? Where's Jackie?\" he asked in 2022. \"She must not be here.\" Since his transition into politics over the last decade, Trump apparently spoke to Old Blue Eyes. Trump recently claimed that Frank Sinatra, who died in 1998, told the former-President to \"never eat before you perform,\" to which Trump responded, \"I'm not performing, I'm a politician.\"\n\nWith those formalities out of the way, Tapper and Bash can move towards hard-hitting questions befitting their respective names.\n\nVoters want to know from Biden if he really believes in his heart that \"poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\" Trump needs to be frank about the current prosecution against him. Why did he pay hush money to his mistresses through his businesses and not out of his personal bank account like every other law-abiding politician?\n\nI'm tempted to leave the rest of the questions to the Communist National News (CNN), but who can we trust when Fox News is as \"fair and balanced\" as a Hamas press release. We'll probably have to do our own research at the end of the day.\n\nTruthfully, nothing (other than an Ivy League student supporting a terrorist organization by demanding snacks and bottled water) is more American than this duel to determine the next leader of our proud nation. Grab your popcorn, folks. Slather it in butter and salt. Get ready not to move for several hours.

But they know they have to work to bolster enthusiasm for Biden among young, black, and Hispanic voters,\" Axios notes.\n\nBut some critics wonder why only blacks would be catered to so extensively.\n\n\"Do you ever read Biden launching new strategy to win white voters? or Asian voters or Latino voters...,\" one critic rhetorically asked.\n\nOther critics, especially black ones, slammed the Biden administration for only now pandering to them for the upcoming election and for never ever delivering on any of their promises.\n\nThis new effort by the Biden administration is starting kind of late. It was months ago in February that MSNBC held a panel with several black male voters from Charleston, South Carolina -- a number of whom wound up expressing support for Trump, not Biden.\n\nThe discussion occurred at a barbershop where MSNBC correspondent Trymaine Lee asked barbers and customers alike what Trump's \"appeal\" is among them.\n\n\"Money,\" several responded.\n\n\"I mean, Donald Trump has a reputation of being the money man, so,\" one man, Anthony Freeman, said.\n\nThomas Murray, another black man, added that he was particularly impressed with Trump's business acumen.\n\n\"I just think that Donald Trump, in spite of all the craziness he may have in his head, reading some of the things that he talks about with business, I can kind of agree with as far as business-wise, because I'm trying to grow my business,\" he said.\n\n\"As far as Biden, I haven't seen Biden really care about business like that. And my concern is having my business so that I can build generational wealth, so my kids can see and have something to take upon when I'm not here,\" he added.\n\nHe made a terrific point about Biden's apathy -- if not distaste -- for small and large businesses alike. There's a reason why the president's approval rating among small business owners hit a new low late last year.\n\nAnother black man, Juston Brown, noted during MSNBC's barbershop discussion that many people want to be just like Trump.\n\n\"A lot of people admire the persona and they want to be him,\" he said. \"They want to enjoy the perks that he has. He seems to always be able to circumvent the rules.\"\n\nAnd finally, voter Kinard Givens said that to his friends, the choice between Trump and Biden was a clear one.\n\n\"A lot of my friends we've only voted once, and Trump is kind of all we know -- Trump and Biden. And they're like, 'Well, we were broke with Biden. We weren't with Trump,'\" he said.\n\n\"And that's kind of the only thing that I'm hearing over and over again is that, 'with Trump, we had money.' Well, okay, I hear you guys, but personally, morally, I couldn't see myself,\" he added.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Here's a guide to each 2024 candidate's stance.", "body": "But Trump would likely be even more supportive of Israel if he gets a second term.\n\nIsrael's ongoing war in Gaza -- and President Joe Biden's continued support for it -- has become a major issue in the 2024 election.\n\nAfter Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in its October 7 attack, Israel launched a counteroffensive aimed at eliminating the group.\n\nThat's led to the deaths of over 35,000 Palestinians, mass displacement and looming famine in the Gaza strip, and an international investigation into whether Israel is committing genocide.\n\nHere's a guide to where President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump stand on Israel -- and why some are threatening to stay home or cast protest votes in November.\n\nIn general, Biden has remained staunchly supportive of Israel as it has waged its war in Gaza -- but over time, he's gradually pushed the country to change its tack in the war.\n\nHis administration has pushed for a six-week cease-fire, conditioned upon Hamas agreeing to release the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nIn February, he described Israel's conduct in the war as being \"over the top,\" and one month later, he announced the establishment of a temporary port in Gaza while urging Israel to do more to allow the passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nIn March, the US abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire and the release of hostages, allowing it to pass -- though the administration quickly downplayed the significance of that vote.\n\nIn May, his administration halted the shipment of some weapons to Israel amid concerns about the impending invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge. He also threatened to halt further shipments of offensive weapons if a large-scale invasion proceeds, though he has insisted that he will continue to supply the country with defensive weapons.\n\nYet the Biden administration has also cut off US funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the primary source of humanitarian aid in Gaza, over concerns that members of the organization may have been involved in the October 7 attacks.\n\nTrump, the all-but-certain GOP nominee for president in 2024, has been somewhat murky on the present conflict, criticizing Israel numerous times over the optics of the war.\n\n\"I think Israel made a very big mistake,\" he told Israel Hayom in March. \"These photos and shots. I mean, moving shots of bombs being dropped into buildings in Gaza... it's a very bad picture for the world.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump said in that same interview that Israel should \"go and do what you have to do\" and that \"you have to finish up, you have to get the job done.\"\n\nAs president, Trump was even closer with Israel than Biden is, and he took several steps that benefited the Jewish state, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. His administration also recognized the Golan Heights -- a disputed territory claimed by Syria -- as part of Israel.\n\nTrump has also said numerous times that any Jewish person who votes for Biden or other Democrats should \"have their head examined\" -- a missive that many have found offensive, but that signals he would be more staunchly supportive of the country than Biden.\n\nThe former president has also reportedly pledged to deport pro-Palestinian protestors on college campuses.\n\n\"If you get me reelected, we're going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,\" Trump told a group of Jewish donors in May, according to the Washington Post.\n\nGiven that Trump is broadly more supportive of Israel, one might expect voters who are concerned about Israel's war in Gaza to vote for Biden.\n\nThat's especially true given that many of the most vocal opponents of Biden's Israel stance are Arab and Muslim Americans, who have long been a scapegoat for Trump's brand of politics. Trump has also made vague pledges to expand upon the so-called \"Muslim ban\" that he enacted when he was president.\n\nBut many voters aren't doing that.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters who might otherwise support Biden have cast \"uncommitted\" ballots in Democratic presidential primaries this year in protest of his handling of the conflict.\n\nWhile a solid chunk of those voters are likely to vote for Biden in the general election anyway, many say they're still waiting to see Biden change course.\n\nSome are even saying it's too late -- that Biden has supported what they consider to be a genocide, and that there's no way they can vote for him again.\n\nFor these voters -- some of whom may have even had family members killed in Gaza -- they argue that the war outweighs all other considerations.\n\nAbdullah Hammoud, the mayor of the predominantly-Arab city of Dearborn in Michigan, told Business Insider in March that even though he believes Biden has been a \"transformative\" president in terms of his domestic agenda, some of his constituents will never vote for Biden now.\n\n\"A genocide outweighs all of this,\" said Hammoud. \"Aiding, abetting, defending, and supporting a genocide outweighs all that transformative legislation.\"\n\nRather than cast votes for Biden or Trump, these voters may simply stay home, or cast so-called \"protest\" votes for third-party candidates who have no chance of winning, such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein or independent candidate Cornel West.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Direct to your inbox. Sign up for the Morning Report newsletter\n\nTwelve New York jurors, including two lawyers, spent much of Wednesday afternoon deliberating whether former President Trump is guilty of 34 felony charges that boil down to an alleged fraudulent coverup of a pay-for-silence scheme to keep 2016 voters in the dark about an account of sex with a porn star.\n\nTrump is not known for patience when he's in circumstances beyond his control. He denies the charges, including allegedly masterminding a hush money scheme that included doctored business records, and maintains that he's a victim of a Democratic prosecutor and a \"corrupt\" judge. In the first criminal trial of a U.S. current or former president, he's required to remain in the courthouse while the jury is at work.\n\n\"Mother Teresa could not beat these charges. The charges are rigged. The whole thing is rigged,\" Trump protested outside the courtroom Wednesday.\n\nJurors resume their deliberations today. Their verdict on each count -- guilty or not guilty -- must be unanimous.\n\nThe defense's legal strategy during the trial was to deny a felony occurred and to try to weaken the credibility of key witnesses, including Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who testified against the former president after his own conviction and prison time following his guilty plea for lying to investigators and tax violations.\n\nJurors asked the judge Wednesday to let them review some testimony from Cohen about an August 2015 meeting he had at Trump Tower with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker and with Trump (The Hill). Pecker testified for the prosecution that Trump was a friend he sought to help during the 2016 presidential campaign by paying for unflattering accounts about the candidate to prevent them from being published. In tabloid circles, the phrase was \"catch and kill.\"\n\nPecker testified that during a meeting in the summer of 2015 with Trump and Cohen, he outlined how he would help the presidential candidate, a deal that included notifying the Trump campaign about women seeking to sell stories about relationships with Trump. Pecker later testified he balked at having the Enquirer pay a \"catch and kill\" fee to porn star Stormy Daniels, which Cohen testified he paid as a middleman before securing reimbursement from Trump early in 2017.\n\nDaniels testified that she and her lawyer received $130,000 from Cohen to prevent publication of her account of an alleged 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which she detailed to the jury. But she said she had no knowledge whether the former president was involved in the transaction.\n\nTrump's legal team did not refute that a married Trump met Daniels in a hotel room or that there was payment a decade later for her silence. Instead, they suggested the payments made on the former president's behalf were an effort to protect his reputation and family -- not his campaign.\n\nWORRY WATCH: Democratic leaders are warning against a full-blown meltdown over polls showing President Biden lagging behind Trump, and the party's danger of losing its Senate majority. Anxiety among Democrats is at a high-water mark, but it's also something the leaders are used to, write The Hill's Al Weaver and Alex Gangitano. Every cycle comes with severe bouts of tortured handwringing, and Biden is consistently polling behind Trump or neck and neck, with the polling averages from DDHQ/The Hill showing Trump leading by just more than 1 percentage point.\n\n\"I know that there are people freaking out, there always are. This is not news, in essence,\" said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg. \"The way I describe the election now is that we're a higher seed team in the basketball tournament. We should win. But we have to go out and win the game. And it's tied early... but I think we're much more likely to win this thing than they are.\"\n\nPolitico: Biden is investing heavily in Pennsylvania -- with little to show for it.\n\nAcross the aisle, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) views incumbency as Senate Democrats' biggest advantage in the battle for the upper chamber, acknowledging that the quality of Senate Democratic candidates is a major factor. While Trump is leading Biden in several battleground states, The Hill's Alexander Bolton reports Senate GOP candidates are trailing incumbents.\n\nMcConnell's logic also underscores Democrats' concerns that Biden's age -- not his record or position on the issues -- is their biggest political headwind.\n\n\"I think incumbency, as we learned in '22, is an advantage. Not a single incumbent lost in '22. Sen. Daines and I have never said we thought this was going to be easy,\" McConnell told reporters during a recent press conference with National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Steve Daines (Mont.). \"We've got to beat an incumbent in Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and anywhere else we can, but we never said it was going to be a piece of cake.\"\n\nThe New York Times: \"The Tilt,\" by Nate Cohn: Perhaps lost in the polling: The presidential race is still close. If Biden won in battlegrounds Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, \"he'd probably be re-elected as president. They would combine to give him exactly 270 electoral college votes provided he held everywhere he won by six percentage points or more in 2020. That means he could lose all of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio and so on, and still win.\"\n\nCohn's math assumes a victory in Virginia, but the race is tight. It is telling if Biden is worried about losing the state in November.\n\nSUPREME COURT JUSTICE Samuel Alito wrote letters to House and Senate Democrats saying he won't step aside from two pending high court cases related to Trump and the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol following news reports about contentious flags flown at his house and vacation home. Alito said he was not involved in flying an upside-down American flag and a \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag, pointing to his wife's decision making. Democratic lawmakers have criticized Alito as biased amid pending cases before the court and urged the nine justices to adopt stringent ethics rules covering conflicts of interest. Trump, marking time in a Manhattan courthouse as a jury weighs his guilt or innocence, immediately praised Alito Wednesday on social media for \"INTELLIGENCE, COURAGE, AND 'GUTS'\" in refusing to recuse himself.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Democrats asked Chief Justice John Roberts to detail how the Supreme Court plans to enforce its code of conduct, arguing Alito violated its policies (The Hill).\n\n\"Adopting a code of ethics and failing to enforce [it] only serves to reinforce the perception that Supreme Court justices operate without consequences for clearly unethical behavior,\" ranking member Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) and the committee's Democrats wrote in the letter. \"Do you plan to request Justice Alito recuse himself from any cases related to Donald Trump? If not, why not?\"\n\nTHE HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE on Wednesday launched an investigation of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) after the congressman and his wife were indicted on allegations that they accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and laundered the money. Three people associated with the lawmaker and his wife have pleaded guilty in the investigation. Cuellar, who is facing a challenging reelection race this fall, said he is innocent (The Hill).\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is emphasizing the need for federal legislation that would add protections around the spread of nonconsensual artificial intelligence (AI) deepfake pornography. Ocasio-Cortez said the issue is increasingly putting \"everyday people\" at risk of \"being targeted by this kind of reputational, sexual violence that is at its core exploitative\" (The Hill).\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE HAS SNARLED Congress's plans to reprimand the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the Israel-Hamas War, shooting down the sanctions concept that bipartisan House negotiators had hoped to move to Biden's desk early next month. The court came under fire after its top prosecutor announced his intent to seek arrest warrants for Israeli leaders -- including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- as well as Hamas leaders for war crimes. But White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday that legislation against the ICC \"is not something the administration is going to support\" (The Hill).\n\nNetanyahu said Wednesday he's \"surprised and disappointed\" that the Biden administration won't support the sanctions, Politico reports. In an interview with Sirius XM's \"The Morgan Ortagus Show,\" set to air Sunday, Netanyahu defended himself against the court's allegations that he and Israeli authorities purposefully withheld humanitarian aid from entering Gaza since the war began.\n\nSEVEN MORE MONTHS: Israel's national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said Wednesday that he expects Israel's war in Gaza to continue through at least the end of the year, appearing to dismiss the idea that the war could come to an end after the attacks on Rafah. Israeli officials have told the public to expect a protracted campaign that would progress in phases toward lower intensity fighting. But Hanegbi's assessment appeared to be at odds with earlier projections that the country was \"on the brink of victory\" in its war against Hamas (The New York Times).\n\nU.S. NOD TO UKRAINE TO STRIKE INSIDE RUSSIA? The White House could be open to strikes by the Ukrainian military inside Russia, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested Wednesday while traveling in Moldova (The New York Times). The U.S. would \"adapt and adjust\" its stance based on changing conditions on the battlefield, he told a reporter. Washington has supplied the Ukrainians with military aid but previously warned of a possible widening conflict and NATO vulnerabilities if Ukraine attacked inside Russia's borders and Moscow then escalated. Biden is contemplating a nuclear armed adversary while weighing the future for an ally struggling in war (The New York Times).", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Here's a guide to each 2024 candidate's stance.", "body": "Israel's war in Gaza -- and US support for it -- has become a major issue in the 2024 election. Some voters are threatening to stay home or cast protest votes over Biden's handling of the issue. But Trump would likely be even more supportive of Israel if he gets a second term.\n\nIsrael's ongoing war in Gaza -- and President Joe Biden's continued support for it -- has become a major issue in the 2024 election.\n\nAfter Hamas killed more than 1,200 people in its October 7 attack, Israel launched a counteroffensive aimed at eliminating the group.\n\nThat's led to the deaths of over 35,000 Palestinians, mass displacement and looming famine in the Gaza strip, and an international investigation into whether Israel is committing genocide.\n\nHere's a guide to where President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump stand on Israel -- and why some are threatening to stay home or cast protest votes in November.\n\nWhere Joe Biden stands on Israel\n\nIn general, Biden has remained staunchly supportive of Israel as it has waged its war in Gaza -- but over time, he's gradually pushed the country to change its tack in the war.\n\nHis administration has pushed for a six-week cease-fire, conditioned upon Hamas agreeing to release the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nIn February, he described Israel's conduct in the war as being \"over the top,\" and one month later, he announced the establishment of a temporary port in Gaza while urging Israel to do more to allow the passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nIn March, the US abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire and the release of hostages, allowing it to pass -- though the administration quickly downplayed the significance of that vote.\n\nBiden described Israel's conduct of the war as \"over the top\" at a February press conference. Foto: Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nIn May, his administration halted the shipment of some weapons to Israel amid concerns about the impending invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge. He also threatened to halt further shipments of offensive weapons if a large-scale invasion proceeds, though he has insisted that he will continue to supply the country with defensive weapons.\n\nYet the Biden administration has also cut off US funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the primary source of humanitarian aid in Gaza, over concerns that members of the organization may have been involved in the October 7 attacks.\n\nWhere Donald Trump stands on Israel\n\nTrump, the all-but-certain GOP nominee for president in 2024, has been somewhat murky on the present conflict, criticizing Israel numerous times over the optics of the war.\n\n\"I think Israel made a very big mistake,\" he told Israel Hayom in March. \"These photos and shots. I mean, moving shots of bombs being dropped into buildings in Gaza... it's a very bad picture for the world.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump said in that same interview that Israel should \"go and do what you have to do\" and that \"you have to finish up, you have to get the job done.\"\n\nTrump with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2020. Foto: Doug Mills/Getty Images\n\nAs president, Trump was even closer with Israel than Biden is, and he took several steps that benefited the Jewish state, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. His administration also recognized the Golan Heights -- a disputed territory claimed by Syria -- as part of Israel.\n\nTrump has also said numerous times that any Jewish person who votes for Biden or other Democrats should \"have their head examined\" -- a missive that many have found offensive, but that signals he would be more staunchly supportive of the country than Biden.\n\nThe former president has also reportedly pledged to deport pro-Palestinian protestors on college campuses.\n\n\"If you get me reelected, we're going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,\" Trump told a group of Jewish donors in May, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhy some voters might cast protest voters -- or stay at home\n\nGiven that Trump is broadly more supportive of Israel, one might expect voters who are concerned about Israel's war in Gaza to vote for Biden.\n\nThat's especially true given that many of the most vocal opponents of Biden's Israel stance are Arab and Muslim Americans, who have long been a scapegoat for Trump's brand of politics. Trump has also made vague pledges to expand upon the so-called \"Muslim ban\" that he enacted when he was president.\n\nBut many voters aren't doing that.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters who might otherwise support Biden have cast \"uncommitted\" ballots in Democratic presidential primaries this year in protest of his handling of the conflict.\n\nWhile a solid chunk of those voters are likely to vote for Biden in the general election anyway, many say they're still waiting to see Biden change course.\n\nSome are even saying it's too late -- that Biden has supported what they consider to be a genocide, and that there's no way they can vote for him again.\n\nFor these voters -- some of whom may have even had family members killed in Gaza -- they argue that the war outweighs all other considerations.\n\nAbdullah Hammoud, the mayor of the predominantly-Arab city of Dearborn in Michigan, told Business Insider in March that even though he believes Biden has been a \"transformative\" president in terms of his domestic agenda, some of his constituents will never vote for Biden now.\n\n\"A genocide outweighs all of this,\" said Hammoud. \"Aiding, abetting, defending, and supporting a genocide outweighs all that transformative legislation.\"\n\nRather than cast votes for Biden or Trump, these voters may simply stay home, or cast so-called \"protest\" votes for third-party candidates who have no chance of winning, such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein or independent candidate Cornel West.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri":

Although they may be \"never Trumpers\" they may either cast ballots for one of the no-hope candidates or boycott the election. This would not only deprive Biden of votes but also cost legislators from his party and turn the 2024 contest into a rout of the Democrats.\n\nTrump was on trial in a Manhattan court on 34 allegations that he falsified business records to conceal a $130,000 payment before the 2016 election to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels. She said she had an affair with him a decade earlier and was prepared to tell her story to the media for a fee. The hush money was paid to Daniels by Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen who was then reimbursed by Trump's firm in instalments labelled legal fees. During the protracted trial, which Trump was obliged to attend, the prosecution had to prove that he had ordered Cohen to falsify business records, thereby violating state and federal laws compelling Triump to declare the $130,000 to be campaign funds.\n\nTrump is also facing criminal felony cases elsewhere: 40 charges in Florida for allegedly stealing classified documents and obstructing the government's efforts to retrieve them, four cases in Washington related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and 13 cases in the state of Georgia over his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election result there.\n\nAnd, he has appealed punishing verdicts in civil cases in New York state over manipulation of company records and defaming journalist E. Jean Carroll who won a multi-million-dollar settlement from him in a case over physical abuse.\n\nAs conviction of low-level felonies does not disqualify Trump from running for the presidency or assuming office, Trump attended court sessions in the morning and campaigned evenings and weekends when the court did not sit.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Trump's slender lead in polls over the past eight months may not be \"quite as stable as it looks.\" His lead, the author the of article Nate Cohn. argued this advantage \"is built on gains among voters who aren't paying close attention to politics, who don't follow traditional news and who don't regularly vote.\" He said these \"disengaged voters\" have not only skewed polls but also contributed to Trumps gains at the ballot box.\n\nThe most significant discovery made by Cohn is that \"disengaged low-turnout voters\" are often from predominantly Democratic constituencies. Many continue to identify as Democratic leaning and still back Democratic candidates for US Senate, but they are...backing away from Mr. Biden in startling numbers\" according to polls conducted by The New York Times.\n\nOther polls show that Biden's 36 per cent approval rating is the lowest since mid-2022. Writing in Britain's conservative Telegraph daily, Washington Post commentator Henry Olsen observed that \"no American president since at least Harry Truman in 1948 has won re-election with such dire polls.\" In Olsen's view, this has driven Biden to challenge Trump to a debate in June before either presumptive candidate is formally nominated by party conventions. Biden seeks to boost \"momentum\" and enter the August Democratic convention \"on an upswing,\" Olsen holds. Trump, he said, inspires \"fear and loathing\" among Democrats, who fear Trump dictatorship, and see Biden's re-election as the means to prevent \"rebellion by leading Democrats\" who would prefer another candidate.\n\nBiden, 81, could achieve \"momentum\" only if he can demonstrate he is more energetic and focused than domineering, flighty Trump, 77. This will be difficult because Biden is visibly \"elderly,\" his speech is often slurred or mushy, he has always been prone to gaffs, and he refuses to budge on unpopular policies.\n\nThe issues most concerning voters are the economy, political extremism, and migration. Biden has been un-convincing when dealing with inflation, curbing extremism and reducing the flow of immigrants across the US border with Mexico.\n\nCommentators also insist that Biden's unconditional support for Israel in the Gaza war is a key factor dividing Democrats. Many are increasingly concerned over his stubborn refusal to use Washington's considerable leverage to rein in Israel. His attitude is rooted in his 1970s admiration for Israel. Biden's devotion has not changed over half a century although popular perceptions of Israel have eroded due to its enduring, punitive occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza and the refusal of Israel's increasingly right-wing leaders to cede 22 per cent of Palestinian land to a Palestinian state in exchange for Arab-Israeli peace.\n\nTo make matters worse for Biden, his stance has been seriously undermined by last week's announcement by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court that he would seek arrest warrants for alleged war crimes for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and the demand by the International Court of Justice for an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza's Rafah province.\n\nBy contrast, Trump, another strong supporter of Israel, has hedged his bets to a certain extent. He has warned Israel it is \"losing the PR [public relations] war\" in Gaza because of horrendous media images of the destruction of buildings being bombed in Gaza. He told Israel to finish the war \"fast.\" In an interview, he refused to say he was 100 per cent behind Israel. Having insisted he won the 2022 election, Trump has criticised Netanyahu who said Biden was legally elected at that time.\n\nTrump is determined never to be a \"loser.\" He may have a good second chance not to be a \"loser\" again in November's presidential election.

Those concerns were seemingly validated when, weeks before the March State of the Union, special counsel Robert Hur judged the president would come across as a \"well-meaning, elderly man\" in his classified documents case.\n\nBiden delivered an energetic, stump-style speech that helped tamp down a brewing Democratic panic. But the Biden campaign continues to be dogged by months of polling showing him behind in his presidential rematch with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden is taking a gamble with his decision to debate the former president twice before the November election. The first debate, set for June 27, could reinforce the same narrative about his age if he does not meet the low expectations of lucidity set for him.\n\nHowever, Democrats were encouraged by his State of the Union and are counting on him to deliver a similar performance at the first debate.\n\n\"He gave a great State of the Union. He knocked it out of the park. And I think that's the hope with the Democrats, and our belief is that he's going to rise to the occasion in this June debate,\" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a progressive surrogate for the Biden campaign.\n\nPolitical spectators question whether a debate this early will have a lasting impact on the presidential race. In 2020, Biden and Trump did not appear onstage with one another until September.\n\nBut for the Democrats, it represents what could be the beginning of a reset. Biden is trailing Trump in nearly every battleground state. In Nevada, the polling gap is as large as 13 points.\n\nThose numbers are, at least publicly, regarded with a degree of skepticism. Democrats predict the election will be exceptionally close, just as it was in 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut the Biden campaign has sought to put to rest concerns from party insiders that he could lose in November. At least one Democratic operative in close contact with the White House described the mood as an unmitigated \"freakout,\" according to Politico.\n\nThe State of the Union largely surprised Washington lawmakers. Biden not only avoided major stumbles, but he also landed shots at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), a boogeyman for Democrats, and other Republicans jeering him from the audience.\n\nMore importantly, it helped the White House move past the Hur report. Biden would not face prosecution, but interview transcripts released to the public showed him forgetting details including the years he served as vice president and when his son Beau died.\n\nThe State of the Union, given once a year before a joint session of Congress, is normally highly scripted affair in which the president lays out his priorities for the remainder of his term. But Biden used the event as a de facto campaign rally, mentioning his \"predecessor\" more than a dozen times across his 67-minute speech.\n\nBiden runs the risk of fumbling in a more volatile debate setting. However, Biden emerged largely unscathed from his two debates with Trump in 2020, despite Trump's attempts to goad and rattle him.\n\nDemocrats say the State of the Union provides fresh evidence he will do well.\n\n\"Strong. Focused. Knew the issues,\" Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the former House majority leader, said of Biden's speech. \"I think that's what he's going to be at the debate. I think that's why they're having a debate this early.\"\n\nThe June debate has been structured in such a way as to minimize risk to Biden. Trump agreed to the president's request that it be held in a studio, without a live audience, while it is being hosted by CNN, seen as a friendly outlet to Biden.\n\nBiden will have another chance to dispel concerns with his speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, while he agreed to hold a second debate with Trump, this one hosted by ABC, on Sept. 10.\n\n\"He's got three big opportunities. And I think he's gonna move the needle there,\" said Khanna.\n\nBut the June debate, in particular, will be held early enough that if Biden performs poorly, it will have largely receded into the background by Election Day.\n\nDemocrats have bristled at the continued attempts to paint Biden as in cognitive decline, noting Trump is only a few years younger. Voters routinely cite Biden's age as a worry in public polling, but the GOP has also attempted to magnify, and at times distort, his verbal slip-ups.\n\nOn Thursday, the party's research arm posted a clip on X of Biden, who has largely overcome a childhood stutter, appearing to call his vice president \"President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nThe debate poses the risk that Biden will give Republicans fresh ammunition. Yet Democrats also acknowledge the GOP portrayal gives Biden a chance to exceed expectations in high-profile moments.\n\n\"His speech at the State of the Union was good under any circumstances, but they, frankly, made it even better by the way they had been talking him down before it,\" said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), who debated Mike Pence as Hillary Clinton's vice presidential nominee in 2016.\n\n\"And I have no reason to think that the debate won't be similar,\" Kaine added. \"I wouldn't do too much trash-talking in advance.\"\n\nRepublicans acknowledge there is a danger in setting expectations low for Biden. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), who is on Trump's vice presidential short list, considers Biden's State of the Union performance a \"cautionary tale\" for Republicans.\n\n\"I mean, look, sometimes Biden has good days and sometimes he has bad days. And you don't want to get in a situation where he has a good day and blows away expectations,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's easy for anybody to be on for an hour and a half,\" he added.\n\nTrump has seemingly attempted to reset expectations for the debates, claiming if Biden does well, it is because he is on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\n\"He's going to be so jacked up for those, you watch,\" Trump alleged earlier this month in remarks before the National Rifle Association. He has previously said without evidence that Biden was \"high as a kite\" during his State of the Union.\n\nSome Hill lawmakers expressed a heavy dose of skepticism that these and other milestones in the presidential race will do much to change the dynamic.\n\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-MI), a retiring congressman from the swing state of Michigan, predicted the independent voters who will decide the election are not going to be the ones plugged into the debate performances.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who debated Trump in the 2016 presidential primary, said voters' perception of Biden are already set and won't be changed by a single debate performance.\n\nIndeed, a snap poll taken after the second presidential debate in 2020 found that viewers did not walk away with a materially different assessment of Trump or Biden. The president did not see a polling bump in the days after his State of the Union, either.\n\n\"It could reinforce what people have already seen,\" Rubio said of Biden. \"But I don't think he's gonna go in there and light the world on fire and change everybody's mind about what they have seen from him over the last three and a half years.\"\n\n\"These aren't two people running for sheriff,\" he added. \"They're pretty well known.\"\n\nA debate does not only pose risks for Biden. In 2020, Trump was perceived as having been too combative in their first debate, while Democrats are banking on him treating the debate stage like a campaign rally.\n\n\"He goes into weird tangents that are kind of really hard to understand what's going on,\" said Kaine. \"Will he do that in a debate? We'll see.\"\n\nNonetheless, the debates are widely regarded as a bigger liability for Biden. Republicans generally believe the president would not have accepted them if he were not behind in the polls. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has attempted to cast Biden as afraid to appear onstage by demanding additional debates beyond the two.\n\nKildee suggested the debate is a chance for Biden to overcome what he sees as a gap between public perception and his own experience with the president.\n\n\"I mean, I know him. I've talk to him for hours on end,\" Kildee said. \"If he could just present that Joe Biden, I don't have any problem at all.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nKhanna, the Biden surrogate, tacitly acknowledged the president is behind by giving a positive spin to his underdog status. He pointed to Biden's performance in vice presidential debates as Barack Obama's running mate, plus his two debates against Trump.\n\n\"Somehow, he always is underestimated. And I think in many ways, he's like Harry Truman,\" Khanna said of Biden, referring to the 33rd president's upset victory in 1948. \"As president, he is underestimated -- he's going to be coming from behind in the polls, but he'll win.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_sivak@washingtonexaminer.com",

President Joe Biden is unpopular -- his latest approval ratings are in the mid-30s, perilous territory for an incumbent seeking a second term -- and if the election were held now he almost surely would lose to his predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nThat reality makes the June 27 debate between Biden and Trump far more critical for the president than his challenger. But it matters greatly for both men, potentially allowing Trump to command his podium and recover from those unflattering courtroom pictures of an impotent man. Indeed, a good case can be made that this will be the most consequential single presidential debate in living memory.\n\nThe unusually early date for a debate was set at the Biden campaign's insistence. That's indicative of how much Biden and his team recognize the severity of his situation and view the debate as a chance to reverse his fortunes.\n\nWhy Biden is viewed so negatively is a contested matter. Clearly, his advanced age is a major political liability. Democrats quickly respond that Trump is merely four years younger than Biden, and also showing signs his age is catching up with him. But a majority of American voters, for whatever reason, seem to believe it's a bigger issue for Biden than Trump, who usually appears to be more energetic. Likewise, perceptions of the health of the economy are hurting Biden.\n\nThere's also intense disagreement about whether the polls accurately reflect the current state of play. Biden campaign officials, and the president himself, generally have been dismissive, arguing that pollsters' track records over the tumultuous time beginning in 2016 haven't been all that reliable.\n\nThe debate is occurring early enough that, should Biden stumble badly, Democrats still will have time before their August convention to consider internally whether the president is their best chance for holding the White House. The chances of that happening currently are very slim indeed, but that's not stopping the conjecture.\n\nThere is still a chance that the Chicago convention in August will be more exciting than we think.\n\nNo Democratic presidents running for reelection since Jimmy Carter has experienced the kind of skepticism and anxiety with which Biden now must contend. Carter faced a bitterly personal primary challenge from Ted Kennedy that lasted until the Democratic convention. Before Carter, Lyndon Johnson famously bowed out in the middle of the primaries in 1968 as the Vietnam War raged.\n\nBiden, of course, shows no signs of repeating Johnson's 11th-hour exit. But it should be disquieting to Democrats that Biden's recent approval rating of 36% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published May 21 actually is 2 points lower than Carter's popularity at the same point in his presidency. Everyone knows what happened in November of 1980.\n\nIt's Biden's good fortune that his opponent isn't Ronald Reagan -- or someone with those political skills. It's Donald Trump, who arguably carries more baggage than any major-party nominee in American history.\n\nBut the concern for Democrats at this point is that the public's views of Biden are more or less locked in. It's striking that Democratic Senate candidates in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Nevada are outperforming Biden's polling by high single digits or more. The polling data suggests that Biden's issues are specific to his candidacy for the presidency rather than a reflection of how Americans perceive the Democratic Party as a whole.\n\nBiden must repeat what he achieved at his State of the Union address in March when he vigorously delivered a spirited -- pugnacious even -- defense of his record. He must do so while sitting across from a rival he clearly detests and taking care not to be thrown off his game by the typical debate chaos Trump likes to create.\n\nPresidential debates are always highly anticipated affairs. But often they don't live up to the advance excitement, and election arcs don't change much afterward. That may happen again with the first Biden-Trump square-off in spite of the higher-than-normal stakes.\n\nIf it does, that will spell big trouble for Biden. Come next month, he will need a knockout victory under those conditions of his own choosing.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

To finish it up. You gotta get it done,\" he told the Israeli newspaper Israel Hayom in March. The next month he told the conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt that Israel is \"absolutely losing the PR war\" and that the country should \"get it over with and let's get back to peace and stop killing people.\"\n\nSome newspapers and political analysts interpreted Trump's comments as more critical of Israel's strategy than President Joe Biden has been -- and possibly more dovish. \"Trump arguably went a step further than Biden, who hasn't explicitly called for an end to the war,\" Axios reported in response to Trump's March comments. Some right-wing supporters of Israel's military operation saw Trump's comments as a shift away from unconditional support of Israel.\n\nBut recent events should make it clear that it was naive to believe that Trump could be moving to Biden's left on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump's informal attempts at reaching out to the Arab American community have seemingly floundered. And behind closed doors he has reportedly told donors that he plans to repress pro-Palestinian activists with unprecedented zeal.\n\nAll this tracks with Trump's ultra-hawkish presidential record on Israel, which undoubtedly would continue with similar intensity if he returns to the White House. And it's a reminder that those who hope that Trump might provide some kind of preferable alternative to Biden's abhorrent complicity in Israel's brutalization of Gaza are misguided.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump's former ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, met with about 40 Arab American leaders at a restaurant in Michigan to pitch them on why they should vote for Trump. (Trump's campaign has said the meeting was \"not authorized, sanctioned or requested\" by Trump or his campaign, but it acknowledged that the campaign is doing outreach to Arab Americans as a \"disaffected voting bloc.\" Trump has referred to Grenell as \"my envoy.\") NOTUS reports that Grenell's pitch wasn't well-received by many in attendance. According to two attendees, Grenell didn't appear \"sufficiently disturbed by the loss of Palestinian lives\" and \"seemed more concerned about how Arab American leaders in Michigan could help the Trump campaign rather than how the Trump campaign could help them.\" Grenell also reiterated Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's shocking talking point about how Gaza could be developed into a waterfront property. And there's nothing in the report -- or Trump's policy record -- that suggests Trump would be prepared to work with Arab American leaders on their reported goals, such as restoring funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (which Trump defunded when he was in office).\n\nIn other words, while Grenell reached out to members of a voting bloc that has threatened to sit out of the election or defect from Biden, he didn't make a pitch that substantively addressed their core priority: ending U.S. support for Israel's ongoing destruction and starvation of Gaza.\n\nA Washington Post report published Monday shows that Trump isn't just uninterested in substantively catering to voters sympathetic to Palestinians, but that he wants to repress them. The Post reports that, according to donors who attended a May event, Trump said he wanted to aggressively crack down on pro-Palestinian protests and set the movement \"back 25 or 30 years\" through the force of his repression. He also, strangely, threatened to deport protesters -- perhaps out of the inaccurate belief that the bulk of them are foreign students.\n\nTrump's shoddy, superficial outreach to Arab American leaders and leaks of his true designs for pro-Palestinian activists aren't surprising. The former president specializes in shallow, offensive attempts to win over Democratic-leaning constituencies -- such as his absurd use of rappers charged with gang crimes to try to win over Black voters.\n\nAny hopes that Trump will transform into a moderate or a dove on Israel are naive. His presidency was marked by a remarkable alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, including shifting the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and cutting off funding to UNRWA. And recently Trump seems to be approaching Netanyahu's radical position on rejecting a two-state solution. If Trump had been in power when Israel responded to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks, it's safe to say he would've put even less pressure on Netanyahu than Biden did, if any. And his presence in the White House would likely embolden Netanyahu even further. Comments like \"You gotta get it done\" don't suggest minimizing the conflict's toll. They most likely reflect Trump's thinking that Netanyahu should simply pursue his indiscriminate campaign in Gaza with even more speed and even less restraint, to minimize the time that the global community spends scrutinizing the war.\n\nIn short, Trump has backed no policy or made any meaningful commitment in support of freeing Palestinians from occupation or protecting them from brutalization. It is irresponsible to assume that's what he could mean unless he says it.\n\nThe truth of Trump's attitude toward Israel's war shouldn't leave Biden relaxed about Arab American voters or progressives incensed over Gaza. While it seems unlikely that they would defect en masse to the bigoted author of the Muslim immigrant ban, there's still a real risk that many will stay at home. And the argument that \"the other guy would be worse\" isn't going to work on a lot of people who are paying attention and deeply distraught. When the premier human rights observers of the world are calling Israel's operation genocidal, then Biden's policy of supporting it while making minor objections to it are not going to matter to many; this is not a scenario where \"better\" is morally tolerable to many. The moral policy here would incidentally also be good politics: end U.S. complicity, and recognize the humanity of Palestinians.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She's also been urging her 20-year-old son's friends to register to vote.\n\nCampaign officials say the encounter is exactly what they are hoping to replicate around the country with a series of small-scale campaign events.\n\nBiden, 81, has spent decades honing his 'retail' politician style of wooing voters. Big, thundering speeches have never been his style but he lights up when meeting people one-on-one, thumping shoulders, hugging strangers and FaceTiming people's moms.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the mass rallies hosted by Republican rival Donald Trump -- heavy on stagecraft with classic rock playlists, anti-immigration rhetoric and mostly white audiences -- Biden meets with small, more diverse groups of voters for personal conversations.\n\nThose smaller events are arranged with friendly invitation-only audiences, and often publicized only at the last minute to avoid pro-Palestinian protests that have dogged Biden's appearances for months.\n\nIt's part of a broader campaign strategy that includes celebrity endorsements, a slew of political surrogates, traditional ads and official events to showcase Biden's support for NATO, infrastructure funding and other key policies.\n\nThe campaign is under heavy pressure as Biden wobbles in the polls.\n\nDespite strong economic growth and stock market highs, his approval ratings are near two-year lows, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, and other polls show Trump ahead in several of the battleground states that Biden narrowly won in 2020.\n\nCampaign and Democratic party officials say that is in part because voters are still smarting from higher prices and don't know enough about what Biden has done to reduce costs of prescription drugs and other essentials, or his backing of unions fighting for higher wages.\n\nThey say U.S. media is too \"fractured\" to be an effective way of reaching voters on these issues. So they're enlisting friend networks, super-surrogates, small business groups, podcasts, new media and TikTok stars who they hope will talk issues and policies as they try to convince millions of Americans to back Biden in November.\n\nCharles Franklin, who directs polling at Wisconsin's Marquette University Law School, said that because Biden doesn't have \"groupies\" like Trump, these smaller events are a better bet. \"If they both got the same stadium and did back to back events, [I'm] pretty confident that Trump would have the bigger turnout for that,\" Franklin said.\n\nRepublicans, who ridiculed Biden's 2020 campaign for being run \"from his basement,\" say the lack of big Biden rallies in 2024 is further evidence of his physical and political fragility.\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, described Biden's strategy as \"tiny, staged, 15-minute snooze-fests,\" and said \"Team Trump's campaign events will continue to get bigger and better.\"\n\nBIDEN AT THE FRIDGE Before events like the one in Racine, the campaign combs its databases for local people who care about a specific issue Biden's policies have addressed or are part of a demographic he hopes to reach, and invites them to meet Biden. Sometimes they find unexpected guests like Dyess.\n\nThe interactions are filmed by the campaign for YouTube video and campaign ads, and followed by local and national media. Ideally, participants make their own social media posts and those go viral, reaching more voters, the campaign says.\n\n\"One of the strategies around any visit is not just to have the perfect room and create the conditions for serendipity, but also to make sure that what happens in the room doesn't stay in the room,\" said Ben Wikler, head of Wisconsin's Democratic Party.\n\nIn Milwaukee in March, for example, Biden met 9-year-old Harry Abramson, who had written to Biden about his stutter.\n\nBiden, who stuttered as a child, shared his strategy for dealing with difficult words. The interaction was picked up by the local Fox affiliate and other TV stations, digital and print media, and Biden's campaign put it on Facebook and other accounts. It went viral, bouncing around chat rooms, TikTok and Reddit.\n\n\"Grandpa's gonna Grandpa. Imagine telling your friends you got speech lessons from the president of the United States,\" one Reddit user wrote under a video of the interaction on \"Made Me Smile,\" a group with 9.5 million members.\n\nBiden visited the Fitts' family home in North Carolina in January, part of a 'kitchen table' visit to regular families in swing states. Afterward, teenaged Christian Fitts posted a video on TikTokNew Tab, opens new tab showing the President admiring school photos on his refrigerator and sharing french fries at the kitchen table.\n\nThe post got over one million \"likes\" and thousands of comments that attracted millions more views. Many were incredulous, rather than outright endorsements of Biden. \"HIM JUST STANDING AT THE FRIDGE IS SENDING ME\" one user wrote. Nearly 50,000 people liked the comment.\n\nNOVEMBER IMPACT IS UNCLEAR\n\nTracking the digital impact of this strategy is difficult, political experts say. New tools to track TikTok content are still not reliable, most Facebook posts are private, and there's no way to know how many of those who comment will actually vote.\n\nTeddy Goff, co-founder of marketing firm Precision Strategies, believes the smaller events are a smart play.\n\n\"They're going to wind up in the local news, local newspaper, local TV, and in all likelihood, will get seen by more people than might have been to that Trump rally,\" said Goff, digital director of former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, referring to an April rally by Trump in Green Bay that drew a crowd of 3,200.\n\nRelying on individuals to share the Biden message can be unpredictable.\n\nSheree Robinson, a Black mother of five from Racine who says funding from Biden's American Rescue Plan helped her earn her a High School Equivalency Diploma, was invited to ride in Biden's limousine during his May Wisconsin visit.\n\nShe posted a video on Facebook showing her smiling next to a bemused-looking Biden, as he gets detailed instructions on what to expect at the next event. In her comment, she used an obscenity to tout herself as a \"big ... deal,\" without any praise of Biden.\n\nLater, however, she called into a local radio program to share what she called an \"awesome\" experience, and plugged Biden's policy that helped her get a degree. The Wisconsin Democratic party is featuring her in digital ads it will use around the state.\n\nSocial media tends to embrace more negative or awkward moments, like a stumble or fall, Goff noted, rather than a tiny event like the recent one in Racine.\n\nBiden's campaign is outspending Trump's on digital media in Wisconsin, according to an analysis by Priorities USA. It spent $2.2 million on digital ads in the state alone since January, compared to $1,500 spent by Trump.\n\nSo far, though, a FiveThirtyEight compilation of Wisconsin polls still shows Trump with a slight lead in the state.\n\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Heather Timmons and Claudia Parsons", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But everyone with \"TDS\" thinks Trump should be convicted.\n\nRobert DeNiro admitted to TDS in his very weird meltdown outside the courthouse Tuesday when the actor proclaimed he knows Trump is guilty. DeNiro is not alone in voicing their limitless hatred of Trump. More people on X than can be counted have TDS. Many folks commenting on this or any other column about Trump have TDS.\n\nJURY BEGINS DELIBERATIONS IN NY V. TRUMP TRIAL AS FORMER PRESIDENT BLASTS CHARGES AS 'RIGGED'\n\nBut the marker of TDS is not an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Trump in this proceeding. Thinking Trump guilty isn't an insane position and can be in many cases put down to simple ignorance of the law.\n\nA lot of observers haven't been following Andrew C. McCarthy or Jonathan Turley as they have both patiently explained, again and again, why the trial is hard to stomach for people committed to the rule of law. Lots of people catch just a few minutes of coverage or this and that and come to some erroneous conclusion such as \"NDAs are illegal\" or are wholly ignorant of the fact that Bragg has no jurisdiction over the enforcement of federal election law.\n\nThey will just have heard or watched or read enough to conclude that paying off Stormy Daniels was illegal and Trump got caught doing that. They are neither joyful nor disappointed by the verdict, whatever it will be. These citizens are not the problem for politics in this country. The problem for the country is that too many people are emotionally invested in \"put Trump in cuffs\" regardless of the facts or the law.\n\nFolks with TDS, in contrast to those who have simply been misled or who are ignorant of things like \"reasonable doubt,\" will actually know this case should never have been brought though they will be loath to admit that out loud. They know it's a bizarre proceeding from start to finish and that the trial Judge Juan Merchan didn't just put a finger on the scale to benefit the prosecution but that he slammed his fist down on it again and again and again on the side of Bragg and his team.\n\nMerchan will never regain whatever reputation he had for fairness, though he will often hear going forward from the TDS-afflicted how glad they were that he bent the rule of law to try and injure Trump.\n\nSuch praise will be the equivalent of cheering for a bonfire that got out of control when offered by the pyromaniacs who happened to pass by such an accidental blaze. According to Psychology Today, pyromaniacs \"do not set fires for monetary gain, for ideological reasons, to cover up criminal activity, to express anger or revenge, or as a result of a delusion, a hallucination, or impaired judgment.\" Why do they start fires? This gets us close to understanding the TDS-afflicted.\n\n\"Some research has likened pyromania and other impulse-control disorders to behavioral addictions,\" was the explanation provided. The TDS-afflicted seem to me to be simply addicted to hating Trump. The origin of their animus is beside the point.\n\nMaybe Trump disintermediated them from power, influence or money. Maybe they got the short end of a deal somewhere along the line, and they are transferring their anger over that perceived injustice on to Trump. A generalization about the origins of a psychological condition does not seem fair or even possibly accurate.\n\nThe deep hatred of Trump among those with TDS is really quite startling to observe or hear, especially for the first time from someone you may like or respect. A mention of Trump sets a TDSer off of course, sends them into a rant or over a rhetorical cliff and sometimes they manifest their addiction by raising their voice, clenching fists, resorting to profanity or vulgarity or using ALL CAPS! They obsess about Trump and turn every topic to him. He's not, for them, a political opponent in the great game of American politics, but a Putin-Assad-Xi-Sinwar-level embodiment of evil.\n\nThat's objectively not true, of course, but they will argue that \"Yes, Trump is!\" or that at least that he's close. Even if obliged to give up the ground that Trump hasn't committed genocide or mass murder of innocents, they will append some qualifier to that admission and mutter something about \"lack of opportunity.\"\n\nHow to tell if somebody has TDS? Listen for the venom-saturated commentary, the startling level of hatred they express. It just isn't normal, not even for brass-knuckled politicos. Trump breaks people. Most stay broken.\n\nNot liking Trump, or even really, really disliking him -- disliking him to a level you have never felt about a politician -- is not TDS. Indeed, even what appears to be an obsession with Trump is, for some, simply an economic choice.\n\nMSNBC producers know a good slice of their relatively small audience must be fed daily some extravagant venting about Trump. They know they can't put on the other point of view much less a hardcore MAGA Trump supporter. Too many in their audience are repulsed by any praise of Trump or his record. That's not TDS. That's monetizing the TDS in the population at large, even though it's a small percentage of Americans.\n\nAs I wrote this column, the jury was deliberating. I've been telling my broadcast audience for two months that a conviction was coming because the trial judge tipped his hand very early and has done everything in his power to \"get Trump.\" I am also convinced the conviction will be reversed on appeal for many reasons, but that the appeal will take much longer than the election season. Even then, it won't undo the damage done to this election cycle by the fanatics who threw in with Bragg.\n\nThe idea that President Joe Biden sent his official campaign to the courthouse to cheer on a conviction via DeNiro's ranting should stun people. The president of the United States should want justice done, not a political opponent convicted because the incumbent's campaign seems to be collapsing. Neither the president nor DeNiro can possibly have an informed opinion about the trial because they haven't been in the courtroom and show no evidence of following the serious and objective analysis. They just want Trump in cuffs.\n\nWhy? Well Joe Biden wants to be reelected and who knows what drives a very old actor for whom the sun is setting. There are dozens of different origin stories for TDS but my view is that, for most with the condition, the exercise of the rage against Trump releases some sort of endorphin for the folks trapped in it.\n\nSome sort of psychological return on investment must be garnered by, for example, obsessively replying to posts on X or columns in various platforms that point out the many biased rulings by Merchan. Nobody reads those threads except other TDS-afflicted people. Nobody's opinion changes. But the compulsion to comment and rage endures.\n\nThe only figures from the modern era remotely close to Trump in the ability to trigger sustained rage among his or her political opponents are Richard Nixon and Hillary Clinton. It's a small group of people in American politics who see in an individual elected in the United States a \"super villain.\" Our republic functions well. We don't let super villains rule.\n\nRealize, though, there is no arguing with those with TDS, no persuading them of their condition. I have tentatively approached some folks who voted for President Biden in 2020 with the question whether they will consider voting for Trump in 2024. It's an obvious question to pose to folks who like to talk politics.\n\nA surprising number of them have said yes, but that it's far from a sure thing. They don't like Trump at all, for any of a number of reasons. Most in this group of fence-sitters cite unsurprising reasons for their tentative change of heart: Biden's manifest physical infirmity, or their conclusion that Vice President Harris will end up president if Biden wins in the fall, or because the national security staff around Biden is so utterly averse to conflict and thus have left America weak and unable to deter out energies.\n\nThey would gladly vote for another Democrat like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro or Colorado Governor Jared Polis. But when pushed to face the real choice -- Biden or Trump -- they are either undecided or already in the \"Trump is better than 'old Joe.'\"\n\nThe key: None of these people have TDS. They are puzzling though the inevitable binary choice.\n\nTDS is not widespread. Most Americans just don't care enough to hate Trump 24/7/365. And they shouldn't. Trump isn't a \"threat to democracy,\" and isn't, as DeNiro asserted repeatedly, \"never going to leave!\" if returned to the White House. Of course, he will leave.\n\nThe two-term limit is in the Constitution and the Constitution is very strong. It's just crazy talk to make such a wild assertion to the contrary. But that's the point: TDS is crazy talk that never ends in the inner dialogue of the minds of the TDS-afflicted.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nThis is why I fear conviction in a case that is, manifestly, an abuse of the criminal justice system -- a political prosecution. I am assuming that some of the jurors have TDS. I'm also assuming that there will be no reasoning with them and that they will descend to berating anyone who sees the reality of this absurd set of charges and assumptions on top of assumptions. If there is more than one TDSer, it's going to be a rough time for any juror who thinks Trump is getting railroaded and that the prosecution didn't come close to carrying their burden of proof.\n\nThe idea that President Joe Biden sent his official campaign to the courthouse to cheer on a conviction via DeNiro's ranting should stun people. The president of the United States should want justice done, not a political opponent convicted because the incumbent's campaign seems to be collapsing. Neither the president nor DeNiro can possibly have an informed opinion about the trial because they haven't been in the courtroom and show no evidence of following the serious and objective analysts. They just want Trump in cuffs.\n\nI've only sat as a member of one criminal jury. (Lawyers on juries is not routine, but it's also not as rare as some commentators have suggested.) The dynamics in that particular room, which went on for two weeks and ended in a hung jury of 11-1 in favor of conviction, were quite unlike anything you've ever seen in a movie or on any platform. I tell my law students on the basis of that experience that they can never underestimate the stupidity, the unmovable bias or pure irrationality of the most ignorant person on the jury.\n\nIf any of the Trump jurors has TDS, and especially if more than one does, but there is also a principled individual who sees through the smoke, this could go a very long time. If you know anyone with TDS, you also know that the last thing you want is to be trapped next to them on an airplane or, God forbid, in a jury room.\n\nOne more consideration causes concern for this jury. To this manic desire among TDSers to \"stop Trump,\" add in the dangerous lure of \"the call of significance\" which Commentary Magazine Executive Editor Abe Greenwald articulated in that magazine's Wednesday podcast.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I just don't see,\" Greenwald explained, \"how a New York jury can resist the opportunity -- in their eyes a world historic opportunity -- to convict Donald Trump and, in their mind, shape the course of the upcoming presidential election and American history.\" TDS is the obvious threat to a fair deliberation. The less obvious but also real temptation is to indulge the desire to be in on the first ever conviction of a former president -- to \"make history.\"\n\nTDS, plus the powerful attraction of being a footnote in history, is almost certainly going to bend this jury. I hope for our collective sake, including those with TDS, that there's a \"Juror #8\" -- Henry Fonda in \"12 Angry Men\" -- in the room. If there is, he or she will be celebrated down the years.

And the most effective way to do so, other than reliable and widespread polling, is to examine the candidate's schedule. Where advisers choose to invest time and treasure is perhaps most indicative of their genuine view of their candidate's strengths and weaknesses and where he needs to secure his base or expand his reach. Ultimately, wittingly or unwittingly, it reveals an optimistic or pessimistic outlook on the race.\n\nTo use an extreme example, if Joe Biden needs to travel to deep-blue California to secure that state or Donald Trump feels it necessary to campaign in ruby-red Mississippi, it is an unmistakable sign that his campaign is going off the rails. To that point, when Joe Biden announced a new initiative, the rather stark \"Black Voters for Biden-Harris\" in Philadelphia on Wednesday, he was trying to win back support from his most crucial demographic group, one that should have been locked down by now. Having to invest so much of his limited energy to securing his base is an ominous sign for a campaign that should be thinking of ways to expand its appeal by this point in the campaign.\n\nIn light of the incumbent's travel plans, or lack thereof, the Biden re-election campaign and its champions in elite media are now essentially admitting that the president will have to win all three battleground states of the upper Midwest -- Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin -- to secure a second term. Unless all polling to date is wrong, as Biden constantly suggests, or a Trump conviction in his Manhattan trial changes the contours of the race, Biden's path to four more years is undoubtedly narrow. The president's campaign is now desperate enough to send the 80-year-old, Trump-deranged Robert De Niro out on Tuesday (May 28) for a rambling, unhinged rant in front of the Manhattan courthouse where Trump's trial had entered its final stages, declaring Trump is out to destroy the world.\n\nConversely, if a candidate makes bold moves to appear in regions where his opponent is the clear favorite, it demonstrates optimism about his prospects. And, despite a legal Sword of Damocles hanging over his head, that has been the case of late with Donald Trump.\n\nOf course, New York is hardly in play, but Biden's lead there is just 9 points, down from 22 one year ago in polling by Siena, after he crushed Trump by 23 points in the Empire State in 2020. That shrunken advantage is certainly indicative of the national trend, and in response to his slim path to victory, this president has become almost an unofficial resident of Pennsylvania, just a short ride from his home in Delaware. The state is considered a bellwether for the nation writ large, and Biden established his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia in 2020. On Wednesday he made his fifth trip to the City of Brotherly Love and seventh to Pennsylvania in 2024 alone. Vice President Kamala Harris also has campaigned in the Keystone State three times in the last several weeks.\n\nBut as is so often the case, Biden had nothing on his calendar Tuesday, and after his appearance in Philadelphia, he is headed back to the beach again for the weekend, bringing again into question the seeming lack of urgency from a candidate who is clearly losing the race with just over five months until Election Day.\n\nIndeed, the walls have been closing in on the incumbent, with four other states universally considered pivotal to the outcome of the election -- North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada -- seemingly out of Biden's reach at this point. This leaves the president no choice but to spend most of his time in the trio of upper Midwest battlegrounds he needs to sweep. Together with the states he won before and is likely to win again, sweeping Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin would get Biden to 269 electoral votes, and he would then need to either pull off a big upset in a red state or capture a decisive 270th vote in Nebraska, where one of the state's four votes is up for grabs in the most Democrat district in an otherwise deep-red state.\n\nIn sharp contrast, while it seemed being locked down in Manhattan might cripple his campaign, Trump has taken full advantage of his persecution, speaking daily to the cameras and directly to audiences ordinarily hostile to Republicans. He has drawn an outsized crowd of more than 100,000 in blue New Jersey - Biden leads in the Garden State by 7%, after he won there by 16% in 2020 -- plus an almost unthinkable 20,000 or more in the midnight-blue Bronx, while adding in stops at a union gathering and a Manhattan bodega. And while the left mocks Trump for visiting places he has little or no hope of winning, the former president has demonstrated to the electorate his willingness to talk to anyone, anywhere, anytime, friendly or hostile, while Biden remains distant from the people.\n\n\"President Trump goes to the bright-blue Bronx and another political party's convention [Libertarian], a week before that he goes to bright-blue Minnesota, and before that, he has stops at the Teamsters headquarters and SneakerCon and even a town hall on CNN during the Republican primary,\" campaign adviser Jason Miller texted Politico over the weekend. \"What's now clear is that President Trump is changing the game and living in what normally would be considered Joe Biden's political territory, and this has to terrify Democrats.\"\n\nPolitical history is replete with lost opportunities, missing what was in plain sight, and failed gambits such as De Niro's clumsy attack that broke Biden's explicit promise to avoid commenting on the legal travails of his opponent. Al Gore was blasted for ignoring and losing his home state of Tennessee, costing him the 2000 election. Vice President Dick Cheney was sent 5,000 miles to Hawaii on the eve of the 2004 election in a failed attempt to secure the deep blue state's three electoral votes, though he and Bush 43 still won re-election In 2012, Mitt Romney behaved as if he had a shot at Pennsylvania by holding a rally in Pittsburgh on Election Day itself, only to lose the state decisively.\n\nThen there was 2016, when Hillary Clinton's famous overconfidence and inattention to Wisconsin and Michigan, while spending time and money in states she was set up to lose, was blamed for her crushing losses behind the one-time \"blue wall.\" That year, pundits spoke of Trump having to pull an \"inside straight\" to upset the heavily favored former first lady, senator, and secretary of state. He somehow pulled it off, and, ironically, that is exactly what Biden will have to do now to take down Trump.\n\nThe 45th president, despite being targeted and frozen in place by a nakedly biased judge and bloodthirsty prosecutors, one of whom was sicked on Trump directly from Biden's Justice Department, is brimming with confidence enough to travel directly to the belly of the blue beast. Meanwhile, 46 continues to employ a Rose Garden strategy, acting as if all is well, he is leading, and all he has to do is watch Trump be convicted and keep showing up in Pennsylvania. Trump supporters can only hope he continues down the same path.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

There can be no postponement in their system, barring a catastrophe. The following represents my projections of the race between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nIt is a very confusing situation that in many ways defies logic. In the 1960s and '70s, the Western World - mainly the US, Canada, the UK, inclusive of Western Europe - basically, ridiculed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the age of their leaders, most of whom appeared to be old, being well over 70 years old. With Biden and Trump in the current race, the world's most advanced economy has taken a leaf straight out of the former Soviet's book.\n\nBiden's physical appearance doesn't give the impression that he will be able to complete a second term. He appears to be growing more and more frail as each year passes. The fact that he is under ever-increasing scrutiny by the media, who report every mishap whether justified or not, puts the elderly president under an enormous amount of pressure, and he is determined to prove otherwise.\n\nI think he should just be himself; people respect age and the issues that go with it. Biden might just be better off admitting his 'frailties' and allowing his intellectual capacity and track record to be the elements most focused on by the public. His PR staff should be able to do this quite easily.\n\nTrump is also ageing rapidly, and he does not appear to be as energetic as he was in the 2016 campaign and during his four-year term as president. The records attest to the fact that he is also having mishaps, but for some reason, these are not readily reported by mainstream media. Is there media bias? This is worth looking into.\n\nApart from the mishaps, there is an enormous legal albatross resting upon his shoulders, which he is desperately trying to shake off before November this year. There is no doubt, too, in any sensible person's mind, that Trump has a difficulty with the truth and is increasingly power hungry. These are attributes that stand out a mile. Why would any sane individual consider this candidate for a second time in office? I really can't explain as I am not American.\n\nBiden has signified his willingness to carry the torch for the Democrats. He has no rival now and is not likely to have any going forward. The president is, however, working assiduously to lose the election for his party.\n\nThe Israeli-Palestine conflict in Gaza is rapidly causing the Democrats to become embroiled in a situation that can only be disastrous for them due to the government's unwavering support for genocidal atrocities and other breaches of international law by Israel.\n\nThe essence of the problem is simply that the US has demonstrated an inability to dictate terms as it did in its heyday, when it 'ruled the roost', so to speak. It cannot control Israel, it is not winning the war for the Ukraine, it has lost influence throughout the Arab countries, and it shies away from making any solid commitments in Haiti. This is a perfect recipe for political suicide.\n\nNow Trump has no concept of the value of foreign relations. His history speaks to establishing friendships with those he believes he can manipulate for his own designs. Governing for Trump revolves around putting himself and his desires first, and everything else, a distant second. He talks a good talk for those likely to benefit from his antics, but clearly, he lacks the ability to think strategically, develop statesmanship, or be taken seriously by his peers across the globe. His legal battles are insurmountable. He has backed himself into a corner with both state and federal systems, and with his team unable to control him, he continuously digs holes for himself.\n\nWhat then do I think will happen or what is the bottom line? The Republicans need to rally around a new candidate before it is too late. Former President Trump is going to be convicted before November 2024, leaving Biden to cross the finish line first, winning his second term. However, for health reasons, he will be able to do only two years, before handing over to his vice president, allowing the Democrats to rally around a much younger figure for 2028! What a political calamity, I am glad I am not American!", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soviet Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/media/article_images/2024/05/30/2787105/7942812.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9608899", "eventUri": "eng-9608899", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

He advises corporate clients on communications strategies in the United States, Latin America, and Africa. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN --\n\nAlthough American voters are the ones who will choose the next president of the United States, people across the globe are watching the developments of this election with great interest. And among those watching most closely are world leaders near and far.\n\nArick Wierson\n\nTunheim\n\nGlobal surveys conducted in recent months have concluded that President Joe Biden enjoys far more international support than former President Donald Trump. Moreover, across a broad swath of high and middle income countries, the percentage of foreigners who said they trust Biden \"to do the right thing regarding world affairs\" was significantly higher than those who said they trusted Trump.\n\nOf course, world leaders have generally stayed mum on the issue of which man they prefer - although I would wager that most favor the status quo over a return to the raucous years of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I am not going out on much of limb by saying that world leaders felt quite uncomfortable with Trump and his reckless foreign policies during his term in office,\" veteran political strategist Hank Sheinkopf told me.\n\n\"Europeans trust Biden and worry whether a possible return of Trump will signal an end to NATO and their ability to count on America to protect them with its nuclear shield and vast military capabilities,\" added Sheinkopf, who has advised on political campaigns in 14 different countries during his storied career.\n\n\"Leaders across Asia are generally worried about what the destabilizing nature of Trump's aggressive stance against China might have in the region. And for leaders in Latin America and Africa, it's no secret that these are areas of the world that Trump doesn't care much about at all,\" he said.\n\n\"To sum it up, unless we're talking about some far-right populists like Javier Milei in Argentina, embattled pols like Israel's Netanyahu, or autocrats like Victor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary and Russia's Vladimir Putin, it's a pretty safe bet to say world leaders are rooting -- praying even -- for a Biden part deux,\" said Sheinkopf.\n\nWith so much at stake -- whether it's climate change or global security -- world leaders can be forgiven for breaking with tradition and making their case to the American people for why the US would be well-advised to give Biden another term.\n\nAlthough many on the American right would likely lambast such pronouncements by foreign leaders and accuse them of \"meddling\" in our elections, those in the middle - in particular, the 6% of voters in six swing states who will actually decide who wins in November - might actually care to know how the rest of the world feels about the choices before them.\n\nSome world leaders have already signaled their aversion to another Trump presidency. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who endured a tough couple of years during the first Trump administration, has been quite vocal about the threat another Trump presidency could have on global climate action.\n\nAnd there is one global leader who isn't at all afraid about speaking his mind: Brazil's Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who came right out and said the quiet part out loud. \"I hope Biden wins the election,\" affirmed the Worker's Party leader in an interview with a Brazilian TV station in February. \"Although I am not a US voter, I think it's obvious that Biden is a greater guarantee for the survival of democracy in the world and the United States.\"\n\nFor American voters who are on the fence about an octogenarian Biden who seems to have lost some pep in his step, or those who have some serious misgivings about America's role in supporting Israel's war in Gaza, perhaps hearing more about the cataclysmic impact a second Trump term would have on hundreds of millions -- even billions -- of people across the globe might mean something.\n\nBut for these foreign leaders, coming out against Trump is a move that is chock full of risks.\n\n\"Trump, if elected, will take Lula's action personally,\" observed Sheinkopf. It's entirely feasible that Trump will then work to end the influence of the BRICS (a bloc of major emerging economies, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) just to get even,\" Sheinkopf added.\n\nGet Our Free Weekly Newsletter\n\nSign up for CNN Opinion's newsletter Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nAccording to one recent Axios report, the advice to foreign leaders from one plugged-in Washington lobbyist was to play it safe: \"Don't put yourself in a position where you can be perceived as being pro-Biden. Because that can be interpreted the wrong way by Team Trump. Likewise, Team Biden could interpret any pro-Trump overtures the same way.\"\n\nBut when the defense of democracy, climate change and perhaps even global security are at risk, playing it safe is no longer a valid option for these world leaders.\n\nWhile it's been a hallmark of our democratic system that Americans of all political stripes should be wary of foreign interests of any kind who seek to influence our elections, this is no ordinary time.\n\nThe next US president will make decisions that will not only affect some 340 million Americans -- but nearly every person on planet earth. Among the critical global issues weighing in the balance this November: how we as a planet address climate action, whether the US decides to preserve decades-old global security alliances, and most importantly, whether the US will continue to be a beacon of light in the promotion and defense of democracy.\n\nThe stakes in this election are too high for global leaders to stay mum. Hopefully more of them speak up about the dangers of a second go-around with Trump.\n\nAnd hopefully some Americans -- particularly in those critical swing states -- will be listening.", "source":

She's also been urging her 20-year-old son's friends to register to vote.\n\nCampaign officials say the encounter is exactly what they are hoping to replicate around the country with a series of small-scale campaign events.\n\nBiden, 81, has spent decades honing his 'retail' politician style of wooing voters. Big, thundering speeches have never been his style but he lights up when meeting people one-on-one, thumping shoulders, hugging strangers and FaceTiming people's moms.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the\n\nmass rallies\n\nhosted by Republican rival Donald Trump -- heavy on stagecraft with classic rock playlists, anti-immigration rhetoric and mostly white audiences -- Biden meets with small, more diverse groups of voters for personal conversations.\n\nThose\n\nsmaller events\n\nare arranged with friendly invitation-only audiences, and often publicized only at the last minute to avoid pro-Palestinian protests that have dogged Biden's appearances for months.\n\nIt's part of a broader campaign strategy that includes celebrity endorsements, a slew of political surrogates, traditional ads and official events to showcase Biden's support for NATO, infrastructure funding and other key policies.\n\nThe campaign is under heavy pressure as Biden wobbles in the polls.\n\nDespite strong economic growth and stock market highs, his approval ratings are near two-year lows, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, and other polls show Trump ahead in several of the battleground states that Biden narrowly won in 2020.\n\nCampaign and Democratic party officials say that is in part because voters are still smarting from higher prices and don't know enough about what Biden has done to reduce costs of prescription drugs and other essentials, or his backing of unions fighting for higher wages.\n\nThey say US media is too \"fractured\" to be an effective way of reaching voters on these issues. So they're enlisting friend networks, super-surrogates, small business groups, podcasts, new media and TikTok stars who they hope will talk issues and policies as they try to convince millions of Americans to back Biden in November.\n\nCharles Franklin, who directs polling at Wisconsin's Marquette University Law School, said that because Biden doesn't have \"groupies\" like Trump, these smaller events are a better bet. \"If they both got the same stadium and did back to back events, [I'm] pretty confident that Trump would have the bigger turnout for that,\" Franklin said.\n\nRepublicans, who ridiculed Biden's 2020 campaign for being run \"from his basement,\" say the lack of big Biden rallies in 2024 is further evidence of his physical and political fragility.\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, described Biden's strategy as \"tiny, staged, 15-minute snooze-fests,\" and said \"Team Trump's campaign events will continue to get bigger and better.\"\n\nBefore events like the one in Racine, the campaign combs its databases for local people who care about a specific issue Biden's policies have addressed or are part of a demographic he hopes to reach, and invites them to meet Biden. Sometimes they find unexpected guests like Dyess.\n\nThe interactions are filmed by the campaign for YouTube video and campaign ads, and followed by local and national media. Ideally, participants make their own social media posts and those go viral, reaching more voters, the campaign says.\n\n\"One of the strategies around any visit is not just to have the perfect room and create the conditions for serendipity, but also to make sure that what happens in the room doesn't stay in the room,\" said Ben Wikler, head of Wisconsin's Democratic Party.\n\nIn Milwaukee in March, for example, Biden met 9-year-old Harry Abramson, who had written to Biden about his stutter.\n\nBiden, who stuttered as a child, shared his strategy for dealing with difficult words. The interaction was picked up by the local Fox affiliate and other TV stations, digital and print media, and Biden's campaign put it on Facebook and other accounts. It went viral, bouncing around chat rooms, TikTok and Reddit.\n\n\"Grandpa's gonna Grandpa. Imagine telling your friends you got speech lessons from the president of the United States,\" one Reddit user wrote under a video of the interaction on \"Made Me Smile,\" a group with 9.5 million members.\n\nBiden visited the Fitts' family home in North Carolina in January, part of a 'kitchen table' visit to regular families in swing states. Afterward, teenaged Christian Fitts posted a video on TikTok showing the President admiring school photos on his refrigerator and sharing french fries at the kitchen table.\n\nThe post got over one million \"likes\" and thousands of comments that attracted millions more views. Many were incredulous, rather than outright endorsements of Biden. \"HIM JUST STANDING AT THE FRIDGE IS SENDING ME\" one user wrote. Nearly 50,000 people liked the comment.\n\nTracking the digital impact of this strategy is difficult, political experts say. New tools to track TikTok content are still not reliable, most Facebook posts are private, and there's no way to know how many of those who comment will actually vote.\n\nTeddy Goff, co-founder of marketing firm Precision Strategies, believes the smaller events are a smart play.\n\n\"They're going to wind up in the local news, local newspaper, local TV, and in all likelihood, will get seen by more people than might have been to that Trump rally,\" said Goff, digital director of former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, referring to an April rally by Trump in Green Bay that drew a crowd of 3,200.\n\nRelying on individuals to share the Biden message can be unpredictable.\n\nSheree Robinson, a Black mother of five from Racine who says funding from Biden's American Rescue Plan helped her earn her a High School Equivalency Diploma, was invited to ride in Biden's limousine during his May Wisconsin visit.\n\nShe posted a video on Facebook showing her smiling next to a bemused-looking Biden, as he gets detailed instructions on what to expect at the next event. In her comment, she used an obscenity to tout herself as a \"big ... deal,\" without any praise of Biden.\n\nLater, however, she called into a local radio program to share what she called an \"awesome\" experience, and plugged Biden's policy that helped her get a degree. The Wisconsin Democratic party is featuring her in digital ads it will use around the state.\n\nSocial media tends to embrace more negative or awkward moments, like a stumble or fall, Goff noted, rather than a tiny event like the recent one in Racine.\n\nBiden's campaign is outspending Trump's on digital media in Wisconsin, according to an analysis by Priorities USA. It spent $2.2 million on digital ads in the state alone since January, compared to $1,500 spent by Trump.\n\nSo far, though, a FiveThirtyEight compilation of Wisconsin polls still shows Trump with a slight lead in the state.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type":

Here's a guide to each 2024 candidate's stance.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nHere's a guide to where President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump stand on Israel -- and why some are threatening to stay home or cast protest votes in November.\n\nIn general, Biden has remained staunchly supportive of Israel as it has waged its war in Gaza -- but over time, he's gradually pushed the country to change its tack in the war.\n\nHis administration has pushed for a six-week cease-fire, conditioned upon Hamas agreeing to release the remaining Israeli hostages.\n\nIn February, he described Israel's conduct in the war as being \"over the top,\" and one month later, he announced the establishment of a temporary port in Gaza while urging Israel to do more to allow the passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nIn March, the US abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire and the release of hostages, allowing it to pass -- though the administration quickly downplayed the significance of that vote.\n\nIn May, his administration halted the shipment of some weapons to Israel amid concerns about the impending invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought refuge. He also threatened to halt further shipments of offensive weapons if a large-scale invasion proceeds, though he has insisted that he will continue to supply the country with defensive weapons.\n\nYet the Biden administration has also cut off US funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the primary source of humanitarian aid in Gaza, over concerns that members of the organization may have been involved in the October 7 attacks.\n\nTrump, the all-but-certain GOP nominee for president in 2024, has been somewhat murky on the present conflict, criticizing Israel numerous times over the optics of the war.\n\n\"I think Israel made a very big mistake,\" he told Israel Hayom in March. \"These photos and shots. I mean, moving shots of bombs being dropped into buildings in Gaza... it's a very bad picture for the world.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump said in that same interview that Israel should \"go and do what you have to do\" and that \"you have to finish up, you have to get the job done.\"\n\nAs president, Trump was even closer with Israel than Biden is, and he took several steps that benefited the Jewish state, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. His administration also recognized the Golan Heights -- a disputed territory claimed by Syria -- as part of Israel.\n\nTrump has also said numerous times that any Jewish person who votes for Biden or other Democrats should \"have their head examined\" -- a missive that many have found offensive, but that signals he would be more staunchly supportive of the country than Biden.\n\nThe former president has also reportedly pledged to deport pro-Palestinian protestors on college campuses.\n\n\"If you get me reelected, we're going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,\" Trump told a group of Jewish donors in May, according to the Washington Post.\n\nGiven that Trump is broadly more supportive of Israel, one might expect voters who are concerned about Israel's war in Gaza to vote for Biden.\n\nThat's especially true given that many of the most vocal opponents of Biden's Israel stance are Arab and Muslim Americans, who have long been a scapegoat for Trump's brand of politics. Trump has also made vague pledges to expand upon the so-called \"Muslim ban\" that he enacted when he was president.\n\nBut many voters aren't doing that.\n\nHundreds of thousands of voters who might otherwise support Biden have cast \"uncommitted\" ballots in Democratic presidential primaries this year in protest of his handling of the conflict.\n\nWhile a solid chunk of those voters are likely to vote for Biden in the general election anyway, many say they're still waiting to see Biden change course.\n\nSome are even saying it's too late -- that Biden has supported what they consider to be a genocide, and that there's no way they can vote for him again.\n\nFor these voters -- some of whom may have even had family members killed in Gaza -- they argue that the war outweighs all other considerations.\n\nAbdullah Hammoud, the mayor of the predominantly-Arab city of Dearborn in Michigan, told Business Insider in March that even though he believes Biden has been a \"transformative\" president in terms of his domestic agenda, some of his constituents will never vote for Biden now.\n\n\"A genocide outweighs all of this,\" said Hammoud. \"Aiding, abetting, defending, and supporting a genocide outweighs all that transformative legislation.\"\n\nRather than cast votes for Biden or Trump, these voters may simply stay home, or cast so-called \"protest\" votes for third-party candidates who have no chance of winning, such as Green Party candidate Jill Stein or independent candidate Cornel West.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

All of these individuals described the high risk involved for public figures to make an endorsement in today's polarized world, explaining that many celebrities might instead align themselves with specific issues rather than a candidate this year.\n\nMore endorsements are expected in the months to come and will kick into high gear between the Democratic National Convention in August and Election Day, multiple sources told CNN. In the meantime, Biden campaign officials are in discussions behind the scenes to prepare for those rollouts, stressing that they carry more influence closer to Election Day.\n\nIn quick succession, this past month, the Biden campaign has announced a June fundraiser with Julia Roberts and George Clooney, as well as an ad narrated by longtime Trump critic Robert De Niro, who participated in a news conference outside the former president's criminal trial on Tuesday - showcasing the star power they've already acquired.\n\nBut political strategists working across the entertainment business express particular concern over Young Hollywood speaking up, which they believe can serve as a pivotal megaphone to help engage Gen Z voters and younger millennials.\n\nThis year, getting younger voters out to the polls is crucial - and they're top of mind for the Biden campaign.\n\n\"You still have a lot of young voters, in particular, who have not yet tuned in to the presidential election. And so that's why this campaign is relentlessly focused on reaching voters where they are right now, not waiting until September or October,\" Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN's Kate Bolduan Wednesday.\n\nBut the Israel-Gaza conflict has emerged as a key issue for the TikTok generation - many of whom are first-time voters this election, and don't agree with the Biden administration's handling of the war in the Middle East.\n\n\"The dream would be to get someone like Zendaya, who is the biggest Gen Z star, or Taylor Swift who covers every rubric for mass appeal,\" a political strategist said, though this individual does not work for the Biden campaign and has no insight into the celebrities the campaign may be targeting.\n\nWith polls showing President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in a tight race ahead of Election Day in November, celebrity endorsements may hold outsize influence to help get voters to the polls this year.\n\n\"It will be the usual suspects\" getting involved in the political process, one celebrity publicist told CNN. \"But four years ago, who were you if you weren't speaking out?\"\n\nThe Biden campaign had long been hoping to roll out more big-name supporters closer to the election, but aides in Wilmington are attempting to take a wider view and are hoping for more than just endorsements, urging celebrities and their teams to think expansively about maximizing their impact on social media followers and beyond.\n\n\"People know who Biden is,\" Adrienne Elrod, a senior advisor and spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN. \"We need to make sure they're delivering our message to their audiences during the most important time of the campaign.\"\n\nHistorically, Hollywood has rallied around Democratic candidates, pushing the entertainment industry's massive influence as elections approach - but this year, there is more trepidation to speak out. In 2008, the Obamas were Hollywood's it-couple, counting Clooney, Jay-Z and Beyonce as close friends. In 2016, celebrities fiercely backed Hillary Clinton in her race against Trump and in 2020, stars staunchly supported Biden to avoid a second Trump term.\n\nAccording to multiple sources consulting celebrities who spoke to CNN, celebrities are weighing whether or when to publicly endorse Biden for the 2024 election amid an increasingly fraught political landscape and as simmering tensions over Israel's ongoing war in Gaza escalate across the country.\n\n\"It's a different world than it was 10 years ago. You can't make anyone happy. You can't win,\" another celebrity publicist told CNN.\n\n\"Celebs feel, more than ever, that the perceived cost is higher,\" a political strategist who advises Hollywood stars added. \"Is it even worth it?\"\n\nTake Mariah Carey for example: Last December, the \"All I Want for Christmas is You\" singer took her two young children for a family visit at the White House, where she hung ornaments in the Oval Office and posed for photos with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nShe intended to spread some holiday cheer. But what she got in return was a scathing comment section, filled with accusations that she was turning a blind eye to the suffering in war-torn Gaza.\n\n\"He is supporting and contributing to a genocide,\" one commenter wrote. \"All I Want For Christmas is for you to open your eyes.\"\n\n\"Disgusting. Another celebrity I'm ready to cross off the list,\" another person commented on Instagram.\n\nCNN has reached out to Carey's team.\n\nAides know the 81-year-old president needs as much help as he can get to appear in touch with popular culture. And while some in Hollywood are eager supporters - Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones hosted a Biden fundraiser in New York last month, Mark Hamill went in for his own Oval Office visit earlier this month - others recognize that aligning themselves with Biden is a risky move in a divisive, social media-driven world.\n\nIn fact, aligning with candidates - at all - this year could prove challenging. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who endorsed Biden in 2020, recently told Fox News that he won't be endorsing any candidate this time around.\n\nAnd rapper Cardi B, who staunchly supported Bernie Sanders in the past and then Biden in the last election, told Rolling Stone in a recent interview that she won't be voting in this election. Over the years, Cardi B has been one of the most influential, politically active celebrities on social media to galvanize her followers to get out to the polls.\n\nBut this year, she told the magazine that neither Trump nor Biden has the best interest of Americans.\n\n\"I don't f -- with both of y'all,\" she bluntly said.\n\nEndorsements still seen as key, even in a tense time\n\nEven before the war erupted in the Middle East, celebrities and their teams had been grappling with when and on which topics to vocalize potentially controversial opinions in an increasingly fraught United States - especially as a large portion of the country has continued to show support for Trump.\n\nIn a show of the power of celebrity, a star-studded Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March raked in a then-record $26 million for Biden's reelection campaign. Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo and Lea Michele performed at the glitzy New York City gathering that brought together Biden with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in conversation with Stephen Colbert. Even then, Israel's war in Gaza loomed large over the evening with protestors inside and outside the venue.\n\nSuch endorsements are part of a strategy to get to voters who may otherwise be hard to reach, according to Alyssa Cass, a Democratic political consultant and partner at Slingshot Strategies, who explained, \"When you're looking for cues on how to vote, someone you watch in the movies or watch playing sports that you like more than either of the two candidates, that's something to go on.\"\n\nCelebrities may be particularly important in an election year where neither candidate is especially popular among voters, Cass said, adding that the timing of their endorsement is also crucial.\n\n\"You want it to be much closer to the election when those infrequent or non-voters or first-time voters are really starting to pay attention,\" she said.\n\nA Democratic strategist said that celebrities are \"really good to capture attention and get earned media and get a crowd to get out the vote,\" adding that some celebrities are privately sharing they're not comfortable endorsing a candidate right now but are expected to come around as Election Day nears.\n\nIn 2020, some high-profile celebrities endorsed Biden closer to Election Day, including Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez - all of whom backed Biden in October of that year.\n\nFor celebrities, the upside in aligning themselves politically is taking advantage of the responsibility and privilege that comes with a massive public platform to rally for issues they believe can improve the country.\n\n\"Celebrities are not going to be saying, 'I'm so passionate about Joe.' But they will, even at a distance, be supporting Biden,\" one of the celebrity advisors who spoke with CNN said. \"Everyone will find their path and will find ways that are helpful ultimately to Joe Biden - but they might just not standing there with Joe Biden.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Hollywood plots political involvement\n\nHigh-powered agents, publicists, managers, and strategists have been participating in regularly scheduled Zoom meetings to discuss organizing and mobilizing voters, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nAnd exclusive fundraisers - without cameras - have shown the extent of Hollywood's support, including one hosted last December by movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, a longtime Democratic supporter who is co-chair of Biden's campaign.\n\nSteven Spielberg, Katzenberg's DreamWorks co-founder, also recently took on a role with the reelection campaign to provide strategy for the Democratic National Convention, according to a source familiar.\n\nDuring a visit to Los Angeles earlier this year, Biden had an intimate, private meeting with heavy hitters in Black Hollywood. The off-the-record and candid conversation centered around the issues that matter most to the Black community, according to a source with knowledge of the gathering.\n\n\"There is the performative celebrity, and then there is the celebrity who does the work behind the scenes,\" a top talent representative said. \"Just because someone isn't posting or hosting an event doesn't mean they're not being active.\"\n\nMany Hollywood reps who spoke to CNN believe the historically engaged Democratic celebrity activists will show up to stump for Biden as the election approaches -- the likes of Eva Longoria, Shonda Rhimes and Connie Britton, who has already sent out a Biden fundraising email.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war creates a Hollywood PR disaster\n\nAs the war in Gaza drags on, the White House's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has made Biden increasingly unpopular among many voters - with 71% of voters disapproving, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nThe war has become especially toxic in Hollywood, showcasing a rare moment of deep divide in an industry that is typically unified on public messaging.\n\nStars like Susan Sarandon, who was fired by her agency for comments she made at a pro-Palestinian rally perceived to be antisemitic, have lost work. And \"Zone of Interest\" director Jonathan Glazer was denounced by over 1,000 Jewish professionals in an open letter, after he said the Holocaust has been \"hijacked by an occupation, which has led to conflict for so many innocent people\" during his Oscars acceptance speech.\n\n\"In Hollywood, there is this real dividing line on Israel and Gaza. Something as simple as which pin you wear on the red carpet - it's like putting on a jersey,\" said Democratic political strategist Jordan C. Brown, who has worked closely with celebrities in advisory roles for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Obama.\n\nThroughout award season, pro-Palestinian stars like Ramy Youssef, Billie Eilish and Mark Ruffalo wore \"Artists4Ceasefire\" pins, while others wore yellow ribbon pins to call for the release of the hostages held in Gaza. Rapper Macklemore released a song earlier this month praising college students who are protesting the war and vowed that he wouldn't vote for Biden in November.\n\nThe Artists4Ceasefire petition launched shortly after Israel's retaliatory strikes began in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack. Hundreds of Hollywood signatories urged Biden to call for a permanent ceasefire, including Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Cynthia Nixon, Drake, Dua Lipa and America Ferrera.\n\nSome pro-Israel, Jewish celebrities have spoken out to raise awareness for the hostages and have made trips to Israel, including actress Debra Messing, Tiffany Haddish, and music executive Scooter Braun. Comedian Michael Rapaport, who has historically been one of Trump's loudest critics, recently said on his Instagram that he now thinks Trump is going to win the election because of \"anti-Jewish screaming on college campuses.\"\n\nBrown said that the division in Hollywood echoes the real-world problems for the Biden administration.\n\n\"For Arab Americans, Biden and Harris are perceived as being totally in the tank of Israel. But for American Jews, it's not enough,\" Brown said.\n\nHollywood expected to rally around key issues, like abortion\n\nMultiple individuals who work at the intersection of celebrity and politics expressed a sense of trepidation across Hollywood to publicly endorse Biden at this stage, but a willingness to engage more on policy - especially on key issues like climate change and abortion.\n\n\"Hollywood will go hard for reproductive health and reproductive freedom. There is no downside,\" Brown said.\n\nSources told CNN they believe that abortion bans across states will drive celebrities to get involved in the election. Sheryl Lee Ralph recently joined Harris for a Pennsylvania campaign event focused on reproductive freedom.\n\n\"They're not going to not engage and let Donald Trump pass a federal restriction on abortion,\" said an A-list adviser who works to pair major stars with cause-based initiatives. \"Republican positions on issues will drive celebrity enthusiasm.\"\n\nAside from abortion, climate change will be a key issue for Hollywood as it has long been a top cause for celebrity environmentalists like Leonardo DiCaprio, who endorsed Biden in the past.\n\n\"Do you want billions and trillions of dollars spent on the environment, or not? You can't make an argument, at all, that Donald Trump has been better on that issue than Biden,\" the advisor sayid.\n\nIn recent months, celebrities have been engaging with the administration on their top issues. Kim Kardashian recently joined Harris at the White House for a roundtable to discuss pardons issued by Biden. Kardashian also visited Trump during his presidency on the same issue.\n\nBack in January, Halle Berry sat down with first lady Dr. Jill Biden to discuss women's health.\n\nBut there may be no galvanizing force more powerful for some in Hollywood than beating Trump.\n\n\"Biden is complicated to support right now for a number of reasons,\" another publicist said. \"But the other option is absolutely not supportable.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She's also been urging her 20-year-old son's friends to register to vote.\n\nCampaign officials say the encounter is exactly what they are hoping to replicate around the country with a series of small-scale campaign events.\n\nBiden, 81, has spent decades honing his 'retail' politician style of wooing voters. Big, thundering speeches have never been his style but he lights up when meeting people one-on-one, thumping shoulders, hugging strangers and FaceTiming people's moms.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the mass rallies hosted by Republican rival Donald Trump -- heavy on stagecraft with classic rock playlists, anti-immigration rhetoric and mostly white audiences -- Biden meets with small, more diverse groups of voters for personal conversations.\n\nThose smaller events are arranged with friendly invitation-only audiences, and often publicized only at the last minute to avoid pro-Palestinian protests that have dogged Biden's appearances for months.\n\nIt's part of a broader campaign strategy that includes celebrity endorsements, a slew of political surrogates, traditional ads and official events to showcase Biden's support for NATO, infrastructure funding and other key policies.\n\nThe campaign is under heavy pressure as Biden wobbles in the polls.\n\nDespite strong economic growth and stock market highs, his approval ratings are near two-year lows, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, and other polls show Trump ahead in several of the battleground states that Biden narrowly won in 2020.\n\nCampaign and Democratic party officials say that is in part because voters are still smarting from higher prices and don't know enough about what Biden has done to reduce costs of prescription drugs and other essentials, or his backing of unions fighting for higher wages.\n\nThey say U.S. media is too \"fractured\" to be an effective way of reaching voters on these issues. So they're enlisting friend networks, super-surrogates, small business groups, podcasts, new media and TikTok stars who they hope will talk issues and policies as they try to convince millions of Americans to back Biden in November.\n\nCharles Franklin, who directs polling at Wisconsin's Marquette University Law School, said that because Biden doesn't have \"groupies\" like Trump, these smaller events are a better bet. \"If they both got the same stadium and did back to back events, [I'm] pretty confident that Trump would have the bigger turnout for that,\" Franklin said.\n\nRepublicans, who ridiculed Biden's 2020 campaign for being run \"from his basement,\" say the lack of big Biden rallies in 2024 is further evidence of his physical and political fragility.\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, described Biden's strategy as \"tiny, staged, 15-minute snooze-fests,\" and said \"Team Trump's campaign events will continue to get bigger and better.\"\n\nBIDEN AT THE FRIDGE Before events like the one in Racine, the campaign combs its databases for local people who care about a specific issue Biden's policies have addressed or are part of a demographic he hopes to reach, and invites them to meet Biden. Sometimes they find unexpected guests like Dyess.\n\nThe interactions are filmed by the campaign for YouTube video and campaign ads, and followed by local and national media. Ideally, participants make their own social media posts and those go viral, reaching more voters, the campaign says.\n\n\"One of the strategies around any visit is not just to have the perfect room and create the conditions for serendipity, but also to make sure that what happens in the room doesn't stay in the room,\" said Ben Wikler, head of Wisconsin's Democratic Party.\n\nIn Milwaukee in March, for example, Biden met 9-year-old Harry Abramson, who had written to Biden about his stutter.\n\nBiden, who stuttered as a child, shared his strategy for dealing with difficult words. The interaction was picked up by the local Fox affiliate and other TV stations, digital and print media, and Biden's campaign put it on Facebook and other accounts. It went viral, bouncing around chat rooms, TikTok and Reddit.\n\n\"Grandpa's gonna Grandpa. Imagine telling your friends you got speech lessons from the president of the United States,\" one Reddit user wrote under a video of the interaction on \"Made Me Smile,\" a group with 9.5 million members.\n\nBiden visited the Fitts' family home in North Carolina in January, part of a 'kitchen table' visit to regular families in swing states. Afterward, teenaged Christian Fitts posted a video on TikTok showing the President admiring school photos on his refrigerator and sharing french fries at the kitchen table.\n\nThe post got over one million \"likes\" and thousands of comments that attracted millions more views. Many were incredulous, rather than outright endorsements of Biden. \"HIM JUST STANDING AT THE FRIDGE IS SENDING ME\" one user wrote. Nearly 50,000 people liked the comment.\n\nNOVEMBER IMPACT IS UNCLEAR\n\nTracking the digital impact of this strategy is difficult, political experts say. New tools to track TikTok content are still not reliable, most Facebook posts are private, and there's no way to know how many of those who comment will actually vote.\n\nTeddy Goff, co-founder of marketing firm Precision Strategies, believes the smaller events are a smart play.\n\n\"They're going to wind up in the local news, local newspaper, local TV, and in all likelihood, will get seen by more people than might have been to that Trump rally,\" said Goff, digital director of former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, referring to an April rally by Trump in Green Bay that drew a crowd of 3,200.\n\nRelying on individuals to share the Biden message can be unpredictable.\n\nSheree Robinson, a Black mother of five from Racine who says funding from Biden's American Rescue Plan helped her earn her a High School Equivalency Diploma, was invited to ride in Biden's limousine during his May Wisconsin visit.\n\nShe posted a video on Facebook showing her smiling next to a bemused-looking Biden, as he gets detailed instructions on what to expect at the next event. In her comment, she used an obscenity to tout herself as a \"big ... deal,\" without any praise of Biden.\n\nLater, however, she called into a local radio program to share what she called an \"awesome\" experience, and plugged Biden's policy that helped her get a degree. The Wisconsin Democratic party is featuring her in digital ads it will use around the state.\n\nSocial media tends to embrace more negative or awkward moments, like a stumble or fall, Goff noted, rather than a tiny event like the recent one in Racine.\n\nBiden's campaign is outspending Trump's on digital media in Wisconsin, according to an analysis by Priorities USA. It spent $2.2 million on digital ads in the state alone since January, compared to $1,500 spent by Trump.\n\nSo far, though, a FiveThirtyEight compilation of Wisconsin polls still shows Trump with a slight lead in the state.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Heather Timmons and Claudia Parsons)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"},

All of these individuals described the high risk involved for public figures to make an endorsement in today's polarized world, explaining that many celebrities might instead align themselves with specific issues rather than a candidate this year.\n\nMore endorsements are expected in the months to come and will kick into high gear between the Democratic National Convention in August and Election Day, multiple sources told CNN. In the meantime, Biden campaign officials are in discussions behind the scenes to prepare for those rollouts, stressing that they carry more influence closer to Election Day.\n\nIn quick succession, this past month, the Biden campaign has announced a June fundraiser with Julia Roberts and George Clooney, as well as an ad narrated by longtime Trump critic Robert De Niro, who participated in a news conference outside the former president's criminal trial on Tuesday - showcasing the star power they've already acquired.\n\nRobert De Niro speaks in support of President Joe Biden outside of Manhattan Criminal Court as former President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump attends his criminal trial for allegedly covering up hush money payments in New York City, on May 28.\n\nCharly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut political strategists working across the entertainment business express particular concern over Young Hollywood speaking up, which they believe can serve as a pivotal megaphone to help engage Gen Z voters and younger millennials.\n\nThis year, getting younger voters out to the polls is crucial - and they're top of mind for the Biden campaign.\n\n\"You still have a lot of young voters, in particular, who have not yet tuned in to the presidential election. And so that's why this campaign is relentlessly focused on reaching voters where they are right now, not waiting until September or October,\" Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told CNN's Kate Bolduan Wednesday.\n\nBut the Israel-Gaza conflict has emerged as a key issue for the TikTok generation - many of whom are first-time voters this election, and don't agree with the Biden administration's handling of the war in the Middle East.\n\n\"The dream would be to get someone like Zendaya, who is the biggest Gen Z star, or Taylor Swift who covers every rubric for mass appeal,\" a political strategist said, though this individual does not work for the Biden campaign and has no insight into the celebrities the campaign may be targeting.\n\nWith polls showing President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump in a tight race ahead of Election Day in November, celebrity endorsements may hold outsize influence to help get voters to the polls this year.\n\n\"It will be the usual suspects\" getting involved in the political process, one celebrity publicist told CNN. \"But four years ago, who were you if you weren't speaking out?\"\n\nThe Biden campaign had long been hoping to roll out more big-name supporters closer to the election, but aides in Wilmington are attempting to take a wider view and are hoping for more than just endorsements, urging celebrities and their teams to think expansively about maximizing their impact on social media followers and beyond.\n\n\"People know who Biden is,\" Adrienne Elrod, a senior advisor and spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN. \"We need to make sure they're delivering our message to their audiences during the most important time of the campaign.\"\n\nHistorically, Hollywood has rallied around Democratic candidates, pushing the entertainment industry's massive influence as elections approach - but this year, there is more trepidation to speak out. In 2008, the Obamas were Hollywood's it-couple, counting Clooney, Jay-Z and Beyonce as close friends. In 2016, celebrities fiercely backed Hillary Clinton in her race against Trump and in 2020, stars staunchly supported Biden to avoid a second Trump term.\n\nPresident Barack Obama dances with his wife and First Lady Michelle Obama as Beyonce sings \"At Last\" during the first Inaugural Ball on January 20, 2009 in Washington, DC.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nAccording to multiple sources consulting celebrities who spoke to CNN, celebrities are weighing whether or when to publicly endorse Biden for the 2024 election amid an increasingly fraught political landscape and as simmering tensions over Israel's ongoing war in Gaza escalate across the country.\n\n\"It's a different world than it was 10 years ago. You can't make anyone happy. You can't win,\" another celebrity publicist told CNN.\n\n\"Celebs feel, more than ever, that the perceived cost is higher,\" a political strategist who advises Hollywood stars added. \"Is it even worth it?\"\n\nTake Mariah Carey for example: Last December, the \"All I Want for Christmas is You\" singer took her two young children for a family visit at the White House, where she hung ornaments in the Oval Office and posed for photos with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nShe intended to spread some holiday cheer. But what she got in return was a scathing comment section, filled with accusations that she was turning a blind eye to the suffering in war-torn Gaza.\n\n\"He is supporting and contributing to a genocide,\" one commenter wrote. \"All I Want For Christmas is for you to open your eyes.\"\n\n\"Disgusting. Another celebrity I'm ready to cross off the list,\" another person commented on Instagram.\n\nCNN has reached out to Carey's team.\n\nAides know the 81-year-old president needs as much help as he can get to appear in touch with popular culture. And while some in Hollywood are eager supporters - Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones hosted a Biden fundraiser in New York last month, Mark Hamill went in for his own Oval Office visit earlier this month - others recognize that aligning themselves with Biden is a risky move in a divisive, social media-driven world.\n\nIn fact, aligning with candidates - at all - this year could prove challenging. Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, who endorsed Biden in 2020, recently told Fox News that he won't be endorsing any candidate this time around.\n\nAnd rapper Cardi B, who staunchly supported Bernie Sanders in the past and then Biden in the last election, told Rolling Stone in a recent interview that she won't be voting in this election. Over the years, Cardi B has been one of the most influential, politically active celebrities on social media to galvanize her followers to get out to the polls.\n\nBut this year, she told the magazine that neither Trump nor Biden has the best interest of Americans.\n\n\"I don't f -- with both of y'all,\" she bluntly said.\n\nEndorsements still seen as key, even in a tense time\n\nEven before the war erupted in the Middle East, celebrities and their teams had been grappling with when and on which topics to vocalize potentially controversial opinions in an increasingly fraught United States - especially as a large portion of the country has continued to show support for Trump.\n\nIn a show of the power of celebrity, a star-studded Radio City Music Hall fundraiser in March raked in a then-record $26 million for Biden's reelection campaign. Queen Latifah, Lizzo, Ben Platt, Cynthia Erivo and Lea Michele performed at the glitzy New York City gathering that brought together Biden with former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton in conversation with Stephen Colbert. Even then, Israel's war in Gaza loomed large over the evening with protestors inside and outside the venue.\n\nundefined --\n\nPresident Joe Biden, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton participate in a discussion moderated by Stephen Colbert, host of CBS's \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\", during a campaign fundraising event at Radio City Music Hall in New York on March 28.\n\nElizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nSuch endorsements are part of a strategy to get to voters who may otherwise be hard to reach, according to Alyssa Cass, a Democratic political consultant and partner at Slingshot Strategies, who explained, \"When you're looking for cues on how to vote, someone you watch in the movies or watch playing sports that you like more than either of the two candidates, that's something to go on.\"\n\nCelebrities may be particularly important in an election year where neither candidate is especially popular among voters, Cass said, adding that the timing of their endorsement is also crucial.\n\n\"You want it to be much closer to the election when those infrequent or non-voters or first-time voters are really starting to pay attention,\" she said.\n\nA Democratic strategist said that celebrities are \"really good to capture attention and get earned media and get a crowd to get out the vote,\" adding that some celebrities are privately sharing they're not comfortable endorsing a candidate right now but are expected to come around as Election Day nears.\n\nIn 2020, some high-profile celebrities endorsed Biden closer to Election Day, including Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez - all of whom backed Biden in October of that year.\n\nFor celebrities, the upside in aligning themselves politically is taking advantage of the responsibility and privilege that comes with a massive public platform to rally for issues they believe can improve the country.\n\n\"Celebrities are not going to be saying, 'I'm so passionate about Joe.' But they will, even at a distance, be supporting Biden,\" one of the celebrity advisors who spoke with CNN said. \"Everyone will find their path and will find ways that are helpful ultimately to Joe Biden - but they might just not standing there with Joe Biden.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Hollywood plots political involvement\n\nHigh-powered agents, publicists, managers, and strategists have been participating in regularly scheduled Zoom meetings to discuss organizing and mobilizing voters, multiple sources told CNN.\n\nAnd exclusive fundraisers - without cameras - have shown the extent of Hollywood's support, including one hosted last December by movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, a longtime Democratic supporter who is co-chair of Biden's campaign.\n\nSteven Spielberg, Katzenberg's DreamWorks co-founder, also recently took on a role with the reelection campaign to provide strategy for the Democratic National Convention, according to a source familiar.\n\nDuring a visit to Los Angeles earlier this year, Biden had an intimate, private meeting with heavy hitters in Black Hollywood. The off-the-record and candid conversation centered around the issues that matter most to the Black community, according to a source with knowledge of the gathering.\n\n\"There is the performative celebrity, and then there is the celebrity who does the work behind the scenes,\" a top talent representative said. \"Just because someone isn't posting or hosting an event doesn't mean they're not being active.\"\n\nMany Hollywood reps who spoke to CNN believe the historically engaged Democratic celebrity activists will show up to stump for Biden as the election approaches -- the likes of Eva Longoria, Shonda Rhimes and Connie Britton, who has already sent out a Biden fundraising email.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war creates a Hollywood PR disaster\n\nAs the war in Gaza drags on, the White House's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has made Biden increasingly unpopular among many voters - with 71% of voters disapproving, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS.\n\nThe war has become especially toxic in Hollywood, showcasing a rare moment of deep divide in an industry that is typically unified on public messaging.\n\nStars like Susan Sarandon, who was fired by her agency for comments she made at a pro-Palestinian rally perceived to be antisemitic, have lost work. And \"Zone of Interest\" director Jonathan Glazer was denounced by over 1,000 Jewish professionals in an open letter, after he said the Holocaust has been \"hijacked by an occupation, which has led to conflict for so many innocent people\" during his Oscars acceptance speech.\n\n\"In Hollywood, there is this real dividing line on Israel and Gaza. Something as simple as which pin you wear on the red carpet - it's like putting on a jersey,\" said Democratic political strategist Jordan C. Brown, who has worked closely with celebrities in advisory roles for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Obama.\n\nThroughout award season, pro-Palestinian stars like Ramy Youssef, Billie Eilish and Mark Ruffalo wore \"Artists4Ceasefire\" pins, while others wore yellow ribbon pins to call for the release of the hostages held in Gaza. Rapper Macklemore released a song earlier this month praising college students who are protesting the war and vowed that he wouldn't vote for Biden in November.\n\nBillie Eilish at the 96th Annual Oscars in March in Los Angeles.\n\nAlberto Rodriguez/Variety/Getty Images\n\nThe Artists4Ceasefire petition launched shortly after Israel's retaliatory strikes began in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 attack. Hundreds of Hollywood signatories urged Biden to call for a permanent ceasefire, including Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Cynthia Nixon, Drake, Dua Lipa and America Ferrera.\n\nSome pro-Israel, Jewish celebrities have spoken out to raise awareness for the hostages and have made trips to Israel, including actress Debra Messing, Tiffany Haddish, and music executive Scooter Braun. Comedian Michael Rapaport, who has historically been one of Trump's loudest critics, recently said on his Instagram that he now thinks Trump is going to win the election because of \"anti-Jewish screaming on college campuses.\"\n\nBrown said that the division in Hollywood echoes the real-world problems for the Biden administration.\n\n\"For Arab Americans, Biden and Harris are perceived as being totally in the tank of Israel. But for American Jews, it's not enough,\" Brown said.\n\nHollywood expected to rally around key issues, like abortion\n\nMultiple individuals who work at the intersection of celebrity and politics expressed a sense of trepidation across Hollywood to publicly endorse Biden at this stage, but a willingness to engage more on policy - especially on key issues like climate change and abortion.\n\n\"Hollywood will go hard for reproductive health and reproductive freedom. There is no downside,\" Brown said.\n\nSources told CNN they believe that abortion bans across states will drive celebrities to get involved in the election. Sheryl Lee Ralph recently joined Harris for a Pennsylvania campaign event focused on reproductive freedom.\n\n\"They're not going to not engage and let Donald Trump pass a federal restriction on abortion,\" said an A-list adviser who works to pair major stars with cause-based initiatives. \"Republican positions on issues will drive celebrity enthusiasm.\"\n\nAside from abortion, climate change will be a key issue for Hollywood as it has long been a top cause for celebrity environmentalists like Leonardo DiCaprio, who endorsed Biden in the past.\n\n\"Do you want billions and trillions of dollars spent on the environment, or not? You can't make an argument, at all, that Donald Trump has been better on that issue than Biden,\" the advisor sayid.\n\nIn recent months, celebrities have been engaging with the administration on their top issues. Kim Kardashian recently joined Harris at the White House for a roundtable to discuss pardons issued by Biden. Kardashian also visited Trump during his presidency on the same issue.\n\nReality-television star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian attends an event to discuss criminal justice reform with Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 25.\n\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBack in January, Halle Berry sat down with first lady Dr. Jill Biden to discuss women's health.\n\nBut there may be no galvanizing force more powerful for some in Hollywood than beating Trump.\n\n\"Biden is complicated to support right now for a number of reasons,\" another publicist said. \"But the other option is absolutely not supportable.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "priscilla_alvarez@cnn.com", "name": "Priscilla

Biden engages personally, hoping to mobilize support through grassroots interactions and digital amplification. Despite higher campaign spending, polls show Biden trailing Trump in key battleground states like Wisconsin.\n\nAndrea Dyess, 57, was already a Joe Biden fan, but after meeting him in her neighborhood of Racine, Wisconsin, in May, she has been talking to anyone who will listen about giving him four more years in the White House.\n\nDyess was on a street corner with her two young grandchildren trying to catch a glimpse of Biden's motorcade, when a campaign worker invited her to join the president at a nearby community center. Biden listened attentively as she told him about surviving cancer and how the Affordable Care Act, which Biden helped push as Barack Obama's vice president, saved her life.\n\n\"I told him, just keep fighting the fight,\" she said, Since then, Dyess says she has shared her \"once in a lifetime moment\" directly with dozens of friends and relatives, at a church revival, at her grandkids' school and on her neighborhood walks. She's also been urging her 20-year-old son's friends to register to vote.\n\nCampaign officials say the encounter is exactly what they are hoping to replicate around the country with a series of small-scale campaign events. Biden, 81, has spent decades honing his 'retail' politician style of wooing voters. Big, thundering speeches have never been his style but he lights up when meeting people one-on-one, thumping shoulders, hugging strangers and FaceTiming people's moms.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the mass rallies\n\nhosted by Republican rival Donald Trump -- heavy on stagecraft with classic rock playlists, anti-immigration rhetoric and mostly white audiences -- Biden meets with small, more diverse groups of voters for personal conversations. Those\n\nsmaller events are arranged with friendly invitation-only audiences, and often publicized only at the last minute to avoid pro-Palestinian protests that have dogged Biden's appearances for months.\n\nIt's part of a broader campaign strategy that includes celebrity endorsements, a slew of political surrogates, traditional ads and official events to showcase Biden's support for NATO, infrastructure funding and other key policies. The campaign is under heavy pressure as Biden wobbles in the polls.\n\nDespite strong economic growth and stock market highs, his approval ratings are near two-year lows, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed, and other polls show Trump ahead in several of the battleground states that Biden narrowly won in 2020. Campaign and Democratic party officials say that is in part because voters are still smarting from higher prices and don't know enough about what Biden has done to reduce costs of prescription drugs and other essentials, or his backing of unions fighting for higher wages.\n\nThey say U.S. media is too \"fractured\" to be an effective way of reaching voters on these issues. So they're enlisting friend networks, super-surrogates, small business groups, podcasts, new media and TikTok stars who they hope will talk issues and policies as they try to convince millions of Americans to back Biden in November. Charles Franklin, who directs polling at Wisconsin's Marquette University Law School, said that because Biden doesn't have \"groupies\" like Trump, these smaller events are a better bet. \"If they both got the same stadium and did back to back events, [I'm] pretty confident that Trump would have the bigger turnout for that,\" Franklin said.\n\nRepublicans, who ridiculed Biden's 2020 campaign for being run \"from his basement,\" say the lack of big Biden rallies in 2024 is further evidence of his physical and political fragility. Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, described Biden's strategy as \"tiny, staged, 15-minute snooze-fests,\" and said \"Team Trump's campaign events will continue to get bigger and better.\"\n\nBIDEN AT THE FRIDGE Before events like the one in Racine, the campaign combs its databases for local people who care about a specific issue Biden's policies have addressed or are part of a demographic he hopes to reach, and invites them to meet Biden. Sometimes they find unexpected guests like Dyess.\n\nThe interactions are filmed by the campaign for YouTube video and campaign ads, and followed by local and national media. Ideally, participants make their own social media posts and those go viral, reaching more voters, the campaign says. \"One of the strategies around any visit is not just to have the perfect room and create the conditions for serendipity, but also to make sure that what happens in the room doesn't stay in the room,\" said Ben Wikler, head of Wisconsin's Democratic Party.\n\nIn Milwaukee in March, for example, Biden met 9-year-old Harry Abramson, who had written to Biden about his stutter. Biden, who stuttered as a child, shared his strategy for dealing with difficult words. The interaction was picked up by the local Fox affiliate and other TV stations, digital and print media, and Biden's campaign put it on Facebook and other accounts. It went viral, bouncing around chat rooms, TikTok and Reddit.\n\n\"Grandpa's gonna Grandpa. Imagine telling your friends you got speech lessons from the president of the United States,\" one Reddit user wrote under a video of the interaction on \"Made Me Smile,\" a group with 9.5 million members. Biden visited the Fitts' family home in North Carolina in January, part of a 'kitchen table' visit to regular families in swing states. Afterward, teenaged Christian Fitts posted a video on TikTok showing the President admiring school photos on his refrigerator and sharing french fries at the kitchen table.\n\nThe post got over one million \"likes\" and thousands of comments that attracted millions more views. Many were incredulous, rather than outright endorsements of Biden. \"HIM JUST STANDING AT THE FRIDGE IS SENDING ME\" one user wrote. Nearly 50,000 people liked the comment. NOVEMBER IMPACT IS UNCLEAR\n\nTracking the digital impact of this strategy is difficult, political experts say. New tools to track TikTok content are still not reliable, most Facebook posts are private, and there's no way to know how many of those who comment will actually vote. Teddy Goff, co-founder of marketing firm Precision Strategies, believes the smaller events are a smart play.\n\n\"They're going to wind up in the local news, local newspaper, local TV, and in all likelihood, will get seen by more people than might have been to that Trump rally,\" said Goff, digital director of former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, referring to an April rally by Trump in Green Bay that drew a crowd of 3,200. Relying on individuals to share the Biden message can be unpredictable.\n\nSheree Robinson, a Black mother of five from Racine who says funding from Biden's American Rescue Plan helped her earn her a High School Equivalency Diploma, was invited to ride in Biden's limousine during his May Wisconsin visit. She posted a video on Facebook showing her smiling next to a bemused-looking Biden, as he gets detailed instructions on what to expect at the next event. In her comment, she used an obscenity to tout herself as a \"big ... deal,\" without any praise of Biden.\n\nLater, however, she called into a local radio program to share what she called an \"awesome\" experience, and plugged Biden's policy that helped her get a degree. The Wisconsin Democratic party is featuring her in digital ads it will use around the state. Social media tends to embrace more negative or awkward moments, like a stumble or fall, Goff noted, rather than a tiny event like the recent one in Racine.\n\nBiden's campaign is outspending Trump's on digital media in Wisconsin, according to an analysis by Priorities USA. It spent $2.2 million on digital ads in the state alone since January, compared to $1,500 spent by Trump. So far, though, a FiveThirtyEight compilation of Wisconsin polls still shows Trump with a slight lead in the state.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from

He's counting on America to roll with him | Kelly", "body": "Donald Trump's first criminal trial is coming to a close. These are the verdict outcomes the jury could reach in the New York hush money trial.\n\nIn the first months of Donald Trump's presidency, long before his much-ballyhooed promises to revamp health care, fix immigration and jump-start a massive infrastructure program had fizzled, I sat down with one of his most loyal Republican supporters.\n\nBetsy Hower of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, was no fool. Yes, she was a rock-solid Republican -- a former party chairwoman of Adams County, Pennsylvania. And yes, she felt Trump could transform America and even had the personal charisma to \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nBut she also knew Trump's personal flaws.\n\n\"He's no choirboy,\" she said with all the matter-of-fact assuredness that she also used to describe the rolling beauty of the countryside near her town. \"I know that.\"\n\nIn that simple admission by just one Trump loyalist, you can find the roots of a recurring national dilemma that America once again faces as Trump's hush money trial concludes in New York City.\n\nWe all know Trump's flaws. But do those flaws matter anymore?\n\nYes, he's bombastic and a showman. He makes promises he can't always keep. He breaks rules -- and brags about it. What we learned during the nearly two months of testimony at Trump's trial in lower Manhattan was hardly a shock to anyone who has followed him. He has a long record of bending truth and morals. As he said in the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" recording about how he handles women, \"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\"\n\nAnd so, as Hower told me in the spring of 2017, no one should be shocked by Trump's behavior. America knows that Trump will never be canonized as a saint. And yet, nearly half of American voters say they admire him enough to vote for him again as their president. Indeed, Trump may win the White House again.\n\nSuch is the political reality that has made this election year so historic -- and so difficult to predict or even understand.\n\nWhat have we learned from Trump's hush money trial?\n\nAdded now to this perplexing mix are the stream of tawdry revelations from Trump's trial in New York City.\n\nIn the course of testimony, America learned that its former (and possibly future) president met with the publisher of a supermarket tabloid that traffics in falsehoods. The goal of the meeting was to discuss ways to not only \"catch and kill\" negative stories about Trump but to promote negative stories about his political rivals, even if they were not true.\n\nAmerica also learned the nitty-gritty of an alleged extramarital tryst between its president and a porn actress -- with such details that included Trump changing from silk pajamas into his boxers and a T-shirt and laying on a bed. And, as if that wasn't enough, we learned of plans to pay this porn actress to keep her mouth shut about the meeting.\n\nYou don't need to be a presidential historian to conclude that many other candidates would have either been banished from politics entirely or left helpless as their support among voters vanished if even one chapter of the narrative from Trump's New York City trial were somehow tied to them.\n\nDoes anyone remember Gary Hart? Once upon a time, he was considered a front-runner for the White House. Then came that ride on a boat named \"Monkey Business\" and a photograph of him with an extremely attractive blonde who was not his wife. Hart quickly went from top candidate to historical footnote.\n\nHart's business with \"Monkey Business\" seems almost small and inconsequential when compared to Trump's history. Indeed, perhaps the most astonishing characteristic of Trump's political life is that he continues to thrive as a much-admired public figure despite the torrent of bad news, trip-ups, poor judgments and occasional craziness.\n\nRemember Trump's put-down of the Vietnam war hero, Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican? Or, before that, his racist and false claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and therefore should not be president? Or Trump's promise to ban Muslim immigrants? Or his suggestion during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that health officials should study the possibility of injecting bleach into the human body to fight the virus? Or his false claims about the outcome of the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Joe Biden? Or his support for the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as a last-ditch effort by his supporters to keep him in power?\n\nEach of these incidents -- and plenty of others -- would have likely destroyed the political careers of other candidates. Not Trump, however. So perhaps the most accurate prediction that anyone can make in the wake of the so-called hush money, porn-star criminal trial in New York City is that Trump's popularity will not fade.\n\nWhich brings us back to the reality check that Betsy Hower mentioned in the spring of 2017 -- that Trump is \"no choirboy\" and \"we know that.\"\n\nMore Mike Kelly: Can Americans trust a verdict in Donald Trump's hush-money case? Will they?\n\nMike Kelly exclusive: Trump talks federal indictment, court hearing and the 2024 election\n\nWhat would Trump say or do in a new term as president?\n\nYes, America knows exactly what it's getting with Trump. He's definitely not shy about telling us about himself.\n\nIf elected, he promises to deport undocumented migrants - an estimated 11 million people. He also promises to set up \"migrant camps\" to control new immigrants who crossed the southern border without proper certification. And if push comes to shove, he further promises to assign U.S. military units to patrol the southern border to stop what he calls an \"invasion\" of migrants.\n\nTrump has further said that he is open to punishing women who have abortions. He said he would gut the federal civil service system, eliminating or throwing into complete chaos the status of tens of thousands of government staffers. Does this include technicians who monitor nuclear waste? Or scientists who make sure our drinking water is clean? Trump doesn't say. Does he even understand the implications of such a decision?\n\nHe would \"encourage\" Russia to attack any NATO nation that fails to pay its bills to the Western alliance, which is generally credited with keeping the peace in Europe for nearly eight decades.\n\nHe would impose an import tax or tariff of 10% on imported goods.\n\nHe would pardon the more than 800 people who were convicted of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. And, as an added measure, he would appoint a special federal prosecutor to \"go after the most corrupt president in the history of America, Joe Biden, and go after the Biden crime family.\"\n\nIncidentally, Trump made that promise to \"go after\" Biden after returning to his golf course and home in Bedminster, New Jersey, last June, only hours after being arraigned at a federal courthouse in Miami on charges that he illegally kept top secret documents after leaving the White House.\n\nWatching Trump that night, I was struck by the man's willingness to punch back in the face of what seemed at the time to be one of the most devastating criminal indictments -- that he tried to essentially steal classified documents from his own country. Some of those documents included highly classified \"war plans.\" Spies behave like that, not presidents.\n\nBut that's how Trump operates. His behavior on many occasions calls into question is basic character.\n\nWalking out of the courtroom one day this week at his trial in New York City, Trump stepped before the cameras in the hallway and repeated what has become something of a mantra of grievance for him. The trial was a \"witch hunt,\" he said -- again. He added that \"it should have never happened\" and that it was a \"very unfair trial.\"\n\nAnd then, he pledged that \"we're going to bring back our nation.\" Whatever that means.\n\nFor Donald Trump, the trial and its revelations seemed like just another annoyance -- a political pothole to be rolled over.\n\nHe's counting on America to just keep rolling with him.", "source": {"uri":

Kennedy Jr. files complaint about being left out of CNN presidential debate - Poynter", "body": "He alleges that Biden and Trump are colluding to exclude him from the June 27 debate -- and that CNN is in on it. His argument is quite the stretch.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is all riled up that he's not being included in the upcoming presidential debate on CNN, and now his camp is filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nHis grievance is pretty straightforward: He is alleging that President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are colluding to exclude him from the debate set for June 27 -- and he's claiming that CNN is in on it, too.\n\nKennedy's lawyer, Lorenzo Holloway, wrote in a letter to the FEC, \"CNN is making prohibited corporate contributions to both campaigns and the Biden committee and the Trump committee have accepted these prohibited corporate contributions.\"\n\nThat's quite the accusation, and quite the stretch -- to suggest having Biden and Trump in a debate without Kennedy is essentially a political contribution.\n\nAs far as debate qualifications, CNN said in a statement, \"The law in virtually every state provides that the nominee of a state-recognized political party will be allowed ballot access without petitioning. As the presumptive nominees of their parties both Biden and Trump will satisfy this requirement. As an independent candidate, under applicable laws RFK, Jr. does not. The mere application for ballot access does not guarantee that he will appear on the ballot in any state. In addition, RFK, Jr. does not currently meet our polling criteria, which, like the other objective criteria, were set before issuing invitations to the debate.\"\n\nThis mess started when Biden and Trump decided to ignore the traditional bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and deal directly with one another and the TV networks. Biden's camp seemed only interested in debating Trump one-on-one and deals were struck for Biden and Trump to debate twice: on CNN on June 27 and on ABC in September.\n\nThe Washington Post's Amy B Wang and Meryl Kornfield wrote, \"Polls have shown Kennedy would not have qualified to appear on the debate stage if Biden and Trump had agreed to meetings organized by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. However, the networks' proposed rules opened a path for Kennedy. To qualify for the CNN debate, candidates must by June 20 appear on enough state ballots that would give them a path to reach 270 electoral votes, as well as receive at least 15 percent in four national polls that meet the network's standards. The ABC debate has similar qualification requirements.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the eligibility window hasn't closed and therefore Kennedy, or anyone else who meets the eligibility requirements, could still qualify.\n\nHowever, the Post wrote, \"Kennedy's campaign has acquired the signatures or expects to soon for states that would add up to 270 electoral votes, but is not sure if states will certify the results in time, according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The campaign is also aware that their early submission of signatures could give Democrats and others the opening to file objections in states where it is seeking ballot access.\"\n\nLet's be real. Biden doesn't want Kennedy there, and neither does Trump. Kennedy certainly could play spoiler in the upcoming election, but oddly, it's still not totally clear whose chances he might spoil. Therefore, both Biden and Trump would just as well see Kennedy left out.\n\nBut it's difficult to believe CNN would be in cahoots with Biden and Trump.\n\nBottom line, it would be surprising to see Kennedy on the debate stage on June 27.\n\nUri Berliner is speaking up.\n\nBerliner was a veteran business editor at NPR who went viral in April after writing a piece heavily criticizing NPR for losing America's trust with coverage that he called biased toward the left. Berliner, who wrote the piece for conservative Bari Weiss' media company, was suspended without pay for five days, and ended up resigning from NPR.\n\nIn his first interview since then, Berliner told The Times of London's Josie Ensor, \"I knew it would raise questions within NPR, but I had no idea it would become such a major national story.\"\n\nEnsor's story said Berliner said he has heard from hundreds of current and former listeners in the past few weeks who felt NPR's coverage had become \"predictably progressive\" and \"not as interesting as it used to be.\" Berliner said, \"These are people all over the political map. They have lost large numbers of conservatives, moderates and, judging by the correspondence I've received, many traditional liberals as well.\"\n\nNPR has its defenders, as well, and there were some serious issues with Berliner's original piece, which was criticized by many for not providing context, adding other details and not including reaction from those inside NPR.\n\nMuch of the Times story goes over already covered ground, so the one thing that ended up standing out was Berliner saying he was surprised his essay became a major story.\n\nSomeone who works at a well-known media outlet accuses that media outlet of having a liberal bias and he's surprised it became a \"major national story?\"\n\nThat is the surprising part.\n\nEnsor wrote, \"The veteran journalist said he was taking a break and re-calibrating. At his age he could be forgiven for considering retirement, but that is not the plan. He is lining up new work -- though he declines to offer specifics -- and is considering a move to New York, home to his beloved basketball team, the Knicks.\"\n\nJodi Kantor is The New York Times reporter who broke the big story a couple of weeks ago of an upside-down American flag flying outside the Alexandria, Virginia, home of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito in the days following the Jan. 6 insurrection and days before Joe Biden was inaugurated as president. The upside-down flag was a symbol that many supporters of Donald Trump used to falsely claim the election was stolen from Trump. Such flags were seen at the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nAlito told the Times that he had nothing to do with the flag. He told the Times, \"It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.\"\n\nThe Times followed that up with another story about an \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag that flew outside Alito's vacation home in New Jersey just last summer. The Times wrote that the flag is \"now a symbol of support for former President Donald J. Trump, for a religious strand of the 'Stop the Steal' campaign and for a push to remake the American government in Christian terms.\"\n\nNow, Kantor has a new story about the neighborhood dispute that supposedly led Alito's wife, Martha-Ann Alito, to fly the upside-down flag.\n\nAs all this plays out, there have been calls from Democratic lawmakers for Alito to recuse himself from cases involving Jan. 6.\n\nWell, Alito wrote letters to Democrats in Congress and his message was clear: He has no intention of recusing himself.\n\nAlito wrote, \"My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not. She was solely responsible for having flagpoles put up at our residence and our vacation home and has flown a wide variety of flags over the years.\"\n\nHe wrote about the initial incident at the Virginia home in January 2021, saying, \"I had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of the flag. I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention. As soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused.\"\n\nHe added, \"My wife and I own our Virginia home jointly. She therefore has the legal right to use the property as she sees fit, and there were no additional steps that I could have taken to have the flag taken down more promptly.\"\n\nAlito acknowledges that the upside-down flag is meant to support the \"Stop the Steal\" movement, but said the \"Appeal to Heaven\" flag was not meant to associate with any cause or movement involving Trump and the election.\n\nAlito added, \"As I said in reference to the other flag event, my wife is an independently minded private citizen. She makes her own decisions, and I honor her right to do so.\"\n\nAs far as recusing himself from Jan. 6 cases, Alito wrote, \"A reasonable person who is not motivated by political or ideological considerations or a desire to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude this event does not meet the applicable standard for recusal.\"\n\nAdd The Atlantic and Vox to the media companies that have signed deals with OpenAI. They signed separate agreements announced Wednesday.\n\nAxios' Sara Fischer reports, \"Both agreements also allow OpenAI to tap into the respective publishers' current content to fuel responses to user queries in OpenAI products, including ChatGPT. OpenAI will include citations to their work when it's referenced in a response to a user query and will link out to the relevant article.\"\n\nTerms were not announced, but one would assume that The Atlantic and Vox are being compensated.\n\nI wrote this a week ago, right after the Murdoch family's News Corp., which publishes The Wall Street Journal and New York Post, signed a deal with OpenAI: \"Some media companies, such as The New York Times and several outlets owned by Alden Global Capital, have lodged lawsuits against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement. Meanwhile, other media companies, including The Associated Press, have reached limited partnership deals with OpenAI. And then there is The Washington Post, which has not struck a deal yet, but is in the market for AI partnerships.\"\n\nFischer wrote for Axios, \"More major news companies are opting to strike deals with OpenAI rather than pursue litigation, for different reasons. In some cases, the deals themselves may end up delivering as much or more cash than a lawsuit settlement -- a lot quicker. The deals also help publishers eager to put AI to work in their businesses.\"\n\nIn a statement, The Atlantic's CEO Nicholas Thompson said, \"We believe that people searching with AI models will be one of the fundamental ways that people navigate the web in the future.\"\n\nAnd Jim Bankoff, co-founder, chair and CEO of Vox Media, said in a statement, \"We're thrilled to partner with OpenAI. This agreement aligns with our goals of leveraging generative AI to innovate for our audiences and customers, protect and grow the value of our work and intellectual property, and boost productivity and discoverability to elevate the talent and creativity of our exceptional journalists and creators.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is optimistic about these developments. The Vox Media Union put out a statement saying they were not informed of the deal until it was announced and that, as \"journalists and workers,\" they had \"serious concerns\" about the partnership with OpenAI. They added, \"... which we believe could adversely impact members of our union, not to mention the well-documented ethical and environmental concerns surrounding the use of generative AI.\"\n\nAlex McCaskill used to work for Fox News. He was once a producer on Tucker Carlson's show. In June 2023, after Carlson had been fired, McCaskill was still at Fox News and responsible for an on-screen chyron that called President Joe Biden a \"wannabe dictator.\" At the time, Fox News put out a statement that said, \"The chyron was taken down immediately and was addressed.\"\n\nWithin days, McCaskill left the network. Carlson said in a video on X, \"First they scolded the producer who put the banner on the screen. Less than 24 hours after that, he resigned. He had been at Fox for more than a decade. He was considered one of the most capable people in the building. He offered to stay for the customary two weeks, but Fox told him to clear out his desk and leave immediately.\"\n\nBut now McCaskill is apparently back on cable news. The Daily Beast's Justin Baragona reports that McCaskill is working at NewsNation. Baragona wrote that sources told him that McCaskill is a producer on the prime-time hour hosted by Dan Abrams.\n\nNewsNation did not respond to Baragona's request for comment. I reached out to a NewsNation spokesperson on Wednesday and did not hear back.\n\nBaragona wrote, \"The hiring of McCaskill, who was also named in an explosive lawsuit last year accusing him of workplace harassment and retaliation, seems to run counter to the 'centrist' image that both NewsNation and Abrams are trying to sell.\"\n\nHave feedback or a tip?

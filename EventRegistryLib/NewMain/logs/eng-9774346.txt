A co-chair of the event, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, announced she would step down.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah said in a post on X. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nThe reaction from NABJ members underscored the divisiveness of the former president as both he and the likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, seek the support of Black voters with less than 100 days until the November election.\n\nThe NABJ announced Monday that the former president would take part in a special conversation to discuss \"the most pressing issues facing the Black community\" with moderators Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor; and reporter Kadia Goba of Semafor.\n\nThe organization, which has hosted presidential hopefuls in the past, does not endorse political candidates.\n\n\"We look forward to our attendees hearing from former President Trump on the critical issues our members and their audiences care about most,\" NABJ President Ken Lemon said in a statement announcing the Q&A.\n\nThe session would give members an opportunity \"to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know,\" he added.\n\nTrump's campaign used the announcement to tout the Republican nominee's record, writing he's \"the only presidential candidate who can deliver results on day one\" and linking to polling showing Trump's popularity growing among Black men.\n\nThe chair of the NABJ's LGBTQ+ task force, Femi Redwood, said on X she was \"disturbed\" to not be included in discussions about whether to invite Trump, citing \"damage he has caused Black queer and trans people.\"\n\nCarron J. Phillips, a 2019 and 2020 NABJ award winner who described the convention as \"the only safe haven\" for Black journalists, wrote on X that Trump's presence made the space unsafe and called it \"single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history.\"\n\nSome members pointed to past Trump statements about Black journalists, including April Ryan, White House Correspondent for The Grio, who the former president once called \"very nasty\" and a \"loser.\" Ryan, the 2017 NABJ Journalist of the Year, said on X that the event featuring Trump was \"a slap in the face.\"\n\nDr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., the National Newspaper Publishers Association President and CEO, said in a statement he opposes Trump's scheduled appearance at the convention and urged NABJ leadership to withdraw the invitation.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome Black journalists defended the invitation. Leroy Chapman Jr., editor in chief of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said on X that he was looking forward to the session and that \"we need to 'normalize'\" presidential candidates answering questions from journalists. Symone D. Sanders Townsend, a political commentator on MSNBC, echoed the sentiment: \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did.\"\n\nLemon said NABJ invites presidential candidates to the convention every year and that the organization had engaged in conversations with both Trump and President Joe Biden for over a month. Biden had planned to attend before he dropped out of the race, and Harris is unable to speak in person because of other commitments, said a person familiar with her plans who was granted anonymity to talk about scheduling matters.\n\nSeveral Chicago-based groups -- including some that marched at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and plan to do the same at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month -- announced an emergency action to protest Trump's appearance at the convention.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

His attendance has kicked up a hornet's nest.\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists will have a special guest today at its convention in Chicago.\n\nDonald Trump.\n\nAnd just the announcement has kicked a hornet's nest of controversy.\n\nOn one hand, he is the former president of the United States and the Republican Party's nominee to be president again. Of course you should invite him, right? It's the chance to ask questions of someone who is running for president. You should want him there.\n\nThen again, this is a candidate who has openly criticized the press, has been disrespectful of Black female journalists and whose rhetoric has been accused by some of being racist. Why should -- and why would -- NABJ give him a platform?\n\nThat pretty much sums up the split going on among Black journalists from the moment it was announced Trump would sit down for a Q&A session moderated by Fox News' Harris Faulkner, Semafor's Kadia Goba and ABC News' Rachel Scott.\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Attiah announced on social media Tuesday that she was stepping down as co-chair of NABJ. She wrote, \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nAttiah was far from alone, as social media was filled with anger and frustration over NABJ's decision to invite Trump.\n\nTheGrio's April Ryan, the NABJ journalist of the year in 2017 who covered (and often was on the receiving end of verbal attacks from) Trump when he was president, wrote on X, \"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact. To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025. I object to this NABJ session with Donald Trump in Chicago.\"\n\nTiffany Walden, a co-founder and editor-in-chief of The TRiiBE, a digital platform that covers Black Chicago, told The Guardian's Adria R. Walker that NABJ's decision was \"irresponsible.\"\n\nIn a column for The TRiiBE, Tyler J. Davis wrote, \"NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated. People shouldn't be asked to choose between attending a useful session or a self-serving sideshow. They shouldn't be challenged to confront unsettling situations in an environment that is supposed to be welcoming for Black people. Uncomfortability and anxiety can be expected when the 'star' of the opening day has repeatedly belittled our profession and questioned our intentions.\"\n\nNABJ member and former Deadspin writer Carron J. Phillips tweeted, \"This is the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history. Whoever made this call is an idiot. And I'll say it to their face this week.\"\n\nFemi Redwood, the chair of NABJ's LGBTQ+ task force, wrote on X, \"I'm disappointed that in a space where so many queer and trans members still feel vulnerable will now feel even more unsafe due to Trump being invited and the possibility of his most vicious followers coming to the hotel to support him.\"\n\nRedwood added, \"I'm also disturbed that LGBTQ+ Task Force Leadership was not invited into conversations about hosting Trump considering the damage he has caused Black queer and trans people -- including those who are journalists and members of NABJ.\"\n\nThe Atlantic's Jemele Hill at first tweeted, \"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump,\" but later followed that up with, \"I'll say this, while I don't have a problem with Trump being at NABJ under the right circumstances because he's a presidential candidate, I don't know how 'right' these circumstances are. A sham of an interview will destroy the organization's credibility. If the majority of NABJ's membership is against Trump being there, the organization should listen. You have to answer to your membership and you run the risk of permanently disengaging folks. Trump isn't worth that.\"\n\nPart of the criticism, too, was that a Fox News anchor (Faulkner) would help moderate an event involving a candidate that the network has often been sympathetic toward.\n\nThis, mind you, was just a fraction of the backlash over NABJ's decision to have Trump.\n\nYet there was a strong opposing view, too, from those who firmly believe Trump, or any presidential candidate, should be invited. After all, it's fairly common for NABJ to invite presidential candidates to its convention. Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton all attended in the past, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris was invited this year.\n\nRana Cash, executive editor of The Charlotte Observer, tweeted, \"It's the National Association of Black 'Journalists' -- journalists who are experts at their craft, highly qualified and critical thinkers. To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous.\"\n\nLeroy Chapman Jr., the editor-in-chief of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said in a post on X, \"Here is what we need to 'normalize' -- candidates for office standing before journalists, answering questions.\"\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, said in a statement, \"While N.A.B.J. does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nIn a video, Lemon said, \"This is a great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground.\"\n\nMSNBC's Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former spokesperson for Kamala Harris, tweeted, \"Some of the best journalists in the country are members of NABJ. So, why wouldn't they interview Trump? He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions. NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions. That's happening Wednesday.\"\n\nNABJ conference co-chair Tia Mitchell, the Washington correspondent for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said on social media that she helped \"make this call\" to invite Trump, and \"I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next president.\"\n\nAs I mentioned, Harris also was invited, but NABJ said her confirmation was \"pending.\" Before he had dropped out of the race, President Joe Biden had agreed to attend the conference. But Harris might not be able to attend because of a scheduling conflict with her campaign.\n\nThere will be plenty of coverage of Trump's session at today's NABJ convention. It will be livestreamed on the organization's YouTube and Facebook pages. It is scheduled for noon Central time.\n\nPoynter's PolitiFact will fact-check the event, and I'll link to that coverage later this week.\n\nA major shakeup is coming to CBS News.\n\nNorah O'Donnell will step down as anchor and managing editor of the \"CBS Evening News\" following the November election. She will remain with the network, doing big interviews and contributing to the \"CBS Evening News,\" \"60 Minutes\" and other CBS News platforms.\n\nAnd, in what might be the real stunning news here, don't expect one big name to replace her.\n\nFirst, the O'Donnell part of this. Puck's Dylan Byers broke the news, with O'Donnell telling him, \"The way our product is distributed is changing. How do we do those big interviews, that great storytelling, and share that in a different kind of way so it can reach a different kind of audience.\"\n\nByers wrote, \"Wendy McMahon, the president and C.E.O. of CBS News, told me that the network was focused on 'challenging the traditional model' in order to find ways to leverage O'Donnell across more platforms.\"\n\nStill, the anchor of the national evening news is one of the most coveted jobs in TV journalism. It's hard to imagine someone giving up that job willingly to do something else within the news division at the same network. But Variety's Brian Steinberg wrote, \"The new arrangement is understood to be part of a longer-term commitment that the anchor and CBS News are making to one another.\"\n\nByers described it as a \"Barbara Walter-ish role\" and that it came about after O'Donnell's prime-time interview with Pope Francis in May. O'Donnell told Byers that it was a \"real lightbulb moment.\" She tells Byers she already has a list of interviews she wants to do -- and they are interviews she can't necessarily do now because of her current role.\n\nO'Donnell took over as anchor and managing editor of the \"CBS Evening News\" in 2019. Before that, she was co-host of \"CBS This Morning\" for seven years.\n\nShe told Byers, \"For 12 years I've been connected to an anchor desk. It's been grueling; it's also been thrilling. But CBS is awesome for allowing me to do this.\"\n\nSo, from outward appearances, it does seem as if O'Donnell and CBS News are both good with the move. In a memo to staff, O'Donnell wrote, \"It's time to do something different.\" She added it was her decision.\n\nNow what? Who replaces O'Donnell? My initial thought would be someone such as Margaret Brennan, the superb moderator of \"Face the Nation.\" But don't count on it.\n\nByers reports McMahon will announce plans in the days ahead, adding, \"In light of the secular economic challenges facing the industry, however, O'Donnell is unlikely to be replaced by another high-paid, high-profile anchor. Indeed, the evening broadcast will likely transition to an ensemble cast with rotating anchors -- making CBS the first network to relinquish the half-century-plus format of a singular, expensive anchor in the chair, signaling another retreat from the paradigm.\"\n\nIf true, that is a seismic shift for a network whose past \"Evening News\" anchors included such legends as Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and groundbreaking anchors such as Connie Chung and Katie Couric.\n\nO'Donnell did boost ratings for the \"Evening News,\" but the 4.4 million average viewers per newscast in the latest quarter still lagged behind ABC's \"World News Tonight\" and the \"NBC Nightly News.\" During the week of July 15-21, ABC's \"World News Tonight\" averaged 6.8 million viewers, the \"NBC Nightly News\" had 5.5 million and the \"CBS Evening News\" had 4 million, according to Nielsen.\n\nThe Academy Awards are looking for a new host.\n\nJimmy Kimmel, who has hosted four times before (and done an excellent job, if you ask me), has told the academy that he is not interested in hosting in 2025. That's also according to Puck's Dylan Byers.\n\nThe news is disappointing. As Byers wrote, \"When it comes to the Oscars, Jimmy Kimmel is well on his way to Bob Hope/Johnny Carson/Billy Crystal territory: reliable, familiar, always great, Disney-approved, and a nice balance of goodwill in the room and zingers for the home audience.\"\n\nByers reported that the Oscars then wanted John Mulaney to host, but the writer-comedian's schedule is simply too busy next March.\n\nSo it's back to the drawing board. Some of the names being thrown around just for fun: Chris Rock, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Neil Patrick Harris, although the 2015 host has said he probably wouldn't want to host again. I liked 2022 co-host Wanda Sykes, but she too said she likely wouldn't host again.\n\nHave feedback or a tip?

His appearance comes after June polling show Trump didn't gain much ground among Black voters before President Joe Biden dropped out, and Vice President Kamala Harris' first week as the presumptive nominee drummed up a lot of excitement among other Black organizations.\n\nFor some Black journalists, the decision to allow him to speak was \"tone deaf,\" as they say Trump has done harm for Chicago and the Black community.\n\nAgenda47 on crime: Trump proposes death-penalty for drug dealers, requiring stop and frisk\n\nVice President Kamala Harris also invited to speak at NABJ\n\nTrump has been invited to speak at the NABJ in the past. In 2016, he declined an invitation but Hillary Clinton made an appearance at the NABJ and National Association of Hispanic Journalists annual conference in Washington, D.C.\n\nHarris also received an invitation to the 2024 conference, according to the organization's release, but her participation has not yet been confirmed.\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush Jr., Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have also appeared at NABJ conventions in the past.\n\n\"We look forward to our attendees hearing from former President Trump on the critical issues our members and their audiences care about most,\" Lemon said in the release.\n\nTrump has long made Chicago a political 'punching bag'\n\nWhen Morgan Elise Johnson, publisher of The Triibe a Black-owned Chicago publication, heard the news late Monday night, questions immediately began swirling about the timing of and thought process behind the decision. She said the late night announcement made her feel like the organization was \"moving in a way that was disingenuous.\"\n\n\"I don't really know what NABJ hopes to get out of this event,\" Johnson said. \"I do not expect that what they will get is the truth out of Donald Trump's mouth.\"\n\nThough the costs of attending the convention is \"pretty astronomical,\" Johnson said she was planning on attending some NABJ events. But Monday's announcement raised safety concerns for her given that Trump was recently the target of an attempted assassination and the city's resources are already stretched thin hosting the music festival Lollapalooza and preparing for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn addition to the already chaotic atmosphere, she noted that Trump is not likely to be well received in the city after \"using Chicago as a punching bag in his political stump speeches.\"\n\n\"So, would I have invited Donald Trump? No...\" she said. \"I think the Black press needs to operate in the way that we always have, which is to protect Black people.\"\n\nFor Ernest Owens, president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists, the announcement was unsurprising. Owens, the Philadelphia editor at Eater and editor at large for Philadelphia Magazine, has been critical of NABJ in the past for what he described as a lack of transparency, pointing to Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah's statement on X as the latest example.\n\nAttiah said Tuesday she \"was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format\" and she has decided to step down as co-chair of the convention.\n\n\"Just because you can do something don't mean you should do something, and they have just not been with the times,\" Owens said of the NABJ. \"The idea of treating and normalizing Trump like he's just a regular presidential candidate, and not recognizing how detrimental and harmful he's been to not only the Black community, but to the Black press, is just a tone deaf decision.\"\n\nOwens, who is no longer an NABJ member, was not going to attend the conference and said he doesn't plan to watch the livestream of the Trump event calling it a \"waste of time and resources.\" He recalled that past conventions were a source of joy and positivity, but Trump's presence will likely put a damper on that atmosphere.\n\n\"Trump loves to dishearten and upset Black people, whether they're journalists, whether they're athletes, whether they're activists,\" he said. \"He likes to create this kind of chaos, and he's succeeded in that.\"\n\nEvent will be livestreamed, for those who want to watch\n\nHowever, Robin Ayers, a radio host at Tavis Smiley's KBLA 1580, wasn't planning on attending the convention until she heard Trump was planning to speak. Ayers said she is not an NABJ member and this would be her first time attending the conference.\n\nThough she understands what prompted the backlash from Black journalists, she said so long as Trump is held accountable for any false statements she's \"not mad at giving him a platform.\" One way this could be achieved, she suggested, is through live fact checking.\n\n\"There's value in hearing him out on things that we care about,\" she said. \"So the fact that he's actually going to be present with Black journalists is actually a pretty big deal, if they go about this the right way.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Trump campaign and NABJ for further comment. Trump's Q&A is scheduled for noon central time Wednesday, will be live streamed on NABJ YouTube and Facebook pages.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump will speak at NABJ convention in Chicago Wednesday", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kinsey_crowley@aol.com", "name": "Kinsey Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "n_dea_yancey_bragg@aol.com", "name": "N'dea Yancey-Bragg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Hispanic_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Hispanic Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lollapalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

His appearance comes after June polling show Trump didn't gain much ground among Black voters before President Joe Biden dropped out, and Vice President Kamala Harris' first week as the presumptive nominee drummed up a lot of excitement among other Black organizations.\n\nFor some Black journalists, the decision to allow him to speak was \"tone deaf,\" as they say Trump has done harm for Chicago and the Black community.\n\nAgenda47 on crime: Trump proposes death-penalty for drug dealers, requiring stop and frisk\n\nTrump has been invited to speak at the NABJ in the past. In 2016, he declined an invitation but Hillary Clinton made an appearance at the NABJ and National Association of Hispanic Journalists annual conference in Washington, D.C.\n\nHarris also received an invitation to the 2024 conference, according to the organization's release, but her participation has not yet been confirmed.\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush Jr., Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have also appeared at NABJ conventions in the past.\n\n\"We look forward to our attendees hearing from former President Trump on the critical issues our members and their audiences care about most,\" Lemon said in the release.\n\nWhen Morgan Elise Johnson, publisher of The Triibe a Black-owned Chicago publication, heard the news late Monday night, questions immediately began swirling about the timing of and thought process behind the decision. She said the late night announcement made her feel like the organization was \"moving in a way that was disingenuous.\"\n\n\"I don't really know what NABJ hopes to get out of this event,\" Johnson said. \"I do not expect that what they will get is the truth out of Donald Trump's mouth.\"\n\nThough the costs of attending the convention is \"pretty astronomical,\" Johnson said she was planning on attending some NABJ events. But Monday's announcement raised safety concerns for her given that Trump was recently the target of an attempted assassination and the city's resources are already stretched thin hosting the music festival Lollapalooza and preparing for the upcoming Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn addition to the already chaotic atmosphere, she noted that Trump is not likely to be well received in the city after \"using Chicago as a punching bag in his political stump speeches.\"\n\n\"So, would I have invited Donald Trump? No...\" she said. \"I think the Black press needs to operate in the way that we always have, which is to protect Black people.\"\n\nFor Ernest Owens, president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists, the announcement was unsurprising. Owens, the Philadelphia editor at Eater and editor at large for Philadelphia Magazine, has been critical of NABJ in the past for what he described as a lack of transparency, pointing to Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah's statement on X as the latest example.\n\nAttiah said Tuesday she \"was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format\" and she has decided to step down as co-chair of the convention.\n\n\"Just because you can do something don't mean you should do something, and they have just not been with the times,\" Owens said of the NABJ. \"The idea of treating and normalizing Trump like he's just a regular presidential candidate, and not recognizing how detrimental and harmful he's been to not only the Black community, but to the Black press, is just a tone deaf decision.\"\n\nOwens, who is no longer an NABJ member, was not going to attend the conference and said he doesn't plan to watch the livestream of the Trump event calling it a \"waste of time and resources.\" He recalled that past conventions were a source of joy and positivity, but Trump's presence will likely put a damper on that atmosphere.\n\n\"Trump loves to dishearten and upset Black people, whether they're journalists, whether they're athletes, whether they're activists,\" he said. \"He likes to create this kind of chaos, and he's succeeded in that.\"\n\nHowever, Robin Ayers, a radio host at Tavis Smiley's KBLA 1580, wasn't planning on attending the convention until she heard Trump was planning to speak. Ayers said she is not an NABJ member and this would be her first time attending the conference.\n\nThough she understands what prompted the backlash from Black journalists, she said so long as Trump is held accountable for any false statements she's \"not mad at giving him a platform.\" One way this could be achieved, she suggested, is through live fact checking.\n\n\"There's value in hearing him out on things that we care about,\" she said. \"So the fact that he's actually going to be present with Black journalists is actually a pretty big deal, if they go about this the right way.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Trump campaign and NABJ for further comment.

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 p.m. CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nTrump and NABJ also have a tense history over his treatment of Black women journalists. In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump for repeatedly using words such as \"stupid,\" \"loser\" and \"nasty\" to describe Black women journalists including several Black journalists such as Yamiche Alcindor of NBC News; Abby Phillip of CNN; and April Ryan of The Grio.\n\n\"The most powerful man in the free world is verbally abusing journalists,\" said then-NABJ President Sarah Glover. \"His dismissive comments toward journalists April Ryan, Abby Phillip and Yamiche Alcindor are appalling, irresponsible, and should be denounced.\"\n\nWhen Trump told Alcindor \"don't be threatening\" during a 2020 press conference, then-NABJ President Dorothy Tucker condemned the remarks as \"not only unnecessary but demeaning and inappropriate.\"\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all attended NABJ. President Biden attended a virtual NABJ panel during his 2020 run for president where he received criticism for saying: \"Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community.\"\n\nBut for many NABJ members, the decision to host Trump polarizes the organization and threatens the convention's ethos, which aspires to safeguard and advance Black journalists.\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J.

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 p.m. CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nTrump and NABJ also have a tense history over his treatment of Black women journalists. In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump for repeatedly using words such as \"stupid,\" \"loser\" and \"nasty\" to describe Black women journalists including several Black journalists such as Yamiche Alcindor of NBC News; Abby Phillip of CNN; and April Ryan of The Grio.\n\n\"The most powerful man in the free world is verbally abusing journalists,\" said then-NABJ President Sarah Glover. \"His dismissive comments toward journalists April Ryan, Abby Phillip and Yamiche Alcindor are appalling, irresponsible, and should be denounced.\"\n\nWhen Trump told Alcindor \"don't be threatening\" during a 2020 press conference, then-NABJ President Dorothy Tucker condemned the remarks as \"not only unnecessary but demeaning and inappropriate.\"\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all attended NABJ. President Biden attended a virtual NABJ panel during his 2020 run for president where he received criticism for saying: \"Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community.\"\n\nBut for many NABJ members, the decision to host Trump polarizes the organization and threatens the convention's ethos, which aspires to safeguard and advance Black journalists.\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nYet, Lemon and other leaders at NABJ have faced internal backlash and calls to resign since Trump's appearance was announced.\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 p.m. CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\nTrump and NABJ also have a tense history over his treatment of Black women journalists. In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump for repeatedly using words such as \"stupid,\" \"loser\" and \"nasty\" to describe Black women journalists including several Black journalists such as Yamiche Alcindor of NBC News; Abby Phillip of CNN; and April Ryan of The Grio.\n\n\"The most powerful man in the free world is verbally abusing journalists,\" said then-NABJ President Sarah Glover. \"His dismissive comments toward journalists April Ryan, Abby Phillip and Yamiche Alcindor are appalling, irresponsible, and should be denounced.\"\n\nWhen Trump told Alcindor \"don't be threatening\" during a 2020 press conference, then-NABJ President Dorothy Tucker condemned the remarks as \"not only unnecessary but demeaning and inappropriate.\"\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all attended NABJ. President Biden attended a virtual NABJ panel during his 2020 run for president where he received criticism for saying: \"Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community.\"\n\nBut for many NABJ members, the decision to host Trump polarizes the organization and threatens the convention's ethos, which aspires to safeguard and advance Black journalists.\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nYet, Lemon and other leaders at NABJ have faced internal backlash and calls to resign since Trump's appearance was announced.\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.\n\nAssociated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@maryvilleforum.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Phillip", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abby Phillip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamiche_Alcindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yamiche Alcindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "April Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGrio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TheGrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

The GOP presidential nominee is set to take questions from a panel of three journalists.\n\nAmid the furor, the convention's co-chair, Karen Attiah, announced Tuesday that she was stepping down from her role as an organizer of the meeting.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Ms. Attiah, a longtime Washington Post columnist, said on X. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nJournalist April Ryan, whom Mr. Trump called a \"loser\" when she covered his presidency, said, \"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact.\" The NABJ named her its journalist of the year in 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office.\n\n\"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025,\" she said on X. \"I object to this NABJ session with Donald Trump in Chicago.\"\n\nProject 2025 is a policy document authored by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank.

His campaign said he will answer questions \"that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon said they're looking forward to \"attendees hearing from former President Trump on the critical issues our members and their audiences care about most.\"\n\n\"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know,\" Mr. Lemon said.\n\nMs. Ryan became the longest-serving Black female White House correspondent in 2022. In 2018, while she was the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks, she had an encounter with Mr. Trump in which he wound up calling her a \"loser\" and \"nasty.\" He also repeatedly told her to \"sit down.\"\n\n\"[It] was one of the ugliest moments I have ever seen or felt in my life,\" she told \"Morning Joe\" hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski in 2022.\n\nOn X, Jim Trotter, the 2023 NABJ journalist of the year, called the invitation of Mr. Trump \"a poor decision,\" so much so that \"it's difficult to put into words.\"\n\nPublicist Lauren Paige called it a \"horrible choice,\" in her statement on X.\n\n\"NABJ, I understand being unbiased but having the man who has and continues to actively disrespect media and Black media like did we forget how he treated April Ryan and other journalists?\" she wrote.\n\nMr. Trump has touted that he has done more for Black Americans during his time in office than other presidents, with a \"possible exception\" of former President Abraham Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Polls taken before President Biden dropped out of the race earlier this month showed Mr. Trump making significant gains among Black voters compared with the 2020 election.\n\n\"Historic rates of Black voters now support President Trump, and the reason is simple: Black voters know that President Trump is the only presidential candidate who can deliver results on day one because he already has,\" the

In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump for repeatedly using words such as \"stupid,\" \"loser\" and \"nasty\" to describe Black women journalists including several Black journalists such as Yamiche Alcindor of NBC News; Abby Phillip of CNN; and April Ryan of The Grio.\n\n\"The most powerful man in the free world is verbally abusing journalists,\" said then-NABJ President Sarah Glover. \"His dismissive comments toward journalists April Ryan, Abby Phillip and Yamiche Alcindor are appalling, irresponsible, and should be denounced.\"\n\nWhen Trump told Alcindor \"don't be threatening\" during a 2020 press conference, then-NABJ President Dorothy Tucker condemned the remarks as \"not only unnecessary but demeaning and inappropriate.\"\n\nFormer presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have all attended NABJ. President Biden attended a virtual NABJ panel during his 2020 run for president where he received criticism for saying: \"Unlike the African American community, with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community.\"\n\nBut for many NABJ members, the decision to host Trump polarizes the organization and threatens the convention's ethos, which aspires to safeguard and advance Black journalists.\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nYet, Lemon and other leaders at NABJ have faced internal backlash and calls to resign since Trump's appearance was announced.\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_Phillip", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abby Phillip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamiche_Alcindor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yamiche Alcindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "April Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGrio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TheGrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

She didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for additional comment Tuesday.\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon backed the decision to have Trump appear at the convention.\n\n\"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know,\" Lemon said in a statement.\n\nThe NABJ also invited Vice President and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris to participate in the convention and \"her confirmation is pending,\" the organization said in a statement late Monday. Other former chief executives, including former President Barack Obama, have participated in NABJ conventions either as while in office or as candidates, the statement noted.\n\nThe convention is being held at the Hilton Chicago on South Michigan Avenue. Trump is scheduled to take questions at noon from a panel of three reporters, Rachel Scott of ABC News, Harris Faulkner of Fox News and Kadia Goba of the digital publication Semafor. The discussion will be open to convention attendees and livestreamed, but not open to the public.\n\nTrump's first publicly announced visit to Chicago in years would come just a few weeks before the full force of the Democratic Party descends on the city for its national convention. The party is expected to celebrate the historic presidential nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris, who would be the first Black woman to lead a presidential ticket.\n\nWhile supporters of the NABJ's decision pointed to journalists' responsibility to ask questions of people in power, others said that the industry convention was not the proper venue for Trump, who in the past has made offensive statements at the expense of people of color and the city of Chicago.\n\n\"And like many people said, this is where you go to get away from the hostility of your newsroom. It's supposed to be your safe space,\" Chicago-based journalist and author Arionne Nettles wrote of the convention, which serves as a gathering and networking space for Black journalists.\n\nTia Mitchell, a Washington-based correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said she helped make the decision to host Trump and in a social media post nodded to the organization's history of interviewing politicians and presidential candidates.\n\n\"Members can disagree. No one is forcing them to attend. But there is precedent of such invitations and great care taken with this particular one,\" Mitchell wrote.\n\nReached by phone, NABJ Executive Director Drew Berry declined to comment on the decision to host Trump and redirected the question to the organization's press office, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson issued a statement on social media saying the city is prepared for Trump's visit.\n\n\"My administration's values and practice are in complete opposition to former President Donald Trump's agenda, but I want the people of Chicago to know that city departments and agencies are fully prepared to uphold safety during his scheduled visit,\" Johnson wrote on X.\n\nTrump's campaign confirmed the appearance late Monday night, saying in an emailed statement that he was to \"participate in a conversation with journalists.\"\n\n\"Black voters know that President Trump is the only presidential candidate who can deliver results on day one because he already has,\" the Trump campaign said in the statement.\n\nTrump and Republicans have courted Black voters ahead of the November election, particularly by touting the former president's economic policies. But his campaign agenda also has called for expanding police practices such as stop and frisk that have disproportionately affected Black Americans.\n\nDuring Trump's first visit to Chicago as president in 2019, he was met by hundreds of protesters and lobbed criticism at the city's then-police superintendent and other city leaders.\n\nAs a candidate for president in 2016, Trump was forced to cancel a rally at the University of Illinois Chicago Pavilion amid security concerns as thousands of protesters demonstrated in the area.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

They decried the decision to invite a presidential candidate who has lambasted Black journalists, led a movement to squash diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and who is responsible for increased anti-journalistic sentiment, including the popularization of the term \"fake news\" to describe factual, but potentially unflattering, reporting.\n\nTiffany Walden, a co-founder and editor-in-chief of The TRiiBE, a digital platform that focuses on Black Chicago, told the Guardian that NABJ's decision was \"irresponsible\".\n\n\"We've watched Trump threaten to send the feds here when he was in office,\" Walden said. \"We've watched him use Chicago as a dog whistle in all of his campaign's materials during his first run for office. He talked about Chicago having top gang thugs. So this puts the city of Chicago and its residents in a very vulnerable position. It also puts Black journalists in a very vulnerable position at a convention that's supposed to be a safe space for them.\"\n\nAmeshia Cross, a political analyst, echoed this sentiment on X: \"The same Trump that attacked Black journalists from the stump. The same Trump who is attacking DEI, can't get ahead of his own racism and sexism. And the guy who wants to dissolve journalism as we know it, that's who is speaking at #NABJ24 w/ record attendance. C'mon yall.\"\n\nAnother journalist, Carron J Phillips, called the move \"the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history\".\n\nThe outcry led to the NABJ president, Ken Lemon, and others defending the decision, saying that Black reporters should have the opportunity to question a political candidate.\n\n\"Every year, every presidential election cycle, we invite the presidential candidates to come,\" Lemon said to NABJ student journalists on Tuesday. \"We extend that to anyone who is a nominee and in this case we have two presumptive nominees. We invited both of them ... This is an important hour. We have people whose lives are depending on what happens in November ... This is a great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground.\"\n\nKamala Harris is scheduled to speak elsewhere on Wednesday, when Trump will be at NABJ, but her confirmation to attend this year's convention, which lasts through Sunday, is \"pending\", according to NABJ.\n\nTia Mitchell, the chair of NABJ's political journalism taskforce and a Washington correspondent at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, wrote on X: \"I helped make this call. And it's in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades. But continue to go off on your feed. I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\" (Mitchell, NABJ and NABJ's Chicago chapter did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nWednesday's panel will be moderated by Rachel Scott, a senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, who anchors The Faulkner Focus and Outnumbered for Fox News; and Kadia Goba, a politics reporter for Semafor.\n\n\"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump,\" Jemele Hill, a contributing reporter for the Atlantic, wrote on X. \"The reality is that he is running for president and needs to be treated as such. Being questioned by journalists is part of the job, and especially important in the company of Black journalists. Mainstream media keeps trying to convince us that he actually is gaining support among Black people. Let's see if it's true.\"\n\nBut the journalist Matthew Wright pushed back on the notion that there was anything productive in questioning Trump.\n\n\"What does that serve?\" Wright said to the Guardian. \"We literally just watched him talk to Laura Ingraham [who] was trying to get him to answer different questions, but he practically played evasive of action even then. If a super conservative white woman can't get straight answers out of him, what makes you think that three black women are going to get them?\"\n\nIn a statement about the NABJ appearance, Trump's campaign wrote: \"President Trump accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history.\" Some journalists used this statement as evidence that NABJ's decision to platform the former president was harmful, and would lead to further perpetuation of falsehoods.\n\n\"This is the way 45 is touting his appearance before @nabj this week. Was this what you wanted [Tia Mitchell]? He is already lying and he isn't even in Chicago yet. This is your legacy,\" April Reign, a media strategist, wrote on X.\n\nThe timing of the panel announcement - less than 48 hours before the convention's start - also drew concern from NABJ members.\n\nShamira Ibrahim, a culture writer, told the Guardian that she was shocked by the decision.\n\n\"It puts everyone in a really bad position,\" Ibrahim said. \"You already paid your convention fees, you already paid for a hotel that's likely not refundable at this point, flights are likely difficult to get replaced. Even if you have a moral opposition to it or an ethical opposition to it, you're kind of already stuck in whatever plan you made.\"\n\nNABJ's annual convention has allowed Black journalists a space to fellowship and gather safely since the organization's founding in 1975, with some reporters likening it to a family reunion. Inviting Trump, Ibrahim said, undermined that sense of community.\n\n\"NABJ is primarily not just a place for journalists to get opportunities to interview politicians, but also a place for Black journalists to network, to have open conversations about things that are happening in the industry, to attend panels, and really get a sense of how to shift in a very, very volatile, fragile space,\" she continued.\n\n\"Inviting someone who, one, has made targeted attacks on Black journalists, two, has actively been responsible in defunding programs that help build Black journalists, and three, has publicly attacked the Black press flies in the face of any sort of fidelity convention.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a coalition of organizations, including Chicago Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression and Anti-War Committee Chicago, announced plans to rally outside the convention to \"tell Trump he's not welcome in Chicago\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The group gives out more than $100,000 in scholarships every year. HuffPost journalists often attend the NABJ's annual conferences.\n\nThe group's decision to platform Trump has been met with widespread criticism. Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said Tuesday she will step down from her role as a co-chair for this year's NABJ gathering.\n\n\"I have decided to step down as co-chair from this year's #NABJ24 convention in Chicago,\" Attiah posted on X, the former Twitter. \"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck.\"\n\nSports writer Carron Phillips, who said he is attending the convention, called Trump's scheduled appearance \"the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history.\"\n\n\"Whoever made this call is an idiot,\" Phillips wrote on X. \"And I'll say it to their face this week.\"\n\nJason Ingram, a sports producer, made similar remarks.\n\n\"As a member of NABJ for over 20 years, this is the worst decision they have ever made,\" Ingram said on X. \"I am truly disappointed in everyone involved with this decision. Dude doesn't care about black people!!!!\"\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon said in a statement that interviewing Trump will give Black journalists the \"opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign praised the former president's supposed accomplishments for Black Americans under his term.\n\n\"President Trump accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America First policies on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, and foreign policy,\" the statement said.\n\nIn the past, Trump -- who is now the 2024 Republican nominee for president -- questioned President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship, and in 2020 promoted the false claim that Vice President Kamala Harris also might not be a U.S. citizen. (Obama was born in Hawaii, while Harris was born in California.) Earlier this year, Trump lobbed a similar lie at Nikki Haley, who competed against him in the 2024 primary. Haley was born in South Carolina and served as Republican governor of the state from 2011 to 2017.\n\nTrump also called for the Central Park Five -- a group of Black and Latino teens wrongly accused of raping a white woman -- to be executed in a full-page newspaper ad in 1989. Trump has never apologized for his calls to kill the teens, who today, as adults, are known as the Exonerated Five.\n\nHarris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has also been invited to the NABJ convention.

It will be livestreamed at 1 p.m. ET on the group's Facebook and YouTube pages.\n\nThe event gives Trump, who won just 12% of Black voters in his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden, an opportunity to directly appeal to voters of color.\n\nBut he may have more trouble courting these voters in a competition against Harris, who is the first Black person, first woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.\n\nSome polls already show that Harris has more support among Black, Latino and young voters than Biden did before she replaced him as the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, a new Bloomberg/Morning Consult survey of battleground states found that Harris has effectively eliminated Trump's lead in the seven battleground states likely to determine which candidate wins the Electoral College.\n\nThe Trump campaign, in a press release Monday night announcing his NABJ appearance, claimed that he \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history.\"\n\nThe decision by NABJ, the nation's largest association of journalists of color, to host Trump quickly spurred a backlash both inside and outside the group.\n\nConvention co-chair Karen Attiah resigned her position on the eve of the event, writing in a social media post, \"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck.\"\n\nShe added in follow-up post, \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon, responding to the Trump event, wrote on X that the group understands \"the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nTia Mitchell, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution correspondent and NABJ program co-chair, defended the move, saying it is \"in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades.\"\n\nHarris, however, will not be at the convention.\n\nWhile then-candidate Biden had planned to attend the event, a person familiar with Harris' plans told NBC News that the vice president could not fit a convention appearance into her schedule this week. Harris' overlapping plans include attending the funeral of late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, and the ongoing process of selecting a running mate.\n\nThat person said NABJ had declined a request by Harris' team to let the vice president appear for a virtual fireside chat, or to schedule an in-person event with the group at a later date.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Phillips notably called out NABJ as being \"idiotic\" in a series of social media posts.\n\n\"Y'all just made the only safe haven that Black journalists have, potentially unsafe, all because y'all want to look 'smarter than everybody else,' when this is....idiotic at best,\" Phillips posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThat post followed another from Phillips in which he claimed inviting Trump is \"the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history. Whoever made this call is an idiot. And I'll say it to their face this week.\"\n\nTia Mitchell, the Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the chairperson of NABJ's Political Task Force, responded to Phillips' first post by identifying herself as someone who \"helped make this call.\"\n\nMitchell went on to defend the decision to invite Trump to address Black journalists as a standing precedent that is \"in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades.\"\n\nNABJ's invitation to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is still pending, the group said.\n\nMitchell, who also addressed other posts critical of NABJ's decision to host Trump, vowed to \"continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next president.\"\n\nThat was likely no solace for Jim Trotter, NABJ's 2023 Journalist of the Year who called it such \"a poor decision by @NABJ that it's difficult to put into words.\"\n\nThe Grio's April Ryan, who was named NABJ's 2017 Journalist of the Year, fully condemned the group hosting Trump.\n\n\"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025,\" Ryan wrote Tuesday in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter. \"I object to this NABJ session with Donald Trump in Chicago.\"\n\nRoland Martin, a former winner of NABJ's coveted Journalist of the Year Award who has been active within the organization for years, called out the organization for not choosing a Black male journalist to help moderate the event; what with the myriad reports suggesting Trump has made notable inroads with Black male voters.\n\nIt also can't be ignored that NABJ decided against any Black-owned and operated media participating in the event.\n\nAn email seeking comment from NABJ was not immediately returned.\n\nAdding to the outrage was NABJ President Ken Lemon's statement that predicted Trump -- a proven and habitual unabashed liar -- \"will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nMitchell and Lemon were not alone in their defense of NABJ.\n\nJemele Hill, NABJ's 2018 Journalist of the Year, suggested she understood NABJ's invitation to Trump - with whom she clashed in 2017 about the topic of white supremacy - and said she's \"not mad about him being there. If there is any room I'd want to see how he operates in, it's in the company of 3,000 Black journalists.\"\n\nHill suggested there could be a reaction similar to when NABJ hosted then-Trump aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman at its convention in New Orleans in 2017.\n\nThat was when several activists and journalists turned their backs on Manigault-Newman as she spoke during a panel discussion moderated by journalist Ed Gordon. The panel ended when Manigault-Newman walked off of the stage as then-NABJ President Sarah Glover explained why she was invited to speak.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign has already seized on the opportunity of the optics of him being surrounded by Black professionals by boasting about the NABJ invitation in a late-night email on Monday that was -- surprise! -- replete with lies.\n\n\"President Trump accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history,\" a campaign press release says in part without substantiating such a claim with any quantifiable data. Instead, the press release goes on to state without proof that \"Black voters know that President Trump is the only presidential candidate who can deliver results on day one because he already has, including landmark unemployment rates for Black Americans, increased median income for Black households, historic permanent funding for HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), comprehensive bipartisan criminal justice reform, and nearly $50 billion in funds to revitalize Opportunity Zones.\"\n\n(To be sure, President Joe Biden has delivered the lowest Black unemployment rate on record; the Associated Press reported that \"Trump is exaggerating economic gains for African Americans during his administration;\" records show that Trump never requested increased funding for HBCUs during his presidency; the so-called First Step Act criminal justice reform bill signed by Trump \"never produced the spike in support from Black voters that he expected,\" Politico reported; and Trump's 2017 tax plan that created Opportunity Zones -- efforts meant to revitalize urban neighborhoods -- never achieved the desired economic growth in low-income communities and were exploited by investors, PBS reported.)\n\nBut as Trump has repeatedly demonstrated, facts don't matter when it comes to his rhetoric, which is in direct conflict with the foundation of journalism and its mission to report the truth.\n\nConsidering that coming collision of circumstances in Chicago, something's likely got to give on Wednesday.\n\nWhite Editor Goes Viral For Twitter Thread About Media Racism Black Journalists Face\n\nBlack Journalists Association Says CBS Must Change 'Toxic Culture'\n\nA Timeline Of Trump's Unprovoked Attacks On Black Women 12 photos", "source": {"uri": "newsone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News One"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_c_t_wright@newsone.com", "name": "Bruce C.T.

They decried the decision to invite a presidential candidate who has lambasted Black journalists, led a movement to squash diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and who is responsible for increased anti-journalistic sentiment, including the popularization of the term \"fake news\" to describe factual, but potentially unflattering, reporting.\n\nTiffany Walden, a co-founder and editor-in-chief of The TriiBE, a digital platform that focuses on Black Chicago, told the Guardian that NABJ's decision was \"irresponsible\".\n\n\"We've watched Trump threaten to send the feds here when he was in office,\" Walden said. \"We've watched him use Chicago as a dog whistle in all of his campaign's materials during his first run for office. He talked about Chicago having top gang thugs. So this puts the city of Chicago and its residents in a very vulnerable position. It also puts Black journalists in a very vulnerable position at a convention that's supposed to be a safe space for them.\"\n\nAmeshia Cross, a political analyst, echoed this sentiment on X: \"The same Trump that attacked Black journalists from the stump. The same Trump who is attacking DEI, can't get ahead of his own racism and sexism. And the guy who wants to dissolve journalism as we know it, that's who is speaking at #NABJ24 w/ record attendance. C'mon yall.\"\n\nAnother journalist, Carron J Phillips, called the move \"the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history\".\n\nThe outcry led to NABJ president Ken Lemon and others defending the decision, saying that Black reporters should have the opportunity to question a political candidate.\n\n\"Every year, every presidential election cycle, we invite the presidential candidates to come,\" Lemon said to NABJ student journalists on Tuesday. \"We extend that to anyone who is a nominee and in this case we have two presumptive nominees. We invited both of them ... This is an important hour. We have people whose lives are depending on what happens in November ... This is a great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground.\"\n\nKamala Harris is scheduled to speak elsewhere on Wednesday, when Trump will be at NABJ, but her confirmation to attend this year's convention, which lasts through Sunday, is \"pending\", according to NABJ.\n\nTia Mitchell, the chair of NABJ's political journalism task force and a Washington correspondent at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, wrote on X: \"I helped make this call. And it's in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades. But continue to go off on your feed. I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\" (Mitchell, NABJ and NABJ's Chicago chapter did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nWednesday's panel will be moderated by Rachel Scott, a senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, who anchors \"The Faulkner Focus\" and \"Outnumbered\" for FOX News; and Kadia Goba, a politics reporter for Semafor.\n\n\"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump,\" Jemele Hill, a contributing reporter for the Atlantic, wrote on X. \"The reality is that he is running for president and needs to be treated as such. Being questioned by journalists is part of the job, and especially important in the company of Black journalists. Mainstream media keeps trying to convince us that he actually is gaining support among Black people. Let's see if it's true.\"\n\nBut the journalist Matthew Wright pushed back on the notion that there is anything productive in questioning Trump.\n\n\"What does that serve?\" Wright said to the Guardian. \"We literally just watched him talk to Laura Ingraham [who] was trying to get him to answer different questions, but he practically played evasive of action even then. If a super conservative white woman can't get straight answers out of him, what makes you think that three black women are going to get them?\"\n\nIn a statement about the NABJ appearance, Trump's campaign wrote: \"President Trump accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history.\" Some journalists used this statement as evidence that NABJ's decision to platform the former president was harmful, and would lead to further perpetuation of falsehoods.\n\n\"This is the way 45 is touting his appearance before @nabj this week. Was this what you wanted [Tia Mitchell]? He is already lying and he isn't even in Chicago yet. This is your legacy,\" April Reign, a media strategist, wrote on X.\n\nThe timing of the panel announcement - less than 48 hours before the convention's start - also drew concern from NABJ members.\n\nShamira Ibrahim, a culture writer, told the Guardian that she was shocked by the decision.\n\n\"It puts everyone in a really bad position,\" Ibrahim said. \"You already paid your convention fees, you already paid for a hotel that's likely not refundable at this point, flights are likely difficult to get replaced. Even if you have a moral opposition to it or an ethical opposition to it, you're kind of already stuck in whatever plan you made.\"\n\nNABJ's annual convention has allowed Black journalists a space to fellowship and gather safely since the organization's founding in 1975, with some reporters likening it to a family reunion. Inviting Trump, Ibrahim said, undermines that sense of community.\n\n\"NABJ is primarily not just a place for journalists to get opportunities to interview politicians, but also a place for black journalists to network, to have open conversations about things that are happening in the industry, to attend panels, and really get a sense of how to shift in a very, very volatile, fragile space,\" she continued.\n\n\"Inviting someone who, one, has made targeted attacks on black journalists, two, has actively been responsible in defunding programs that help build Black journalists, and three, has publicly attacked the Black press flies in the face of any sort of fidelity convention.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a coalition of organizations, including Chicago Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression and Anti-War Committee Chicago, announced plans to rally outside the convention to \"tell Trump he's not welcome in Chicago\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on X, adding that she had not been \"involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nGiven Trump's adoration of authoritarianism, coupled with the vile campaign he has waged for years on the fourth estate, his appearance at any media-focused conference would be certain to generate heightened levels of controversy. But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference.

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nGET RELIABLE SOURCES IN YOUR INBOX\n\nA daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape with uncompromising reporting and analysis. Sign up here for the Reliable Sources newsletter.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on X, adding that she had not been \"involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nGiven Trump's adoration of authoritarianism, coupled with the vile campaign he has waged for years on the fourth estate, his appearance at any media-focused conference would be certain to generate heightened levels of controversy. But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris' schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.\n\n\"The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,\" the person said. \"The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\n\"Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,\" the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. \"The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_darcy@cnn.com", "name": "Oliver Darcy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojangles_Coliseum", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bojangles Coliseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_Sources", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reliable Sources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Correspondents' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireside chats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

This is particularly prescient among Black men, who have become quite vocal about no longer supporting the party and its aims, which are counter to their concerns and issues. Fox Digital interviewed attendees at a July 27 Grand Rapids, MI, Trump Rally, and they sounded off about what the Democrat Party gets wrong about them.\n\nWATCH:\n\nSomething else is causing a stir among the Black intelligentsia. Some are highly upset that the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) plans to have a conversation with former President and GOP nominee Donald Trump at their annual Convention & Career Fair in Chicago.\n\nNABJ president Ken Lemon made it clear that this is nothing out of the norm -- for decades, the NABJ has invited presidential candidates from both sides of the aisle to attend. Some have chosen to attend, while others have not. Vice President and selected Democrat nominee for president Kamala Harris was also invited. The NAJB said in their announcement that her confirmation is \"pending.\" So, this conversation is not an endorsement of Trump or any other candidate, but an opportunity for a group of small outlet and large outlet journalists to dig into facts and information on issues that matter to Black Americans and present those to their readers and followers, as opposed to relying on the major newsfeeds like AP and Reuters.\n\nWhile NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\n\nThe NABJ convention opens on Wednesday, July 31, and they will host the Trump conversation at 12:00 p.m. Central Time.\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald J. Trump will participate in a conversation with journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) Annual Convention & Career Fair during its opening day in Chicago on Wednesday, July 31, at noon CST.\n\nTrump will engage in a Q&A with political journalists before an audience of registered convention attendees that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\n\nThe event will be moderated by Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, anchor of The Faulkner Focus and co-host of Outnumbered on FOX News; and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor.\n\nThe three Black female journalists moderating the discussion represent Left, Right, and independent or centrist journalism. So, where's the problem? Well, the fact that Fox News senior correspondent and Faulkner Focus host Harris Faulkner isn't considered a serious journalist by certain members of the NABJ. And even though the announcement clearly states there will be a Q&A for other journalists to submit their questions, the hue and cry of \"Trump lies,\" \"Trump is evil,\" ad infinitum has populated the comments and replies on the NABJ Headquarters X announcement. The event hasn't even happened yet, and the gatekeepers of Democrat orthodoxy are eliciting their displeasure. How dare the NABJ have a sit down with a convicted felon and insurrectionist?\n\nBringing Trump's evil into a Black safe space? Clutch the pearls!\n\nThis Auntie is all types of confused over this move, not to mention appalled.\n\nThe last time I checked, that used to be what journalists did: amplify the news on presidential candidates so that every voter, no matter what their political leanings, is informed. \"Pulitzer nominee\" Carron J. Phillips really let it be known that whoever organized this lacks intellectual muster.\n\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution Washington Correspondent Tia Mitchell was a co-organizer and clapped back at Phillips.\n\nI helped make this call. And it's in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades. But continue to go off on your feed. I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\n\nAs she should, because this is called responsible journalism. But some people refuse to be placated and are entrenched in their indoctrination.\n\nI understand the concerns about Trump. Which is why we selected a group of badass journalists to ask him questions, creating a rare opportunity to dig into his vision for America and ask Qs. We cannot ignore someone who could be the next leader of the free world.\n\nIt is telling that after the announcement went out on Monday and the kerfuffle that followed, Mitchell has locked down her account.\n\nDr. Nikki Johnson called it as she saw it. The elites, Black or otherwise, are not happy about Black people being informed.\n\nMost surprising, the editor-in-chief of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution had Mitchell's back. It should not be a point of controversy and debate that a leading presidential candidate is allowed a platform where journalists get to ask him questions and he answers them. It should be the norm. When did we lose sight of that?\n\nThe event will not be open to the public but will be live-streamed on the National Association of Black Journalist's YouTube channel and Facebook page.\n\nThe other recent development comes from Black Twitter and a more vocal contingent of Black male conservatives who were appalled by the White Dudes for Kamala Harris call on Monday night. So, they decided to mount their own ZOOM call on Tuesday night titled: \"Black People Against Kamala Harris.\"\n\nAllegedly Over 50,000 people joined the White Dudes For Kamala Zoom from all across the country. We are fighting this propaganda to show them what real support is. We encourage you to join the influential Black Women and Men in this call to prove that majority of America is against Kamala Harris.\n\nExpected to join the call are Judge Joe Brown, actor and activist Isaiah Washington, founder of the X School for Boys King Randall, Veteran and activist Billy Ray Todd, FL District 24 candidate Lavern Spicer, Veteran and podcaster Rob Smith, and a number of other prominent and lesser-known Black conservative voices.\n\nWe are honored to have you join us in securing this election, they have the LIES but we have the NUMBERS.\n\nOnly time will tell whether the outcry matches the number of actual voters and which candidate will benefit from this engagement. But know this: it is no longer business as usual for Blacks in the political space.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Phillips wrote, calling Trump's appearance \"the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history.\"\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" 2017 NABJ journalist of the year April Ryan wrote. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee.\"\n\nWhile many journalists have voiced criticism, others, like the Atlanta Journal Constitution's Tia Mitchell and Jemele Hill, pointed to the precedence. As NABJ noted in its press release, Presidents George W. Bush Jr., Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton have all attended previous conferences.\n\n\"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump,\" Hill wrote on X. \"The reality is that he is running for president and needs to be treated as such. Being questioned by journalists is part of the job, and especially important in the company of Black journalists. Mainstream media keeps trying to convince us that he actually is gaining support among Black people. Let's see if it's true.\"\n\nAdded Mitchell: \"I helped make this call. And it's in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades. But continue to go off on your feed. I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\"\n\nIn the Trump campaign's announcement about the NABJ event, it noted how he \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America First policies on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, and foreign policy.\" It's a claim that Trump has touted since his 2020 campaign, though a Washington Post fact check called these assertions unfounded.\n\n\"The claim that Trump has exceeded every other president since Lincoln earned only derision from prominent historians,\" Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler wrote in 2020. \"Instead, they said Lyndon B.

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 p.m. CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we\u00b4re doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn\u00b4t a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It\u00b4s a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally, Saturday, July 27, 2024, in St. Cloud, Minn. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization\u00b4s constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.\n\nAssociated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

After it was announced that Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump would be in attendance for a Q&A session with Black journalists, observers on X lashed out at the NABJ in outrage.\n\nOn Monday (July 29), NABJ officials confirmed that Donald Trump would be attending the opening day of the convention and job fair event, which will not be open to the public but will air online via streaming. Trump did not attend the convention during his four years as president so his inclusion this year raised concerns among some.\n\nThe decision to give Trump a platform for his policy messaging ahead of the November elections was seen as an affront to Black women journalists and Black people in general considering Trump's public record of pointed attacks at Black members of the press.\n\nTia Mitchell, the Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and member of the NABJ's Political Task Force, defended the inclusion of Trump via X after the organization received heavy pushback.\n\n\"I helped make this call. And it's in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades, Mitchell wrote in response to one user decrying the Trump session. \"But continue to go off on your feed. I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\"\n\nMitchell has since made her X account private after a deluge of comments under her reply.\n\nThe issue has developed into a public relations disaster for the association, but NABJ President Ken Lemon did clear up any confusion surrounding chatter that Vice President Kamala Harris was not invited.\n\nYes we did ask both candidates.

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 p.m. CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run. Some group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The decision to invite Trump, who will be interviewed in Chicago on Wednesday by Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News, and Harris Faulkner of Fox News, has created a rift among NABJ members and raised questions about the association's role and priorities.\n\nNABJ's tradition of inviting presidential candidates to address its summer convention during election years is intended to offer its members an opportunity to engage with key figures in the political landscape.However, Trump's acceptance of the invitation has provoked a significant backlash, leading to the resignation of high-profile members and a heated debate about the organization's values and objectives.\n\nTrump's relationship with NABJ has been fraught with tension. The former president has a history of disparaging Black journalists, including Yamiche Alcindor of NBC News, Abby Phillip of CNN, and April Ryan of The Grio. In 2018, NABJ condemned Trump's derogatory comments about these journalists, with then-President Sarah Glover calling his remarks \"appalling, irresponsible, and should be denounced.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's planned appearance, Karen Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, resigned as a co-chair of the 2024 NABJ convention. Attiah expressed her dissatisfaction on social media, stating that she was not consulted about the decision to include Trump and criticized the move as undermining the organization's mission. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" Attiah wrote.\n\nThe invitation has also sparked debate about whether hosting Trump might lend him undue credibility or be interpreted as an endorsement. NABJ President Ken Lemon has defended the decision, asserting that the event is not an endorsement but an opportunity to hold a significant figure accountable. \"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case, this is an important hour.\"\n\nCritics within the organization argue that allowing Trump to speak at the convention could compromise the space NABJ has cultivated as a supportive and safe environment for Black journalists. Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member, expressed concerns in The TRiiBE, writing, \"NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some industry leaders and NABJ members believe that engaging with presidential candidates, even controversial ones, is a crucial part of journalism's role in holding powerful figures accountable. Rana Cash, executive editor of the Charlotte Observer, defended the decision, stating, \"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous.\"\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He also called New York Times reporter April Ryan \"a loser.\"\n\n\"Sometimes there is no two sides. There's the truth and there's lies,\" said Maudelyn Ihejirika, a retired columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a former president of NABJ Chicago.\n\nIhejirika called Trump's invite a shock to the system.\n\n\"He draws a white supremist audience and following, and this is the type of following that inviting him could infiltrate, be welcomed by this particular candidate to a Black journalist convention,\" Ihejirika said.\n\nInfluential journalists posted some blunt takes on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"I would like to unwelcome @NABJ for surprising Chicago with this Trump news, a man who has threatened Chicago with state violence in his stump speeches -- and attracts a white supremacist following to a Black affinity space,\" wrote Morgan Elise Johnson of The Tribe.\n\nFrom April Ryan: \"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact. To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025. I object to this NABJ session with Donald Trump in Chicago.\"\n\nOne of the convention co-chairs, Karen Attiah, even announced Tuesday she was stepping down.\n\nHowever, many see value in Trump's appearance at the convention.\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon posted: \"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nAhead of the former president's visit, city officials are stepping up security.\n\n\"We're going to be prepared as a city if he decides to actually arrive in Chicago, to make sure that the nastiness and the iniquitousness formation that he brings that that doesn't stain the soul of Chicago,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said.\n\nOn the eve of Trump's visit, his campaign distanced itself from Project 2025, a Heritage Foundation document laying out plans for the next conservative administration.\n\nSaid the campaign, \"Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign -- it will not end well for you.\"\n\nChicago organizers have announced a protest against Trump outside the NABJ convention. In 2016, demonstrators forced him to cancel a rally at the University of Illinois Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile on the Democratic side, likely nominee Kamala Harris so far has not accepted an invitation to address NABJ. She is, however, reportedly close to naming a running mate.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Harris and her pick for vice president will hit the campaign trail next week.", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com",

The campaign said it will \"concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon wrote on social media, \"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nBy Tuesday morning, the conference's co-chair, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, announced on X that she was stepping down from her role.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote.\n\nSome NABJ members and members of the media say Trump's treatment towards Black reporters during his presidential term should disqualify him from participating. Others are upset about the timing of the announcement -- two days before the five-day convention began, and as many members were already traveling to Chicago for the event.\n\nInvestigative journalist Taylor Moore wrote on X, \"Really cynical for someone to say 'no one is forcing you to go' when the announcement was made two days before the convention....Feeling really bad for all the journalists flying in who didn't consent to PAY to be in the same room as him.\"\n\nMorgan Elise Johnson, co-founder of the Triibe, wrote, \"I would like to unwelcome @NABJ for surprising Chicago with this Trump news, a man who has threatened Chicago with state violence in his stump speeches--and attracts a white supremacist following to a Black affinity space.\"\n\nThe event will be moderated by Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News, Harris Faulkner of FOX News and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor. Goba interviewed Trump earlier this year, and Faulkner sat down with Trump earlier this month.\n\nIn a statement, Semafor defended Goba's participation: \"As a politics reporter, Kadia has conducted tough, fair interviews with high-ranking figures across the political spectrum, including the former president. We look forward to hearing his answers tomorrow.\"\n\nOthers also defended the event, including Symone Sanders-Townsend, former senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Some of the best journalists in the country are members of NABJ. So, why wouldn't they interview Trump? He is the Republican nominee,\" Sanders-Townsend wrote on X. \"Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions.\"\n\nThe association routinely invites candidates of both parties during election years. Vice President Kamala Harris was invited after it became clear she would likely become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, Lemon said. There was no indication yet that Harris would accept the invitation.\n\nSpeaking on WBEZ's \"Reset\" with Sasha-Ann Simons, WBEZ's race, class and communities editor Natalie Moore called Trump's appearance a \"surprise.\"\n\n\"I know it was a shock for me and then immediately -- what does this mean for the organization?\" Moore said. \"What does it mean for the members for him to come?\"\n\nMoore also questioned how the Trump footage might be used for his campaign, and why reporters from Black-owned media weren't asked to participate.\n\n\"I think that members want some answers from NABJ leadership,\" Moore said. \"Yes, we know the invite went out, but how did this panel come about? And again, my question is, were there any negotiations with Trump?\"\n\nAlso on WBEZ, Tiffany Walden, another co-founder of The Triibe, said, \"the city itself has ran Trump out of the city in 2016.\" Trump canceled a Chicago rally during his campaign in 2016 after scuffles broke out in the UIC Pavilion. In 2019, Trump came to Chicago for his first presidential visit and disparaged the city, calling it \"embarrassing to us as a nation,\" at a police conference. Later, he was met by thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower during a fundraiser he hosted.\n\n\"It's very clear that he is not a person that is welcome here. So as Black journalists, to be the organization to roll out the red carpet... It's a different situation. I know that they invited presidential candidates before, including Republicans, but in this case, Trump is not a Republican,\" Walden said. \"He's not the average candidate. He's spewing harmful misinformation, disinformation and dog whistles about Black communities -- about some of the people that will be in that room.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Chicago Police Department graduation ceremony on Tuesday, Mayor Brandon Johnson also criticized Trump's visit and his previous behavior towards Black journalists. The mayor said the city, however, will be prepared for his visit.\n\n\"....The Black press has played an integral role in the transformation of our city here in Chicago but as well as our country and our world,\" Johnson said. \"We're gonna be prepared as a city if he decides to actually arrive in Chicago to make sure that the nastiness and the ... formation that he brings doesn't stain the soul of Chicago.\"\n\nThe Sun-Times contacted several NABJ members.

Michigan Ave. The annual event gives space for Black journalists from across the nation to network, convene and learn at themed panel discussions.\n\nNABJ leaders emailed members Monday evening to announce a Q&A event with Trump scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The Republican presidential candidate will answer questions about \"the most pressing issues facing the Black community,\" according to the announcement.\n\nRachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, anchor of The Faulkner Focus and co-host of Outnumbered on FOX News; and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor, will moderate the discussion. Local publications were noticeably excluded from the bill.\n\nNational and local reporters blasted the decision on social media and questioned the timing of the announcement so close to the convention's start. A convention dedicated to uplifting Black media members will now potentially draw a national crowd and protestors in an already jam-packed weekend in the city while spotlighting a figure who helped coin the phrase \"fake news,\" they said.\n\nThe convention's theme this year is \"Winds of Change: Journalism Over Disinformation.\"\n\nNABJ leaders defended the decision, saying they typically invite presidential nominees from both major parties in an election year. Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris was invited, but reporter April Ryan reported Wednesday that NABJ leaders denied Harris' request for a virtual fireside chat during the convention.\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Attiah resigned as co-chair of the 2024 convention Tuesday morning following the announcement.\n\n\"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" Attiah tweeted.\n\nTrump \"disparages Black journalists and works to discredit the work that journalists do every day,\" said Morgan Elise Johnson, co-founder and publisher of The TRiiBe, a digital publication reshaping the narrative of Black Chicago.\n\nRyan, the White House Correspondent and recipient of NABJ's 2017 \"Journalist of the Year\" award who reported on Harris' not attending the convention, shared a video of Trump attacking Black journalists on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n\"Leaders like Donald Trump who continuously show that they don't value the press, I just don't know why he got such an open invitation to come to this,\" Johnson said. \"That just shows how misaligned the leadership is with its members, and how they've made this decision that makes members feel unsafe.\"\n\nNABJ previously called out Trump for disrespecting Black, female journalists, demanding the then-president \"stop his verbal assault\" on reporters.\n\nTrump has also caused damage to Black queer and trans people -- \"including those who are journalists and members of NABJ,\" said Femi Redwood, chair of NABJ's LGBTQ+ Task Force. The task force \"was not invited into conversations about hosting Trump,\" Redwood said on Twitter.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that in a space where so many queer and trans members still feel vulnerable, [they] will now feel even more unsafe due to Trump being invited and the possibility of his most vicious followers coming to the hotel to support him,\" Redwood said.\n\nPeople spent hundreds of dollars to attend the convention before NABJ announced the Trump panel, Johnson said.\n\nRegistration ranges from $300 to $450 for NABJ members and $500 to $600 for non-member journalists. Any member of the press can register to attend Trump's panel for free.\n\nJournalism is in a \"crisis\" where many reporters are underpaid, Johnson said. This decision \"could feel like a slap in the face\" to the media workers who scrounged up the money to pay for travel, hotel costs and more for the event, Johnson said.\n\nSafety is another concern for members attending the convention's kick-off event, Johnson said.\n\nDonald Trump famously canceled a Chicago rally during the 2016 election when attendees and protestors clashed. Local organizers have announced they will host a protest at the convention Wednesday.\n\nLollapalooza, a music festival that welcomes hundreds of thousands of people to the city, also begins Thursday in Grant Park, across the street from the convention site.\n\n\"This is a hostile environment at a very politically hot time right before the DNC where there's a lot of movement and organizing taking place in the city,\" Johnson said. \"There was a certain lack of care and concern about safety that is disappointing because we're going to be now subject to potentially over-policing and all types of security protocols where it takes away the family and communal vibe that NABJ is supposed to be for so many people.\"\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson tweeted the city is prepared to \"uphold safety\" during Trump's appearance Wednesday.\n\n\"My administration's values and practice are in complete opposition to former President Donald Trump's agenda, but I want the people of Chicago to know that City departments and agencies are fully prepared to uphold safety during his scheduled visit on Wednesday,\" the mayor said.\n\nTrump's panel is a \"double-edged sword,\" said Josh McGee, Chicago bureau chief and investigative reporter at MindSite News. McGee will host two panels at this year's convention.\n\nIt's important to hold people in power accountable and, if done properly, the young journalists attending Trump's event will witness that work in action, McGee said. But there were also many local Black journalists who could've moderated the event, McGee said.\n\nHaving a former candidate on the convention bill is \"newsworthy\" and draws eyes to the national celebration, but it's only fair if Harris was invited, too, McGee said.\n\nNABJ leaders said they typically invite presidential nominees from both parties in an election year.\n\nGiven the focus on misinformation, the association needs someone to fact-check Trump in real-time, \"otherwise, they're not keeping the promise of what this conference is about,\" McGee said.\n\n\"This is a collection of hundreds and thousands of media people, people good at their jobs,\" McGee said. \"NABJ made a promise with their headlines to talk about disinformation. They put the panel together, now let's see how they plan it. That's what's key to me.\"\n\nLeaders at The TriiBe saw the convention as \"an opportunity to build bridges and uplift the work that we do,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson will speak on the panel \"Leading Voices In Chicago's Black Storytelling\" on Thursday. The event is free and separate from NABJ's convention schedule.\n\nJournalists planned to speak about their experiences in the field at Thursday's event. That might change now, Johnson said.\n\n\"I think now that conversation needs to be a critique of where the Black press is today and whether we're operating like the legendary press of the past,\" Johnson said. \"It'll have a much more serious tone and function as a space for people to air their grievances with identity politics, assimilations into journalism, leaders of the Black press while calling us to think about who we are going to be.\"\n\nThe Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression plans to protest Trump's visit 11:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nTrump, a frequent critic of Chicago, rarely comes to the city that overwhelmingly voted for his opponents in the past two presidential elections.\n\nHe last came to town in 2019 to speak at a conference for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, criticizing Supt. Eddie Johnson and saying \"Afghanistan is a safer place\" than Chicago. Before that, he'd not held a public event in Chicago since protesters forced him to cancel a rally in March 2016.", "source": {"uri": "blockclubchicago.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Block Club

While Harris seems to be avoiding public media opportunities (she hasn't had a sit-down interview since her \"coronation\" as the presumptive Democrat nominee), Trump is taking them head-on.\n\nTrump agreed to sit with a panel at the NABJ Annual Convention & Career Fair moderated by \"Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, anchor of The Faulkner Focus and co-host of Outnumbered on FOX News; and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor,\" NABJ announced.\n\n\"We look forward to our attendees hearing from former President Trump on the critical issues our members and their audiences care about most,\" NABJ President Ken Lemon said in a statement. \"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\" (ROOKE: Media Didn't Learn A Single Lesson From Hiding Biden)\n\nWhile the general public cannot attend, the event will be live-streamed, allowing Trump to speak freely about his plans to fix the issues in black American communities. Harris has reportedly declined to speak at the panel, making her look scared to campaign. Soon, Americans will wonder if her avoidance of panels like this means that Democrats intend to run a basement campaign with her like they did President Biden in 2020.\n\nAlthough it was successful for Biden, times have changed. There is no national campaign fearmongering over COVID-19 to blame her public absence on; she isn't a senile old man who needs to be protected. The media sells Harris as the \"savior of Democracy\" (big D). If that were true, why is the supposed tyrant (Trump) willing to go into what would be a seemingly hostile event to campaign and Harris is not? (ROOKE: Swing-State Candidate Gives Republicans Clear-Cut Plan To End Kamala's Momentum)\n\nThere's a reason she's hiding. Trump's decision to attend the NABJ Annual Convention & Career Fair exposes her. Either she doesn't think she can handle the panel and come out unscathed, or her campaign staff has no faith in her.

This has to be a joke,\" Femi Redwood, NABJ's LGBTQ+ task force chair, told CJR. She has since been fielding messages from members of the task force expressing their confusion and dismay.\n\nOn Tuesday, the reaction spread quickly. Karen Attiah, a Washington Post columnist, announced on X that she was stepping down as this year's NABJ conference co-chair. \"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" she posted.\n\nOthers took a different view. \"Some of the best journalists in the country are members of NABJ. So, why wouldn't they interview Trump.... Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" wrote Symone D. Sanders Townsend, cohost of the MSNBC show The Weekend. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did.\"\n\n\"As journalists we can never be afraid to tackle Trump,\" journalist Jemele Hill said, also on X. In a separate posting she added: \"I do think we might overestimate how much people know about what he plans to do in office.\"\n\nThese defenses of Trump's attendance missed a larger point, said Ernest Owens, a journalist and president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists. In the past, he pointed out, NABJ has been critical of Trump's treatment of Black journalists and the press and have given a \"thumbs down\" award to Fox News.\n\n\"As an advocacy organization, you don't have to act like a newsroom, you can take a stance,\" Owens told CJR. \"For them to now weaponize journalism ethics to defend this circus, as an advocacy organization that does not have to do this, is irresponsible and intellectually dishonest,\" Owens added.\n\n\"I fully understand that journalists interview vile people as part of the job but a conference is not intended to be a regular day on the job\" wrote Jen\u00e9e Desmond-Harris, a writer and editor at Slate. \"You're not there for your beat.\"\n\n\"It was always billed to me as a family reunion,\" Redwood said of the annual conference. \"It's the place you can come where you don't have to explain certain things you have to explain in a newsroom.\" She said the gathering has always strived to be a safe space for Black journalists to develop skills, meet hiring managers and expand their networks. \"The question I would ask the organization is, 'How does this align with any of those things?'\" she said.\n\nMany others voiced their discontent online. April Ryan, the Grio's White House Correspondent and an MSNBC contributor, posted, \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee.\"\n\nKeith Boykin, an author and former White House aide, shared a video to X that included moments in which Trump insulted various Black journalists. The former president can be seen calling journalist April Ryan a \"loser,\" describing Don Lemon as the \"stupidest man on television,\" and accusing Yamiche Alcindor of asking racist questions. Boykin wondered whether the panel would ask Trump about these moments -- and accused one of the journalists interviewing Trump, Fox News anchor Harris Faulkner, of being \"in the tank for Trump.\" Faulkner will moderate alongside ABC News congressional correspondent Rachel Scott and Semafor political reporter Kadia Goba.\n\nNABJ's president Ken Lemon released a statement on Monday after the announcement: \"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nOwens feels that the NABJ was merely seeking spectacle. \"There is this very messy opportunity -- one Trump, desperate to try to get in the face of Black people, and [the other] NABJ, thirsty for some level of relevance -- and so the two interests kind of, in a very weird, bizarre way, align,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cjr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Columbia Journalism Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Phillips notably called out NABJ as being \"idiotic\" in a series of social media posts.\n\n\"Y'all just made the only safe haven that Black journalists have, potentially unsafe, all because y'all want to look 'smarter than everybody else,' when this is....idiotic at best,\" Phillips posted on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThat post followed another from Phillips in which he claimed inviting Trump is \"the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history. Whoever made this call is an idiot. And I'll say it to their face this week.\"\n\nTia Mitchell, the Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the chairperson of NABJ's Political Task Force, responded to Phillips' first post by identifying herself as someone who \"helped make this call.\"\n\nMitchell went on to defend the decision to invite Trump to address Black journalists as a standing precedent that is \"in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades.\"\n\nNABJ's invitation to Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is still pending, the group said.\n\nMitchell, who also addressed other posts critical of NABJ's decision to host Trump, vowed to \"continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\"\n\nThat was likely no solace for Jim Trotter, NABJ's 2023 Journalist of the Year who called it such \"a poor decision by @NABJ that it's difficult to put into words.\"\n\nRoland Martin, a former winner of NABJ's coveted Journalist of the Year award who has been active within the organization for years, called out the organization for not choosing a Black male journalist to help moderate the event; what with the myriad reports suggesting Trump has made notable inroads with Black male voters.\n\nIt also can't be ignored that NABJ decided against any Black-owned and operated media participating in the event.\n\nAn email seeking comment from NABJ was not immediately returned.\n\nAdding to the outrage was NABJ President Ken Lemon's statement that predicted Trump -- a proven and habitual unabashed liar -- \"will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nMitchell and Lemon were not alone in their defense of NABJ.\n\nJemele Hill, NABJ's 2018 Journalist of the Year, suggested she understood NABJ's invitation to Trump - with whom she clashed in 2017 about the topic of white supremacy - and said she's \"not mad about him being there. If there is any room I'd want to see how he operates in, it's in the company of 3,000 Black journalists.\"\n\nHill suggested there could be a reaction similar to when NABJ hosted then-Trump aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman at its convention in New Orleans in 2017.\n\nThat was when several activists and journalists turned their backs on Manigault-Newman as she spoke during a panel discussion moderated by journalist Ed Gordon. The panel ended when Manigault-Newman walked off of the stage as then-NABJ President Sarah Glover explained why she was invited to speak.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign has already seized on the opportunity of the optics of him being surrounded by Black professionals by boasting about the NABJ invitation in a late-night email on Monday that was -- surprise! -- replete with lies.\n\n\"President Trump accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history,\" a campaign press release says in part without substantiating such a claim with any quantifiable data. Instead, the press release goes on to state without proof that \"Black voters know that President Trump is the only presidential candidate who can deliver results on day one because he already has, including landmark unemployment rates for Black Americans, increased median income for Black households, historic permanent funding for HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), comprehensive bipartisan criminal justice reform, and nearly $50 billion in funds to revitalize Opportunity Zones.\"\n\n(To be sure, President Joe Biden has delivered the lowest Black unemployment rate on record; the Associated Press reported that \"Trump is exaggerating economic gains for African Americans during his administration;\" records show that Trump never requested increased funding for HBCUs during his presidency; the so-called First Step Act criminal justice reform bill signed by Trump \"never produced the spike in support from Black voters that he expected,\" Politico reported; and Trump's 2017 tax plan that created Opportunity Zones -- efforts meant to revitalize urban neighborhoods -- never achieved the desired economic growth in low-income communities and were exploited by investors, PBS reported.)\n\nBut as Trump has repeatedly demonstrated, facts don't matter when it comes to his rhetoric, which is in direct conflict with the foundation of journalism and its mission to report the truth.\n\nConsidering that coming collision of circumstances in Chicago, something's likely got to give on Wednesday.\n\nWhite Editor Goes Viral For Twitter Thread About Media Racism Black Journalists Face\n\nBlack Journalists Association Says CBS Must Change 'Toxic Culture'\n\nA Timeline Of Trump's Unprovoked Attacks On Black Women 12 photos", "source": {"uri": "newsone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News One"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_c_t_wright@newsone.com", "name": "Bruce C.T.

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris' schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.\n\n\"The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,\" the person said. \"The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\n\"Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,\" the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. \"The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Mainstream media keeps trying to convince us that he actually is gaining support among Black people. Let's see if it's true.\"\n\nNABJ invitations to candidates are not new. In 2004, both George W.

In 2007, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton addressed the convention.\n\nVice President Harris was also invited to speak this year; her response is pending, according to the organization.\n\nTrump, who is hoping to win 20 percent of Black voter support this election, has already made several campaign stops in predominantly Black communities this cycle. He is now leaning into Wednesday's event.\n\nIn a press release announcing the event, Trump's campaign said he has \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history by implementing America First policies on the economy, immigration, energy, law and order, and foreign policy.\"\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Trump's campaign.\n\nTia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said she helped make the call to invite Trump.\n\n\"I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next president,\" Mitchell added.\n\nBut Arionne Nettles, author of \"We are the Culture: Black Chicago's Influence on Everything,\" pointed out on X that not a single Black media organization is represented in the panel of moderators for the event. Instead, the conversation will be moderated by ABC's Rachel Scott, FOX News's Harris Faulkner and Semafor's Kadia Gibbs.\n\n\"Not even any Black orgs? On top of everything.

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris' schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.\n\n\"The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,\" the person said. \"The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\n\"Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,\" the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. \"The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nAlso Read | US Presidential Elections 2024: Donald Trump is the Biggest Threat to Health, Welfare and Social Security Programmes, Says Kamala Harris Campaign.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 pm CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organisation turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nAlso Read | Food Poisoning in Japan: 1 Die, Over 140 Sick After Eating Grilled Eel.\n\nThe debate over NABJ's invite reflects how many journalists are still grappling with how to approach Trump nearly a decade after his first presidential run.\n\nSome group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labelling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organisation's constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.

The former president will discuss issues facing the Black community through questions from ABC News, FOX News and Semafor journalists.\n\nThe announcement quickly prompted backlash from some Black journalists who said they were \"disgusted\" and expressed concerns over Trump's rhetoric toward Black people.\n\nOrganizers with the Black Voters Matter Fund, a voting rights advocacy group founded in 2016 amid Trump's ascent, called the decision \"unacceptable\" in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a slap in the face to every Black journalist and the communities we serve,\" the post read.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington Post columnist and global opinions editor Karen Attiah said Tuesday on X that she was stepping down from her position as co-chair of the convention. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she added in a follow-up post.\n\nAttiah did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.\n\nLeaders in the organization defended the decision to host the Republican presidential nominee. NABJ President Ken Lemon said on social media that the organization invites the presidential nominees from both major parties every election year, and added that it had invited presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris cited logistical reasons -- including attending the funeral for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and choosing a running mate -- for why she would not be able to the attend the convention this year, according to a source familiar with her plans. The source added that NABJ turned down Harris' offer of a virtual discussion or holding one at a later date.\n\nBoth George W. Bush and John Kerry spoke at the NABJ's 2004 convention, and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did so in 2007, according to The Hill. Clinton returned for a speech and news conference in 2016. President Joe Biden spoke at the virtual conference held in 2020; Trump did not.\n\nTia Mitchell, co-chair of the convention, echoed Lemon's explanation and said she had helped organize the Q&A \"to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President.\"\n\nCritics said these explanations did not adequately address concerns from journalists and other NABJ members who balked at giving Trump such a high-profile platform at the convention, given his history, in their view, of emboldening white supremacists, racist rhetoric and laying the groundwork for education restrictions, anti-DEI legislation and anti-LGBTQ laws.\n\nVeteran White House correspondent April Ryan, the 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote in a post Tuesday on X that she objected to Trump's appearance in Chicago.\n\n\"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025.\"\n\nThe Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, a justice organization, announced in an Instagram post that it would protest Trump's Chicago visit in a rally on Wednesday.\n\nThe event comes as Trump works to ramp up support among Black voters and polls suggest younger Black voters are showing more openness to him as a candidate. As a result, some critics suggested Trump only accepted the NABJ's invitation to lure Black voters. Trump's team also announced the event on his website, writing that Trump has \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Jackson Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

However, many of the organization's members and some of the nation's top Black journalists immediately became enraged to learn about the move.\n\nOne member, Pulitzer Prize nominee Carron J. Phillips, slammed the group on X (formerly Twitter), writing, \"When membership numbers and those dues fall off a cliff, remember the day y'all made this dumb a** decision.\" He also tweeted and said, \"This is the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history. Whoever made this call is an idiot. And I'll say it to their face this week.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Phillips added, \"Y'all just made the only safe haven that Black journalists have, potentially unsafe, all because y'all want to look 'smarter than everybody else,' when this is.... idiotic at best.\" Phillips continued to blast the NABJ and its organizers who invited Donald Trump to this week's event. However, while slamming the organization, Phillips also retweeted others, who eventually revealed that each election year the NABJ invites all candidates. It just so happens that this year, Trump accepted the invite for the Republicans, which some users claimed is unheard of.\n\nRELATED: Post And Delete: Forbes 'DEI Expert' Poses Controversial Question: 'Will Surviving Gunfire Be Donald Trump's Next Appeal To Black Voters?'\n\nMeanwhile, other users online wanted to know if Donald Trump was invited to represent the Republicans, was Vice President Kamala Harris offered the same invitation as the presumptive Democratic nominee in the 2024 presidential race. It turns out that she was invited, but it was later revealed that VP Harris reportedly will not be attending the NABJ Convention in Chicago this week.\n\nApril D. Ryan, who is the White House Correspondent for TheGrio and 2017 NABJ \"Journalist of the Year,\" made the announcement and said, \"A source familiar also says Harris is hitting the ground running as the new presumptive Democratic Nominee days into her campaign working through all of the necessary planning and attending the funeral of late Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. The source also says the Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option. The NABJ team, unfortunately, denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in-person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\nIn the midst of all of the hoopla, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah spoke out and announced that she was stepping down as co-chair of this year's convention with Donald Trump. Taking to X, Attiah said, \"I have decided to step down as co-chair from this year's #NABJ24 convention in Chicago. To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck. For everyone else, I'm looking forward to meeting and reconnecting with all of you in the Windy City. #NABJ.\" In a second tweet, she continued to clarify her move, stating, \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nRELATED: Omarosa Slams Donald Trump Over 'Black Jobs' Debate Comments, Compares Remarks To 'Slavery'\n\n#Socialites, be sure to check out the post below, then leave us your thoughts in a comment after!", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodunlocked.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Unlocked"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ariela_anis@hollywoodunlocked.com", "name": "Ariela An\u00eds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulitzer Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Jackson Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Correspondents' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireside chats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://hollywoodunlocked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Several-Members-Of-The-National-Association-Of-Black-Journalists-Outraged-And-Canceling-Memberships-After-NABJ-Invites-Donald-Trump-To-Convention-In-Chicago-Co-Chair-Steps-Down.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774346", "eventUri": "eng-9774346", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 840, "textEnd": 847}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The source was granted anonymity to discuss private discussions between Harris's campaign team and NABJ.\n\nThe source told theGrio that Harris is unable to attend the convention, which begins July 31 and ends Aug. 4, due to planning and travels during the first days of the presumptive Democratic nominee's nascent presidential campaign. Harris is also traveling to Houston to attend the funeral service of late U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.\n\nThe source also told theGrio that Harris's campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option. The NABJ team, according to the source, denied a request for the vice president to take part in a fireside chat virtually or schedule an in-person one with Harris at a later date.\n\nWhen asked during the White House daily briefing on Tuesday about whether Harris or President Joe Biden, who traveled to Austin on Monday to commemorate the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would attend the convention in Chicago, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told theGrio, \"The NABJ makes their own decision on guests.\"\n\nThe Biden spokesperson referred other questions related to Biden and Harris and the NABJ convention to the vice president's campaign.\n\nThe news that Harris will not attend the convention came as NABJ is marred by controversy. The organization announced it is hosting a town hall on Wednesday with former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Three Black female journalists -- Fox News host Harris Faulkner, ABC reporter Rachel Scott, and Semafor reporter Kadia Goba -- will moderate the conversation.\n\nCritics of NABJ's decision to host Trump point out that, as president, he attacked a number of Black journalists and undermined the free press. The former president notably popularized the term \"Fake News\" when disparaging news coverage he did not agree with.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon defended the decision to facilitate the Q&A with Trump. He explained that the non-partisan invitation is a years-long tradition and that it was not an endorsement of Trump.\n\n\"We invited both [Trump and Harris]. We got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said in video remarks posted on NABJ's official X page.\n\nLemon also shared that the organization is working to ensure Trump, known for telling falsehoods, is fact-checked during the conversation.\n\nSince the news of Trump's visit broke on Monday, backlash has ensued, including the resignation of the convention's co-chair, Karen Attiah.\n\n\"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she wrote on X.\n\nThe National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA) on Tuesday called for NABJ to rescind the Trump invitation. The organization posted an altered version of the event's digital graphic with the word \"Condemned.\"\n\nA protest is scheduled for Wednesday morning just before Trump's appearance at the NABJ convention at the Hilton Chicago. According to the Chicago-based digital news site The Triibe, the \"Trump is not welcome in Chicago\" demonstration is organized by Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR), Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)-Chicago, and US Palestinian Community Network.\n\nAs for Vice President Harris, three sources with direct knowledge about NABJ's planning related to her now-scrapped appearance told theGrio that, similar to Wednesday's talk with Trump, a panel of respected journalists was on standby to conduct the conversation.\n\nDuring Tuesday's press briefing, Jean-Pierre said the Biden-Harris administration has \"always been ... very direct and very focused on speaking to both local and national Black-owned outlets.\"\n\n\"We understand the importance of Black Americans [hearing] directly from this administration,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "april_ryan@thegrio.com",

The stunning invitation has sparked widespread outrage within the journalism community.\n\n\"I strongly oppose Trump's participation in the NABJ annual convention and career fair,\" declared NNPA National Chair Bobby Henry. The NNPA represents over 250 African-American-owned newspapers and media companies and has been a pillar of the Black Press of America for 197 years. \"His divisive rhetoric and actions have harmed marginalized communities, particularly the Black community,\" Henry continued. \"Allowing him a platform at this event undermines the NABJ's values of inclusion and solidarity and risks normalizing his damaging behavior.\"\n\nHenry emphasized the necessity of Black journalists to foster dialogues that uplift and empower marginalized voices, not those who have historically opposed minority interests.\n\nFounded in 1975, the NABJ is a prominent organization for journalists of color in America. The decision to invite the controversial, twice-impeached, and 34-times convicted felon and former president has triggered a significant backlash from its members.\n\n\"I have decided to step down as co-chair from this year's #NABJ24 convention in Chicago,\" tweeted NABJ convention co-chair Karen Attiah to her 234,000 followers. \"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck. For everyone else, I'm looking forward to meeting and reconnecting with all of you in the Windy City.\" Attiah noted that NABJ leadership did not consult her in the decision to provide Trump with a platform.\n\nJournalist Kathia Woods, who will host a panel during the event, voiced her disappointment but affirmed her commitment to attending the convention due to her responsibilities. \"I'm here for my young journalists to support and will continue to advocate for you,\" Woods stated. \"Also, Brandon is a friend, and he and his team worked really hard.\"\n\nProminent journalists April Ryan and Yamiche Alcindor, both of whom Trump has previously targeted, also condemned the NABJ's decision. However, Jemele Hill and Simone Sanders argued that the criticism might be premature. \"We interviewed the President of the Heritage Foundation on @TheWeekendMSNBC,\" Sanders wrote.\n\n\"Some people thought it was a bad idea, but we asked real questions and got him on the record on key issues. Folks shouldn't assume that all the journalists interviewing Trump at NABJ aren't going to ask real questions or hold him accountable.\"\n\nRoland Martin, another prominent NABJ member, added that he found it troubling that no Black male journalists were invited to question Trump. Like so many others, Martin vehemently objected to including Fox News personality and Trump apologist Harris Faulkner, who will serve as moderator.\n\nAs the backlash grows, NABJ President Ken Lemon faces increasing calls for his resignation. \"The NNPA is resolutely opposed to Donald Trump being scheduled to speak at the 2024 NABJ national convention in Chicago,\" stated NNPA President and CEO Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr.\n\n\"For 197 years, the Black Press of America has been on the frontline of Black America's struggle for freedom, justice, and equality. It is a tragic affront to Black America for NABJ to permit Trump to spew racist lies, hatred, and fascism at an NABJ national convention. The NNPA urgently calls upon NABJ leadership to immediately rescind the invitation. The eyes of Black America and the world are watching with shame and disgust.\"", "source": {"uri": "spokesman-recorder.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Newspaper_Publishers_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Newspaper Publishers Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamiche_Alcindor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yamiche Alcindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jemele Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "April Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Martin_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roland Martin (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://spokesman-recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NABJ-Trump.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774346", "eventUri": "eng-9774346", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The former president will discuss issues facing the black community through questions posed by reporters from ABC News, FOX News and Semafor.\n\nThe announcement quickly drew a backlash from some black journalists who said they were disgusted and concerned by Trump's rhetoric toward black people.\n\nOrganizers of the Black Voters Matter Fund, a voting rights group founded in 2016 amid Trump's rise, called the decision unacceptable in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\nThis is a slap in the face to every black journalist and to the communities we serve, the message read.\n\nMeanwhile, Karen Attiah, a Washington Post columnist and global opinion editor, said on X on Tuesday that she was stepping down as convention co-chair. While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted in any way in the decision to present Trump in this format, she added in a separate message.\n\nAttiah did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe organization's leaders defended the decision to host the Republican presidential nominee. NABJ President Ken Lemon said on social media that the organization invites presidential candidates from both major parties every election year, and added that it had invited presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with her plans, Harris cited logistical reasons, including attending Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's funeral and choosing a running mate, as reasons for her inability to attend the convention this year. The source added that NABJ declined Harris' offer to host a virtual discussion or to hold one later.\n\nAccording to The Hill, George W. Bush and John Kerry both spoke at the NABJ convention in 2004, and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did so in 2007. Clinton returned for a speech and press conference in 2016. Joe Biden spoke at the virtual conference in 2020; Trump did not.\n\nTia Mitchell, the convention's co-chair, echoed Lemons' explanation and said she helped organize the question-and-answer session to create opportunities for reporters to interview the potential next president.\n\nCritics said those explanations did not adequately address the concerns of journalists and other NABJ members who were hesitant to give Trump such a prominent platform at the convention, given his history, they said, of emboldening white supremacists, pushing racist rhetoric and preparing for education restrictions, anti-DEI legislation and anti-LGBTQ laws.\n\nApril Ryan, a veteran White House correspondent and the 2017 NABJ Journalist of the Year, wrote in an article published Tuesday on X that she opposed Trump's presence in Chicago.\n\nHaving an allegedly orchestrated sit-down with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the black women journalists (NABJ Journalists of the Year) who have had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential candidate who is pushing an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and its democracy with his 2025 agenda.\n\nThe Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, a justice organization, announced in an Instagram post that it would protest Trump's visit to Chicago at a rally on Wednesday.\n\nThe event comes as Trump is working to build support among black voters, and polls suggest that younger black voters are more open to his candidacy. As a result, some critics have suggested that Trump accepted the NABJ invitation only to appeal to black voters.

The campaign said it would focus on the most pressing issues facing the black community.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will not attend the convention for logistical reasons, including selecting her running mate, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\n\nNABJ President Ken Lemon posted on social media: \"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members and welcome the opportunity to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers that Black Americans want and need to know.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the conference's co-chair, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, announced on X that she was stepping down.\n\nTo the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them good luck, Attiah wrote.\n\nSome NABJ members and media outlets believe Trump's treatment of black journalists during his presidency should prevent him from attending. Others are upset about the timing of the announcement two days before the five-day convention begins, when many members were already en route to Chicago for the event.\n\nMorgan Elise Johnson, co-founder of Triibe, wrote: \"I want to salute @NABJ for surprising Chicago with this news about Trump, a man who has threatened Chicago with state violence in his campaign speeches - and who is attracting a white supremacist audience to a Black affinity space.\"\n\nThe event will be hosted by Rachel Scott, ABC News' senior congressional correspondent, Fox News' Harris Faulkner and Kadia Goba, a political reporter at Semafor. Goba interviewed Trump this year and Faulkner spoke with Trump this month.\n\nIn a statement, Semafor defended Goba's participation: \"As a political journalist, Kadia has conducted tough and fair interviews with high-ranking figures from across the political spectrum, including the former president. We look forward to his responses tomorrow.\"\n\nOthers also defended the event, including Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former senior adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSome of the best journalists in the country are members of NABJ. So why wouldn't they interview Trump? He's the Republican nominee, Sanders-Townsend wrote on X. It seems like the complaining journalists don't understand that their job is to ask the questions.\n\nThe association regularly invites candidates from both parties during election years. Harris was invited after it became clear she would likely become the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Lemon said.\n\nBut according to a source familiar with the discussions, Harris will not attend because it was not logistically feasible. Harris' campaign worked with NABJ leaders to find an alternative option, including a virtual fireside chat or a later in-person event, but their requests were denied, the source said.\n\nBefore withdrawing from the race, President Joe Biden had confirmed his attendance at the conference.\n\nSpeaking on WBEZ's Reset with Sasha-Ann Simons, WBEZ's race, class and community editor Natalie Moore called Trump's appearance a surprise.\n\nI know it was a shock to me, but what does it mean for the organization? Moore said. What does it mean for the members that he's here?\n\nMoore also questioned how Trump's footage could be used for his campaign and why journalists from Black-owned media outlets were not invited to participate.\n\n\"I think members want answers from NABJ leadership,\" Moore said. \"Yes, we know the invitation was extended, but how was this panel created? And again, my question is, were there negotiations with Trump?\n\nTriibe co-founder Tiffany Walden also told WBEZ: \"The city itself ran Trump out of town in 2016. Trump canceled a rally in Chicago during his 2016 campaign after scuffles broke out at the UIC pavilion. In 2019, Trump came to Chicago for his first presidential visit and disparaged the city, calling it an embarrassment to us as a nation, at a police conference. Later, he was greeted by thousands of protesters outside Trump Tower at a fundraiser he hosted.\"\n\n\"It's clear that he's not welcome here. As black journalists, we have to be the organization that rolls out the red carpet... This is a different situation. I know they've invited presidential candidates before, including Republicans, but in this case, Trump is not a Republican,\" Walden said. \"He's not your average candidate. He's spreading harmful misinformation, disinformation and dog whistles about black communities and some of the people who are going to be in this room.\"\n\nAt a Chicago Police Department graduation ceremony Tuesday, Mayor Brandon Johnson also criticized Trump's visit and his past behavior toward black journalists. The mayor, however, said the city would be prepared for his visit.\n\n\"The black press has played a vital role in transforming our city, here in Chicago, but also our country and our world,\" Johnson said. \"We're going to prepare ourselves as a city if he decides to come to Chicago to make sure that the wickedness and the education that he brings doesn't taint the soul of Chicago.\"\n\nThe Sun-Times reached out to several NABJ members. None would comment. Representatives for ABC and Fox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs for Chicago, the city has been Trump's favorite scapegoat since his 2016 campaign. He continued his frequent attacks while in the White House, often without regard to whether crime in Chicago was up or down.\n\nHe has spoken frequently about deploying the military, telling a Fox News host in 2020: \"We're going to have to do something about crime in Chicago.\"\n\nAnd in listing the city's crime statistics at a White House event that year, President Trump said, \"It's worse than Afghanistan.\" I hate to say it: It's worse than any war zone we've ever been in, by a long shot. It makes places seem peaceful by comparison. So we're not going to let that continue.\n\nContribution by Mary Norkol\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris' schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.\n\n\"The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,\" the person said. \"The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\n\"Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,\" the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. \"The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah even stepped down as co-chair of the convention after the move.\n\nTrump is expected on opening day to participate in a \"special conversation\" with moderators Harris Faulkner of Fox News, ABC News' Rachel Scott and Semafor's Kadia Goba.\n\nSome members of the organization are outraged over the decision, we're told, and some are so disgusted they've even canceled their plans to attend.\n\nIt's become a hot topic on social media with several prominent journos and longtime members of the association saying they're frustrated with the NABJ's decision to provide a platform for the former president.\n\nNABJ's 2023 Journalist of the Year recipient, Jim Trotter, was so upset by the \"poor decision\" that he said \"it's difficult to put into words.\"\n\nPulitzer Prize nominee and past NABJ award winner Carron J. Phillips wrote on X, \"This is the single dumbest and worst decision in NABJ history. Whoever made this call is an idiot. And I'll say it to their face this week.\"\n\nTia Mitchell of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution responded to Phillips, revealing that she was a part of the decision to host Trump.\n\n\"I helped make this call. And it's in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades. But continue to go off on your feed. I'll continue to work to create opportunities for journalists to interview the potential next President,\" she shot back.\n\nAttiah, on the other hand, made it clear she had no say in the plan when she announced she's stepping down as co-chair on Tuesday.\n\n\"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she wrote.\n\nThe Atlantic's Jemele Hill wrote: \"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump... Mainstream media keeps trying to convince us that he actually is gaining support among Black people. Let's see if it's true.\"\n\nOthers pointed out that Trump has consistently insulted black journalists like CNN's Abby Phillips, Don Lemon, Yamiche Alcindor and White House vet April D. Ryan, who was NABJ's 2017 Journalist of the Year recipient.\n\nRyan, too, objects to Trump's NABJ visit. \"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" she wrote.\n\n\"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of the Republican presidential nominee...

It will be livestreamed and open to convention attendees but not open to the general public.\n\nTrump has said he wants to court Black voters for the November election, particularly with his economic policies.

The party is expected to celebrate the historic presidential nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris, who would be the first Black woman to lead a presidential ticket.\n\nThe NABJ also invited Harris to participate in the convention and \"her confirmation is pending,\" the organization said in a statement late Monday. Other former chief executives, including former President Barack Obama, have participated in NABJ conventions either as presidents or candidates, the statement noted.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It will be held on noon on Wednesday.\n\n\"Black voters know that President Trump is the only presidential candidate who can deliver results on day one because he already has,\" the Trump campaign said in the statement.\n\nThe Q&A will be moderated by Rachel Scott of ABC News, Harris Faulkner of Fox News and Kadia Goba of the digital publication Semafor. It will be livestreamed and open to convention attendees but not open to the general public.\n\nTrump has said he wants to court Black voters for the November election, particularly with his economic policies. But his campaign agenda also has called for expanding police practices such as stop and frisk that have disproportionately affected Black Americans.\n\nDuring Trump's first visit to Chicago as president in 2019, he was met by hundreds of protesters and lobbed criticism at the city's then-police superintendent and other city leaders.\n\nAs a candidate for president in 2016, Trump was forced to cancel a rally at the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion amid security concerns as thousands of protesters demonstrated in the area.\n\nReaction on social media immediately after the NABJ's announcement was mixed.\n\n\"This is such a poor decision by @NABJ that it's difficult to put into words,\" Jim Trotter, a sports journalist and NABJ's 2023 Journalist of the Year, wrote on X.\n\n\"[L]ike many people said, this is where you go to get away from the hostility of your newsroom.

No one is forcing them to attend. But there is precedent of such invitations and great care taken with this particular one,\" Mitchell wrote.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to

But on Tuesday night -- a night after the announcement that Trump would be appearing -- NABJ President Ken Lemon reiterated that the invitation to Trump was not an endorsement.\n\nIt was something extended to both Trump and presumed Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nStill, despite the invitation of presidential candidates to the convention being a tradition that goes back decades, it has divided many within the organization with Trump involved.\n\nA fiery debate ensued online between members of the organization when the Trump campaign announced plans to attend the convention.\n\nSome journalists welcomed the idea of grilling the former president.\n\n\"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump. The reality is that he is running for president and needs to be treated as such. Being questioned by journalists is part of the job, and especially important in the company of Black journalists,\" Jemele Hill, a contributing writer for The Atlantic, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"Mainstream media keeps trying to convince us that he actually is gaining support among Black people. Let's see if it's true.\"\n\nOthers pushed back, flooding social media with frustration about the decision.\n\n\"This is platforming a tyrant. Nothing more, nothing less,\" wrote communications strategist Queen Muse.\n\nThe decision even led the co-chair for the convention, Karen Attiah, to step down.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote. \"For everyone else, I'm looking forward to meeting and reconnecting with all of you in the Windy City.\"\n\nJournalist and NABJ member April Ryan, White House correspondent for The Grio, called the Trump invitation \"a slap in the face to Black women journalists.\" On X, she shared a highlight reel of her contentious run-ins with Trump over the years.\n\nAva Thompson Greenwell is a journalism professor at Northwestern University, who is also a member of NABJ.\n\n\"I can understand how she feels disrespected,\" Greenwell said of Ryan. \"But I think in the end, it's really important for us as journalists not to be partisan.\"\n\nGreenwell also sees the controversial panel conversation with Trump as an opportunity.\n\n\"We need to the journalists to hold his feet to the fire, and to ask those difficult questions,\" she said. \"so that's what I'm going to be looking for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe sentiment was shared by NABJ President Lemon, who said panelists will be factchecking as the former presidents speaks.\n\n\"We have people whose lives are depending on what happens in November,\" Lemon said. \"For us as journalists -- people who go into and have very uncomfortable conversations for the sake of our members -- this is an important time.\"\n\nWhile Vice President Harris has yet to confirm whether she will be in attendance for the five-day conference, a source within the organization told CBS News Chicago they are close to finalizing a possible virtual speaking engagement with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nMeanwhile, with Trump scheduled to take the stage at noon Wednesday at the Chicago Hilton and Towers, at least three activist groups are planning protests outside -- sending a message that he is not welcomed in Chicago.\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson said he will make sure the former president gets the security he needs.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news",

It will be livestreamed at 1 p.m. ET on the group's Facebook and YouTube pages.\n\nThe event gives Trump, who won just 12% of Black voters in his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden, an opportunity to directly appeal to voters of color.\n\nBut he may have more trouble courting these voters in a competition against Harris, who is the first Black person, first woman and first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.\n\nSome polls already show that Harris has more support among Black, Latino and young voters than Biden did before she replaced him as the de facto Democratic nominee.\n\nOn Tuesday, a new Bloomberg/Morning Consult survey of battleground states found that Harris has effectively eliminated Trump's lead in the seven battleground states likely to determine which candidate wins the Electoral College.\n\nThe Trump campaign, in a press release Monday night announcing his NABJ appearance, claimed that he \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history.\"\n\nThe decision by NABJ, the nation's largest association of journalists of color, to host Trump quickly spurred a backlash both inside and outside the group.\n\nConvention co-chair Karen Attiah resigned her position on the eve of the event, writing in a social media post, \"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck.\"\n\nShe added in follow-up post, \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris' schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.\n\n\"The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,\" the person said. \"The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\n\"Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,\" the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. \"The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The Wednesday afternoon Trump event -- moderated by ABC News correspondent Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner, and Semafor politics reporter Kadia Goba -- has roiled the NABJ, with some of its most prominent members publicly expressing dismay.\n\nKaren Attiah, The Washington Post columnist who worked as co-chair of this year's conference, even announced Tuesday that she would resign from her role. While Attiah said a \"variety of factors\" influenced her decision, she specifically homed in on the Trump interview when making her abrupt announcement.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the fact that the former president, who has flirted with racist elements of his MAGA movement, had been invited to speak at the NABJ conference struck a particular nerve among many of its members.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the veteran White House correspondent and 2017 NABJ journalist of the year, wrote on X. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists ... who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda.\"\n\nBut while there was an outpouring of disapproval Tuesday, not everyone was in agreement. Symone Sanders, the former Kamala Harris spokesperson turned MSNBC host, wrote on X that \"some of the best journalists in the country are members of the NABJ\" and wondered, \"So why wouldn't they interview Trump?\"\n\n\"He is the Republican nominee. Seems like the journalists complaining don't understand their jobs are to actually ask the questions,\" Sanders argued. \"NABJ didn't platform Trump. The voters in the Republican primary did. Just like anyone else who is running for President, he should sit for serious interviews and answer real questions.\"\n\nAnd despite Trump's aggressive posture toward the press, his attendance at the NABJ as a presidential candidate would not be completely out of the ordinary. Former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have all attended accepted invitations to attend in recent decades.\n\nThe NABJ did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday, but in its announcement it said the Q&A with Trump, \"will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for the NABJ, while the organization has welcomed Trump to its stage to speak, it rejected requests by the Harris campaign to make accommodations for her to address the conference. A person familiar with the matter told CNN that Harris' schedule has been filled to the brim since her sudden ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket. To that end, she was unable to attend the Chicago conference in person. Her campaign did try to make an appearance work, the person said, but was rejected by the NABJ.\n\n\"The Harris for President campaign team worked very closely with NABJ leadership to find an alternative option,\" the person said. \"The NABJ team unfortunately denied a request for the VP to take part in a fireside chat virtually, or to host an in person fireside chat with the VP at a later date.\"\n\n\"Harris has always, and will always, value the NABJ and work to ensure Black reporters have a seat at the table,\" the person added, drawing a not-so-subtle contrast between the vice president and Trump. \"The Harris for President team still welcomes the opportunity to make one of the alternative options happen.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

She said she was not consulted about the move to platform Trump.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" she wrote in an X post.\n\nAttiah did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Lemon said Vice President Kamala Harris was also invited.

I'm not writing to endorse one candidate or tell you to vote.\n\nMy issue is with decision-makers distracting from a highly anticipated week of affirmation and education to invite someone who has before declined to be part of the NABJ convention and undermined the profession. It feels like our convention and organization is being used. (Also, as a 708 native, I dislike when people squarely focus on the negatives of the Chi.)\n\nNABJ leaders decided to platform a person who has insulted the convention's host city and its residents. In previous proclamations of using the military to address Chicago's crime and insinuating it could be eradicated in \"a day,\" Trump downplayed the racism, redlining and decades of disinvestment that create the city's cycles of poverty and violence. I hope Wednesday is a chance for him to outline his plan to strengthen Black families, education in Black communities and job opportunities in Chicago's poorest zip codes.\n\nI'm just not sure why he'd do that here at NABJ instead of speaking at a local church,chamber of commerce or community center.\n\nAs a journalist, I applaud uneasy conversations. As a daily newspaper editor, I engage in the \"both-siderism\" some decry, and I have defended the concept of intelligent objectivity. I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way.\n\nBut this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated.\n\nPeople shouldn't be asked to choose between attending a useful session or a self-serving side-show. They shouldn't be challenged to confront unsettling situations in an environment that is supposed to be welcoming for Black people. Uncomfortability and anxiety can be expected when the \"star\" of the opening day has repeatedly belittled our profession and questioned our intentions.\n\nThis is no doubt an excellent opportunity for the former president's image. But his outreach should be in the streets of Chicago. And I'm not lobbying for Democrats to show up to NABJ. I was looking forward to not seeing any politicians and forgetting for a few days that a high-stakes election is looming.\n\nNow NABJ as an organization, for the remainder of this campaign cycle, will be leveraged as a thin example of outreach.\n\nMy grievance isn't about political parties or who the best candidate is -- it's about maintaining the essence of the event.\n\nI was excited to attend my first NABJ convention after helping out at three separate chapters over the last decade-plus. The camaraderie I feel at local NABJ chapter meetings is refreshing and unique. About a dozen friends tell me the national convention is that times 10, something like a family reunion.\n\nAnd NABJ's greatness isn't born out of some challenging panel or cheeky debate -- the joy came from the togetherness. The turn-ups. The common respect. The shared struggles and triumphs of working in an isolating industry.\n\nInstead we get last-minute notice of a huge scheduling change with no opportunity for input, and a dismissive leadership hiding behind \"well, we've always done this,\" which is a poor excuse newsrooms often use to explain unpopular decisions. NABJ has dealt with a number of divisive topics and issues over the past several years and now has unnecessarily volunteered for another.\n\nOn Wednesday, I was going to renew my NABJ membership.

The release was posted just after 9 PM Chicago time to the NABJ website, two days ahead of the 2024 convention's opening day, July 31.\n\nAccording to the release, Trump is scheduled to talk at the gathering with a panel of three moderators, including Fox News host and anchor Harris Faulkner. In case you're not familiar, in 2023 while hosting the program Fox News Tonight, Faulkner used her opening monologue to opine that \"women and children are being redesigned by some sort of mad leftist science experiment,\" and that her pronouns are \"U.S.A.\"\n\nResponse to the news was swift from both NABJ members and others. Some members, participating in a spirited debate on the app formerly known as Twitter, pointed out that the organization has a tradition of inviting presidential candidates to address the convention. This dates back to at least 2004 when then candidate George W. Bush was the last Republican to accept the invitation before Trump. Journalist Jemele Hill wrote in a tweet, \"As journalists, we can never be afraid to tackle someone like Trump. The reality is that he is running for president and needs to be treated as such.\"\n\nBut as journalist Tyler J. Davis pointed out in a TRiiBE op-ed published on Tuesday, July 30, \"NABJ leaders decided to platform a person who has insulted the convention's host city and its residents.\" That same day, a coalition of Chicago organizations, including the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR), announced plans for a response rally outside the hotel timed around the convention kickoff to \"tell Trump he's not welcome in Chicago.\"\n\nAn alternative event\n\nThe local nonprofit Public Narrative invites the public to \"celebrate Black Chicago's contributions to journalism\" and attend the free panel discussion Leading Voices in Chicago's Black Storytelling featuring panelists Yohance Lacour (Invisible Institute), Tacuma Roeback (Chicago Defender), Morgan Elise Johnson (The TRiiBE), DeAnna Sherman (True Star Media), and moderator Natalie Moore.\n\nThu 8/1, 4:30-7 PM, Semicolon Books & Sweets, 400 N. Michigan, Suite 100; reserve tickets at Eventbrite\n\nFor their part, some members of the Chicago chapter of NABJ have pointed out that Trump's invitation was a decision made by the national organizers. And on Tuesday afternoon, Washington Post editor and columnist Karen Attiah announced her decision to step down as cochair of this year's convention.\n\nCandidate or not, it is a terrible decision to hand a platform to a person who during his previous campaigns regularly reposted and reshared messages from white supremacists and neo-Nazis and signed an executive order banning people from majority Muslim countries from entering the U.S. There's a big difference between a chance for a journalist to ask questions of a candidate in an open forum and the program that NABJ's national team seems to be organizing for this week. Will anyone ask Trump about the time he attacked Yamiche Alcindor in a press conference? Will he be forced to answer for past transgressions against journalists?\n\nNABJ is one of the largest journalists associations in the country and has several Reader staffers, contributors, and alumni in its membership ranks. I believe in the power of these associations to strengthen journalism.\n\nBut as a Chicagoan and an anti-racist, I cannot believe that this situation will be any different than the circus-like rallies we've seen from Trump's campaign in the past. And that's not fair to the NABJ members who deserve to spend their convention time comparing notes about better ways to report on the truth in our local communities.", "source": {"uri": "chicagoreader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Reader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "salem_collo_julin@chicagoreader.com", "name": "Salem Collo-Julin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hilton Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jemele Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

But Trump's acceptance of NABJ's invitation has led at least one high-profile group member to step down as a convention co-chair and others to argue their convention may become a platform for Trump to make false claims or be seen as winning NABJ's endorsement.\n\nTrump will be interviewed at 12 p.m. CDT Wednesday in Chicago by three reporters: Kadia Goba of Semafor, Rachel Scott of ABC News and Harris Faulkner of Fox News. Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee and first Black woman to hold her office, is not currently scheduled to address the convention. A person familiar with her schedule, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Harris campaign was unable to find a time to appear at NABJ in person and claimed the organization turned down an offer for her to appear virtually.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Some group members argued journalists should allow newsmakers to be heard, while others pointed to Trump's demeaning of prominent Black journalists while president and his frequent attacks on the free press, including labeling reporters \"the enemy of the people.\"\n\n\"I understand that the job should put us in tough situations if we're doing it in a meaningful way,\" wrote Tyler J. Davis, an NABJ member and freelance journalist, in The TRiiBE, a local Chicago Black news outlet.\n\n\"But this isn't a story assignment or a news conference or a newsroom. NABJ is a place of learning, networking and feeling supported. It's a space for Black folks to feel safe and celebrated; for Black media, specifically, to feel safe and celebrated,\" Davis wrote.\n\nKen Lemon, president of NABJ, insisted that the invitation was \"absolutely not an endorsement.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We invited both of them, we got a yes from one of them,\" Lemon said. \"We'd love to get a yes from Kamala as well, but in this case this is an important hour.\"\n\nLemon added that the event would be a \"great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground\" and added that the association had worked with both campaigns for \"probably for more than a month\" and each had given \"the inclination that both were interested in being a part of what we're doing.\"\n\nKaren Attiah, a global opinions columnist for The Washington Post, stepped down as the co-chair of the 2024 convention in the wake of the announcement of Trump's appearance.\n\n\"To the journalists interviewing Trump, I wish them the best of luck,\" Attiah wrote on social media. \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format,\" she continued.\n\nSome industry leaders pushed back on the claim that Black journalists should not take opportunities to interview Trump, noting that any opportunity to hold powerful figures to account should not be wasted and that NABJ as a forum is especially suited to that mission.\n\n\"To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous,\" Rana Cash, the executive editor of the Charlotte Observer and an NABJ member, wrote on X.\n\nAssociated Press writer Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Trump at a conference for Black journalists in Chicago has generated fierce debate.\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists, which is hosting the conference, announced on Monday that Mr. Trump would take part in a question-and-answer session with political reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe conference's description says the session will \"concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community.\" Harris Faulkner, a Fox News anchor; Kadia Goba, a politics reporter at Semafor; and Rachel Scott, an ABC News correspondent, will moderate the session. The event is expected to be live-streamed on the organization's YouTube and Facebook pages.\n\nAfter the announcement of the event with Mr. Trump, a number of well-known Black journalists harshly criticized the group for arranging it, arguing that the organization was giving a platform to someone who had openly denigrated a number of reporters.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then-president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" April Ryan, the White House correspondent for The Grio, a media company geared toward Black Americans, wrote on the social platform X. She said the session was \"a slap in the face\" to Black female journalists \"who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025.\"\n\nJemele Hill, who hosts a podcast and is contributing writer for The Atlantic, said that while she did not have a problem with Mr. Trump's appearance \"under the right circumstances because he's a presidential candidate,\" she questioned the wisdom of the event.\n\n\"A sham of an interview will destroy the organization's credibility,\" she wrote on X. \"If the majority of NABJ's membership is against Trump being there, the organization should listen.\"\n\nKaren Attiah, a Washington Post columnist, said on X on Tuesday that she was stepping down as co-chair of this year's N.A.B.J. convention. She added in another post: \"While my decision was influenced by a variety of factors, I was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nBut the president of the N.A.B.J., as well as some other journalists, argued that the group had a long tradition of inviting presidential nominees and it was a chance to hold them accountable through questioning. Former Presidents George W. Bush Jr., Barack Obama and Bill Clinton had all previously attended, and the group had invited the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, to this year's convention.\n\nIn a statement on N.A.B.J.'s website, its president, Ken Lemon, said that the organization looked forward to conference attendees' hearing from Mr. Trump.\n\n\"While N.A.B.J. does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know,\" Mr. Lemon said.\n\nIn a video posted on Tuesday by NABJ Monitor, a student journalist-led outlet covering the convention, Mr. Lemon said that discussions with both the Republican and Democratic teams had been happening for more than a month.\n\n\"We invited both of them; we got a yes from one of them,\" he said.\n\nHe continued: \"This is a great opportunity for us to vet the candidate right here on our ground.\"\n\nMr. Lemon said that N.A.B.J. was working to set up a fact-checking process for Mr. Trump's appearance.\n\nLeroy Chapman Jr., the editor in chief of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, said in a post on X that he looked forward to the Republican presidential nominee visiting the convention, and that he would welcome the presumptive Democratic nominee there too.\n\n\"Here is what we need to 'normalize' -- candidates for office standing before journalists, answering questions,\" he wrote.\n\nRana Cash, the executive editor of The Charlotte Observer, said on X: \"It's the National Association of Black 'Journalists' -- journalists who are experts at their craft, highly qualified and critical thinkers. To suggest they not interview a Presidential candidate on issues relevant to the organization's constituency is outrageous.\"\n\nFor nearly a decade, there have been furious journalistic debates about the degree to which Mr. Trump should be given a platform, given his propensity to lie and make false claims in speeches. The appearance at a conference for Black journalists adds more complexity: Mr. Trump has frequently denigrated working journalists and has a history of racist comments about Black voters.\n\nMr. Trump's presidential campaign said in a news release on Monday announcing his appearance at the N.A.B.J. convention that he had \"accomplished more for Black Americans than any other president in recent history.\" The campaign also pointed to an April poll in The Wall Street Journal that showed increased support for Mr. Trump among Black men.\n\nJaniyah Thomas, director of Black media for Mr. Trump's campaign, wrote in an email: \"While Kamala Harris has ignored the invitation from the National Association of Black Journalists, President Trump is grateful for the opportunity to bring his message to their diverse audience. Team Trump believes it's important to give Black journalists more access to presidential candidates so they can better inform Black voters.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGrio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TheGrio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Correspondents'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Correspondents' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jemele Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Ryan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "April Ryan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Read more opinions on theGrio.\n\nMy grandmother was a follower of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nEvery day at sunrise, noon and sunset, she rested all 128 pounds of her body weight on her 74-year-old, cartilage-depleted knees to thank her Lord and Savior for his mercy and grace. In exchange for his divine protection, she lived by the letter of the Mosaic law. She did not steal. She did not bear false witness. And no human being who ever had the honor of basking in the glorious presence of Marvell Harriot would use profanity in her company.\n\nUntil she gave her grandson a lesson on blessing, biblical cussing and -- most of all -- journalism.\n\nAt 6 years old, I was either a juvenile storytelling prodigy or my mother's mother was the most talented improvisational actress in history. Grumma listened patiently to every single word of my rambling childhood stories. She howled with laughter at my jokes and asked follow-up questions. Yet, when I briefly forgot about her anointing, I knew I was in trouble. \"Goddamnit!\" I yelled while performing a spot-on impersonation of my foul-mouthed uncle's reaction to a bee sting. \"Goddamn these goddamned bees done stung-\"\n\nFreezing midsentence as my grandma's guffaws transformed into shock, I hung my head as she stared at her heretofore favorite grandson. \"You can say it,\" said my grandmother, shattering the awkward silence. \"Long as you ain't bearin' false witness. It's not a sin if it's the truth.\"\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nI still wasn't buying it. Not only had I used the Lord's name in vain, I might have killed my grandmother. What if my obscene language penetrated Granny's Holy Ghost deflector shield? Breaking two of the top 10 Commandments at once would surely send me straight to hell. But when she said: \"Baby, yo ox in the ditch,\" I immediately felt relief. She wanted me to be free.\n\nGrumma was referencing Luke 14. According to the story, a guest at a Pharisee cookout suggested that Jesus was violating his daddy's rules by healing a sick man on God's designated day off. \"What if your child or your ox falls into a ditch on the Sabbath day,\" asked God's vice president in charge of prayer relations \"Would you let them die or would you pull it out?\" While the Pharisees didn't have an answer, if the National Association of Black Journalists wrote the Bible, the scripture would probably be different:\n\nIt is a fact that Trump told the 2017 NABJ Journalist of the Year to \"sit down\" when theGrio's White House Correspondent and Washington Bureau Chief April Ryan confronted him about voter suppression. During a White House press briefing, Trump's press secretary called for 2018 Journalist of the Year Jemele Hill to be fired. After 2020 NABJ Journalist of the Year Yamiche Alcindor caught him in a lie, Trump wondered why \"you people act\" so negatively, warning Alcindor to \"be nice.\" Yet those attacks pale in comparison to Trump's tweets about Black journalist Don Lemon.\n\nApparently, none of that matters.\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States of America, will participate in a conversation with journalists at the National Association of Black Journalists Annual Convention and Career Fair on Wednesday, July 31, 2024, at 12:00 PM CST,\" read a press release by from the lying, aspiring dictator who levied racial attacks against NABJ members. \"President Trump will engage in a Q&A with political journalists before an audience of registered convention attendees that will concentrate on the most pressing issues facing the Black community. The event will be moderated by Rachel Scott, senior congressional correspondent for ABC News; Harris Faulkner, anchor of The Faulkner Focus and co-host of Outnumbered on FOX News; and Kadia Goba, politics reporter at Semafor.\"\n\nAlthough Donald Trump describes all media as the \"enemy of the people,\" NABJ Political Journalism Task Force chair Tia Mitchell was technically correct when she claimed Trump's appearance is \"in line with invitations NABJ has sent to every presidential candidate for decades.\" According to the age-old notion of \"journalistic objectivity,\" I believe we should treat all political candidates equally. But who cares about the rules of objectivity? The letter of the law is less important than the spirit of the law. Whether they serve as religious principles, moral codes or ethical guidelines, the most effective rules are created in service of an outcome, not just to regulate behavior. This universal concept is so simple that a 6-year-old storyteller, a septuagenarian grandparent and even the greatest nepo baby ever born can understand.\n\nEven though I am a dues-paying NABJ member, my feelings about Donald Trump are inconsequential. It is not my opinion that Black journalists make up 6% of the profession. It is not my opinion that ESPN, CNN and MSNBC did nothing to protect employees like Hill, Lemon and Tiffany Cross from racist attacks. As someone who attends the NABJ national convention every year and is also scheduled to lead a convention panel on Project 2025, my belief should not matter. However, NABJ's stated purpose is \"sensitizing all media to the importance of fairness in the workplace for Black journalists\" is what matters. An organization that \"advocates for Black journalists worldwide\" matters. It is not my opinion that welcoming Donald Trump to a place created to protect Black journalists is like asking a slave catcher to the abolitionist's meeting. Yet, behind the scenes, some of your favorite media icons are clamoring to bask in the orange glow of the biggest threat to democracy since the MAGA minions tried to disappear the ballots of Black voters and overthrow the country we built.\n\nAnd, for what?\n\nIf the greatest Black journalists who ever existed manage to expose Donald Trump for the vile, racist, wannabe dictator that he is, will we learn anything new? Even if they manage to achieve the most rigorous interrogation of the aspiring dictator to date, how many minds will they change? What are they trying to show us about this hate monger that we haven't already seen? I thought we were going to \"protect Black women\"? How are we \"saving democracy\" while aiding and abetting the man who wants to destroy it? Whose minds are they trying to change anyway? Who are they trying to prove themselves to?\n\nThe answer is \"white people.\"\n\nWhite people are the reason the NABJ exists. We already know white people don't trust our voices or care about us. If they did, we wouldn't need an NABJ. If white people listened to Black people, Donald Trump wouldn't be a presidential candidate in the first place. We are the only ones who believe in performatively following a set of arbitrary rules that we have the power to change. Ask the women who can't get an abortion because Trump stripped them of their reproductive rights. Ask the \"diversity hires\" and the people who were victimized by the Trump-inspired rise in white supremacy.\n\nAsk my grumma.\n\nGod damn Donald Trump and the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nI would never use the Lord's name in vain. Then again, it is not a sin if it is the truth. I want God to damn his presidential campaign. I want my ancestors to smite the false notion of appealing to white sensibilities that fosters an allegiance to ideas and rules created to harm Black people. I want us to protect Black women and ourselves. But more than anything ...\n\nI want us to be free.", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_harriot@thegrio.com", "name": "Michael

However, a recent addition to its speaker lineup is leading some onlookers to believe the move is the antithesis of the event's mission.\n\nOn July 29, it was reported that former President Donald J. Trump will participate in a conversation with journalists during its opening day in Chicago on Wednesday, July 31, at noon CST. The conversation would be moderated by ABC News's Rachel Scott, Fox News host Harris Faulkner and Kadia Goba Semafor, a politics reporter who covered Congress for Axios and BuzzFeed News.\n\nJournalists took to X to express their thoughts on the addition, with many vehemently opposing it, claiming the move was counterproductive.\n\nSome users pointed to Trump's fraught relationship with Chicago, the location the convention will be taking place this year. The city's Mayor, Brandon Johnson stated that the Chicago's city departments are 'fully prepared to uphold safety', a reference to the Trump's track record of inciting violent loyalists at public events.\n\nDuring his 2016 election run, Trump blamed President Obama for the blighted conditions some Chicagoans faced in his \"home town\" during the Republican National Convention, and subsequently almost obsessively mentioned Chicago in a negative light during his public speeches.\n\n\"We have a situation where we have our inner cities - African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous,\" Trump said in September 2016 presidential debate. \"You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1. Thousands of shootings. And I say, where is this? Is this is a war-torn country? What are we doing?\"\n\nOther X users pointed out that NABJ is a non-partisan organization and have invited past Presidential candidates from both sides of the aisle to participate in the convention.\n\n\"People really upset about Trump speaking at NABJ? The organization is non partisan,\" one user wrote. \"I think some of y'all forget that the job of journalists are to ask the questions, regardless of who they are. This isn't CNN. NABJ doesn't monetarily gain anything by doing this.\"", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loyalist (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inner city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1005577332-1200x900.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774346", "eventUri": "eng-9774346", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 297}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 453, "textEnd": 460}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1703}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 1553, "textEnd": 1567}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Bush spoke at a conference they co-hosted in 2004.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be interviewed on Wednesday afternoon at the event by three Black women journalists, Fox News' Harris Faulkner, ABC News' Rachel Scott and Semafor's Kadia Goba.\n\nSome members said the group should not offer a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the work of Black journalists, sometimes in personal terms. Trump has also used racist and dehumanizing language on the campaign trail.\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Attiah stepped down as a co-chair from the convention, saying on social media that she had not been \"involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nIn Chicago, a protest was expected outside the venue where Trump was scheduled to speak. Trump has regularly criticized the city's largely Democratic political leadership for Chicago's levels of street violence.\n\n\"Here is what we need to 'normalize' - candidates for office standing before journalists, answering questions,\" said Leroy Chapman Jr, editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a newspaper.\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists includes a range of members, from reporters with legacy media outlets that hope to preserve a working relationship with Trump to Black-owned outlets and journalists whose work takes a stridently anti-Trump tone.\n\nTrump made his resentful relationship with many of the media outlets who cover him a focus of his 2016, 2020 and 2024 campaigns and sparred with members of the White House press corps during his 2017-2021 presidency.\n\nNow, Trump's campaign faces a likely race against Vice President Kamala Harris as she seeks to be the first Black and Asian woman president, the prospect of which has drawn millions of dollars in donations to the Democrat's campaign.\n\nBiden was planning to attend this year's convention before he dropped his presidential bid on July 21.\n\nHarris, who was invited, could not make it to Chicago in person but is willing to participate in a virtual fireside chat with the organization, according to a person familiar with her plans.\n\nAs a candidate, Biden had been struggling to mobilize Black voters, especially Black men, allowing Trump to make inroads with that demographic.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed Harris slightly increasing her support from Black voters over Biden's numbers, with 73%, up from Biden's 69% earlier in July and Trump's support dropping to 10%, from 15%. Nine in 10 Black voters supported Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump has been actively courting Black voters and has held events in cities with large Black populations, including Atlanta, where he plans a rally on Saturday.\n\n\"For us as journalists, people who go into and have very uncomfortable conversations for the sake of our members, this is an important time,\" National Association of Black Journalists president Ken Lemon said on social media. \"This is a great opportunity for us to vet the candidate.\"\n\nThe organization picked the moderators, there were no preconditions for Trump to appear and he was not given questions in advance, according to people familiar with the campaign's planning for the session.\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, Tyler Clifford, Bianca Flowers, Tim Reid and Jim Oliphant; Editing by Michael Perry)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

He's scheduled to participate in a Q&A session, with Rachel Scott of ABC News, Harris Faulkner of FOX News and Kadia Goba of Semafor serving as moderators.\n\nWilliams: From George Floyd to Sonya Massey, still waiting for justice\n\n\"While NABJ does not endorse political candidates as a journalism organization, we understand the serious work of our members, and welcome the opportunity for them to ask the tough questions that will provide the truthful answers Black Americans want and need to know,\" NABJ president Ken Lemon said on the organization's website.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That's a fine practice in times when the future of democracy is not on the ballot and rogue jurists have not functioned as wholly owned subsidiaries of MAGA Inc. in placing Trump above the law. But this is no time to embrace the banality of bothsidesism.\n\nWilliams: Demonizing DEI is the latest GOP dog whistle\n\nThe nostalgia that frames Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" sloganeering is a rejection of Black uplift and advancement.\n\nTrump was the lead dog-whistler in the racist birther lie that Barack Obama was a noncitizen and illegitimate president. He tried the same stunt on Kamala Harris, the California-born daughter of immigrants of Jamaican and South Asian descent.\n\nHe instituted a ban against Muslim immigrants. His past and present campaigns have been centered on fear-mongering of would-be immigrants from Latin America. He found \"very fine people, on both sides\" in the aftermath of a Charlottesville rally of Nazis and other white supremacists that turned deadly. And several months before the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, he told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\"\n\nAll of this has helped make him the favored candidate of white supremacists, who've attacked Usha Vance, the wife of Trump running mate JD Vance, because she is Indian-American and Hindu.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump allies have been pushing an agenda to purge America of all vestiges of diversity, equity and inclusion. (They must be hating the gold medal-winning U.S. women's gymnastics team right now.)\n\nIn this context, it takes a lot of mental gymnastics to view Trump as a supporter of Black people.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nJournalists have no obligation to disseminate misinformation, Trump's specialty. NABJ's stated role is as an advocacy group for Black journalists and media professionals. And Trump's contempt for Black journalists was on vivid display during his presidency.\n\nWilliams: Political violence? This is who we are\n\nApril Ryan, White House correspondent for The Grio, objected to Trump's appearance at NABJ in a social media post.\n\n\"The reports of attacks on Black women White House correspondents by the then president of the United States are not myth or conjecture, but fact,\" Ryan wrote. \"To have a presumed orchestrated session with the former president is an affront to what this organization stands for and a slap in the face to the Black women journalists (NABJ journalists of the year) who had to protect themselves from the wrath of this Republican presidential nominee who is promoting an authoritarian agenda that plans to destroy this nation and her democracy with his Project 2025.\"\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Attiah stepped down as co-chair of the convention, posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, that she \"was not involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nI saw this hens-invites-fox scenario play out in July 1998, when the National Bar Association, the nation's largest Black lawyers group, invited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to their Memphis, Tennessee, gathering amid internal conflict. On that occasion, Thomas offered no apologies for his record and painted himself as a victim.\n\nHow'd that turn out for us?\n\nIt would be astonishing for any NABJ-member question, no matter how penetrating, to extract a meaningful response from a guy whose superpower is his imperviousness to accountability. It should be clear ever since the Access Hollywood tape that nothing Trump says will cool the ardor of his devoted supporters.\n\nWilliams: Is America approaching its expiration date?\n\nConversely, Trump can't lose by appearing in Chicago, a city he has used as fear-stoking shorthand for the perils of urban America. If the questions are too hard-hitting for his taste, he'll do what he does best: play the victim. If he lashes out at Black journalists, his followers will cheer. And if he comes off as reasonable, or even charming, it might bolster his inexplicable support among some Black voters.\n\nTrying to extract substance from Trump is a fool's errand, for reasons beyond his rambling stream-of-consciousness incoherence. Journalists cannot divine truths from a man seemingly incapable of mouthing them. Instead, this invite confers credibility on a guy who -- if we were truly a nation of laws and not of men -- would be behind bars instead of campaigning for president.\n\nThere's a weird compulsion in the media, and a chunk of the electorate, to not take Trump's words and actions at face value even as he says the incriminating part out loud. He said he has no plans to be a dictator \"except for day one\" -- and America shrugged. He told a gathering of Christian conservatives that if they support him this time around, \"In four years, you don't have to vote again.\" In March, American Conservative, a partner of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 wish list for a second Trump term, argued on behalf of overturning the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms.\n\nIt's as if America hadn't heard Trump express admiration for dictators or witness his attempt to overturn the 2020 election -- he's still repeating the lie that it was stolen. Somehow, despite the plain language of the 14th Amendment barring those who have \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\" from holding office again, America is giving Trump a chance to return to the White House.\n\nBlack journalists, part of America's most enduringly vulnerable population, should realize this is no ordinary election. The focus in Chicago should be on nurturing Black journalism professionals, not making news.\n\nThere isn't ground high enough to justify this invite. It's never wise to hand a megaphone to a madman.\n\nPHOTOS: Trump rally in Richmond\n\nMichael Paul Williams (804) 649-6815\n\nmwilliams@timesdispatch.com\n\nMichael Paul Williams\n\nColumnist\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Michael Paul Williams Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

NABJ Officials Face Major Backlash For Inviting Donald Trump To Panel Discussion", "body": "Blacks For Trump?! NABJ Officials Face Major Backlash For Inviting Donald Trump To Panel Discussion\n\nDonald Trump is very likely the most polarizing public figure in modern American history. Anything, anyone, or any group associated with him is instantly subject to criticism, ridicule, and insult. This vitriolic reaction isn't an immature emotional reaction, it is deeply grounded in the knowledge and experience that Donald John Trump, 53% of white women's favorite POTUS, is a cataloged liar, a habitual scammer, and as sista Jemele Hill so succinctly stated, a white supremacist. That was just the short list of Trump's undignified accomplishments but the rabbit hole goes deep, we could go further, we promise.\n\nWe say all that to say that inviting said individual to a Black a** function is not only bad PR but poor judgment and inexplicable malpractice. However, that is exactly what the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) has decided to do. Chaos erupted on Twitter last night after the organization announced that Trump would be in attendance at the 2024 conference this week.\n\nInstantly, everyone from prominent Black journalists to people who have no connection to professional media whatsoever began collectively scratching their heads and firing off soul-piercing tweets toward NABJ, the chairperson, and the organization's president.\n\nChairwoman Tia Mitchell spent much of the evening trying to justify her decision which only further irritated the members who were appalled at her lack of foresight, care, or consideration.\n\nNABJ President, Ken Lemon attempted to clean up aisle 6 but the damage was already done...\n\nSome folks are defending NABJ's decision to have Trump as a platform to ask \"tough questions\" or \"seek truth\" or whatever other silly journalistic mantras that some feel emotionally beholden to. Donald Trump is not just some \"presidential candidate\". He's all the aforementioned adjectives we used above and much more (see, \"worse\").

Bush spoke at a conference they co-hosted in 2004.\n\nTrump is scheduled to be interviewed on Wednesday afternoon at the event by three Black women journalists, Fox News' Harris Faulkner, ABC News' Rachel Scott and Semafor's Kadia Goba.\n\nSome members said the group should not offer a platform to Trump, who has denigrated the work of Black journalists, sometimes in personal terms. Trump has also used racist and dehumanizing language on the campaign trail.\n\nWashington Post columnist Karen Attiah stepped down as a co-chair from the convention, saying on social media that she had not been \"involved or consulted with in any way with the decision to platform Trump in such a format.\"\n\nIn Chicago, a protest was expected outside the venue where Trump was scheduled to speak. Trump has regularly criticized the city's largely Democratic political leadership for Chicago's levels of street violence.\n\n\"Here is what we need to 'normalize' - candidates for office standing before journalists, answering questions,\" said Leroy Chapman Jr, editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, a newspaper.\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists includes a range of members, from reporters with legacy media outlets that hope to preserve a working relationship with Trump to Black-owned outlets and journalists whose work takes a stridently anti-Trump tone.\n\nTrump made his resentful relationship with many of the media outlets who cover him a focus of his 2016, 2020 and 2024 campaigns and sparred with members of the White House press corps during his 2017-2021 presidency.\n\nNow, Trump's campaign faces a likely race against Vice President Kamala Harris as she seeks to be the first Black and Asian woman president, the prospect of which has drawn millions of dollars in donations to the Democrat's campaign.\n\nBiden was planning to attend this year's convention before he dropped his presidential bid on July 21.\n\nHarris, who was invited, could not make it to Chicago in person but is willing to participate in a virtual fireside chat with the organization, according to a person familiar with her plans.\n\nAs a candidate, Biden had been struggling to mobilize Black voters, especially Black men, allowing Trump to make inroads with that demographic.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed Harris slightly increasing her support from Black voters over Biden's numbers, with 73%, up from Biden's 69% earlier in July and Trump's support dropping to 10%, from 15%. Nine in 10 Black voters supported Biden in 2020.\n\nTrump has been actively courting Black voters and has held events in cities with large Black populations, including Atlanta, where he plans a rally on Saturday.\n\n\"For us as journalists, people who go into and have very uncomfortable conversations for the sake of our members, this is an important time,\" National Association of Black Journalists president Ken Lemon said on social media. \"This is a great opportunity for us to vet the candidate.\"\n\nThe organization picked the moderators, there were no preconditions for Trump to appear and he was not given questions in advance, according to people familiar with the campaign's planning for the session.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Faulkner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris Faulkner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Black_Journalists", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Black Journalists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

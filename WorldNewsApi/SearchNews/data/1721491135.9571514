{"id": 237090878, "title": "'House Of The Dragon's Blood & Cheese Scene Changed From The Book", "text": "No sooner did House of the Dragon fly back onto TV screens before the fandom complaints blazed up in yet another wildfire of backlash. The latest gripe has to do with a pivotal scene in the Season 2 premiere, which left fans of the book extremely underwhelmed. Amid the controversy, showrunner Ryan Condal explained why the series had to make such a big change, which unfortunately left a highly anticipated moment feeling a bit watered down. The Season 2 premiere wasted no time in adapting one of the most infamous scenes in George R. R. Martin\u2019s 2018 novel Fire & Blood. Known among fans as the \u201cBlood and Cheese\u201d scene, the brutal event follows two hired assassins \u2014 named Blood and Cheese \u2014 as they sneak into the Targaryen castle and murder King Aegon\u2019s young son. In the books, this moment is impossibly traumatic, as the assassins force Queen Helaena to pick one of her sons for them to kill in front of her. Helaena begs them to kill her instead, but eventually relents and points to her younger son Maelor. Instead, Blood and Cheese kill her other son Jaehaerys, and leave Maelor with the knowledge that his mother was willing to have him killed. It\u2019s such a shockingly sadistic moment that it\u2019s been held up as the prequel book\u2019s version of Game of Thrones\u2019 Red Wedding. But... it didn\u2019t really hold up on screen. The show erased Maelor as a character, so Blood and Cheese made Helaena point out which of her identical twins was a boy, and killed him. Fans complained the quicker-than-expected scene removed a lot of the gravitas from the book. After the scene aired, showrunner Ryan Condal explained to The Hollywood Reporter that the condensed timeline of the show was why the Blood and Cheese scene was altered. \u201cThe book covered 30-plus years, and we crunched it down to 20,\u201d Condal said. \u201cOne of the side effects is you have: Rhaenyra and Daemon\u2019s children are much younger than they were in the book, as are Helaena and Aegon\u2019s children. They haven\u2019t been together long enough to have two generations of kids. So Maelor does not yet exist, and we only have the twins.\u201d \u201cSo working from that place, we just wanted to try to make Blood and Cheese a visceral television sequence,\u201d Condal continued. \u201cWe decided to tell it from their point of view and make it like a heist gone wrong. Whereas in the book, it\u2019s depicted purely from Helaena and Alicent\u2019s perspective. Blood and Cheese come upon Helaena, and she\u2019s sort of the third act of their story. The idea was to build suspense and dread as they\u2019re looking for Aemond, whom Daemon names as the target, and then you put two criminals into a situation with gold in front of their faces and things can go wrong.\u201d", "summary": "Longtime 'House of the Dragon' fans were eagerly awaiting one terrifying scene in Season 2.

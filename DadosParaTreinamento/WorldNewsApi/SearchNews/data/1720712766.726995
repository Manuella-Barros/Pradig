Setting off from the Inverness Ice Centre, the 160-mile route took in Dava Moor with a loop round Lochindorb, Speyside then up into Glenlivet to the lunch halt in Tomintoul. The return leg meandered through Strathspey and then past Moy before heading south down Strathnairn and the final leg along Loch Ness. A wide variety of cars ranging from the 1950s to more modern vehicles caught the attention of the public at both the start and finish venue, and in Tomintoul, with cars and crews attracting plenty of admiring looks and questions. Organisers Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness announced at the post-tour awards ceremony that a sum of over \u00a33000 had been raised for this year\u2019s beneficiaries, CHAS (Children\u2019s Hospices Across Scotland) and the Highlands and Islands Blood Bikes. Then came the presentation of a special \u201cFair Play\u201d award which had been gifted to the tour by Mrs Louise Wall in memory of her late husband Ranald Bruce. The couple had enjoyed many classic car Tours both in Scotland and across Europe, but the Highlands had always held a special attraction. The award, a pair of engraved wooden charcuterie platters, was presented by family friend Andrew Cowan from Kingussie to the crew of the Austin A105 Vanden Plas, George and Ian Keir of Dufftown, in recognition of their outstanding support of the Tour ever since its inception. The crew\u2019s classic vintage cars were noted for how immaculately presented they were each year along with their \u201cfriendly disposition\u201d. Tour co-organiser Ormond Smith closed by expressing his thanks and appreciation to the tour entrants for \u201ctheir continued support of the event and the generosity of the sponsorship received which will be put to good use by both main charities\u201d. Mr Smith also announced a date of June 7, 2025 for next year\u2019s tour, before wishing all the participants a safe journey back home. Do you want to respond to this article?
